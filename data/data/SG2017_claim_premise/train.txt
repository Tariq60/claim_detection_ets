Should O
students O
be O
taught O
to O
compete O
or O
to O
cooperate O
? O

It O
is O
always O
said O
that O
competition O
can O
effectively O
promote O
the O
development O
of O
economy O
. O

In O
order O
to O
survive O
in O
the O
competition O
, O
companies O
continue O
to O
improve O
their O
products O
and O
service O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
the O
whole O
society O
prospers O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we O
discuss O
the O
issue O
of O
competition O
or O
cooperation O
, O
what O
we O
are O
concerned O
about O
is O
not O
the O
whole O
society O
, O
but O
the O
development O
of O
an O
individual O
's O
whole O
life O
. O

From O
this O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
we B-claim
should I-claim
attach I-claim
more I-claim
importance I-claim
to I-claim
cooperation I-claim
during I-claim
primary I-claim
education I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
through B-claim
cooperation I-claim
, I-claim
children I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
about I-claim
interpersonal I-claim
skills I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
significant I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
of I-claim
all I-claim
students I-claim
. O

What B-premise
we I-premise
acquired I-premise
from I-premise
team I-premise
work I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
goal I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
but I-premise
more I-premise
importantly I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
along I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

During B-premise
the I-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
cooperation I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
opinions I-premise
of I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
comprehensively I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
compromise I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
team I-premise
members I-premise
when I-premise
conflicts I-premise
occurred I-premise
. O

All B-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
skills I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
on I-premise
well I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
will I-premise
benefit I-premise
them I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
life I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the B-premise
significance I-premise
of I-premise
competition I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
excellence I-premise
to I-premise
gain I-premise
the I-premise
victory I-premise
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
always O
said O
that O
competition B-claim
makes I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
more I-claim
effective I-claim
. O

However O
, O
when B-premise
we I-premise
consider I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
question I-premise
that I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
win I-premise
the I-premise
game I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
always I-premise
find I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
need I-premise
the I-premise
cooperation I-premise
. O

The O
greater O
our O
goal O
is O
, O
the O
more O
competition O
we O
need O
. O

Take B-premise
Olympic I-premise
games I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
form I-premise
of I-premise
competition I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
imagine I-premise
how I-premise
an I-premise
athlete I-premise
could I-premise
win I-premise
the I-premise
game I-premise
without I-premise
the I-premise
training I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
coach I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
other I-premise
professional I-premise
staffs I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
diet I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
charge I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
medical I-premise
care I-premise
. O

The O
winner O
is O
the O
athlete O
but O
the O
success O
belongs O
to O
the O
whole O
team O
. O

Therefore O
without B-claim
the I-claim
cooperation I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
no I-claim
victory I-claim
of I-claim
competition I-claim
. O

Consequently O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
view O
of O
individual O
development O
or O
the O
relationship O
between O
competition O
and O
cooperation O
we O
can O
receive O
the O
same O
conclusion O
that O
a B-claim
more I-claim
cooperative I-claim
attitudes I-claim
towards I-claim
life I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
profitable I-claim
in I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
success I-claim
. O

More O
people O
are O
migrating O
to O
other O
countries O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
50 O
years O
have O
seen O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
immigrants O
to O
other O
countries O
. O

People O
moved O
due O
to O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
, O
namely O
better O
educations O
or O
higher O
salary O
jobs O
. O

Some O
people O
thought O
that O
they O
should O
follow O
the O
local O
customs O
in O
order O
to O
integrate O
into O
their O
adopted O
countries O
’ O
cultures O
. O

However O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
they B-claim
are I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
sustain I-claim
their I-claim
cultural I-claim
identities I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
so I-claim
help I-claim
they I-claim
keep I-claim
their I-claim
origin I-claim
values I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
maintaining B-premise
one I-premise
’s I-premise
cultural I-premise
identity I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
key I-premise
important I-premise
rule I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
individuals I-premise
emerge I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
multicultural I-premise
environments I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
Australia I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
immigrants I-premise
from I-premise
varieties I-premise
of I-premise
nations I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
day I-premise
called I-premise
multicultural I-premise
day I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
each I-premise
country I-premise
prepare I-premise
their I-premise
food I-premise
and I-premise
traditional I-premise
activities I-premise
for I-premise
displaying I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
venues I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
Australians I-premise
come I-premise
this I-premise
day I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
the I-premise
shows I-premise
, I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
cultures I-premise
and I-premise
admire I-premise
the I-premise
diverse I-premise
values I-premise
. O

These B-premise
feedbacks I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
, I-premise
help I-premise
raise I-premise
one I-premise
’s I-premise
pride I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
cultures I-premise
and I-premise
help I-premise
people I-premise
understand I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
more I-premise
. O

Thus O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
sustaining B-claim
the I-claim
cultural I-claim
values I-claim
of I-claim
immigrants I-claim
is I-claim
paramount I-claim
essential I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
crucial I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
one I-premise
’s I-premise
identity I-premise
for O
they B-premise
need I-premise
a I-premise
connection I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
teach I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
their I-premise
value I-premise
of I-premise
origin I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
children B-premise
immigrated I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
country I-premise
will I-premise
face I-premise
social I-premise
troubles I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
with I-premise
new I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

In B-premise
this I-premise
new I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
parent I-premise
should I-premise
find I-premise
friends I-premise
coming I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
same I-premise
country I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
socialize I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
familiar I-premise
manner I-premise
as I-premise
feeling I-premise
being I-premise
home I-premise
. O

Fail B-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
this I-premise
familiarity I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
felt I-premise
isolated I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
extreme I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
social I-premise
disorder I-premise
like I-premise
autism I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
keeping B-claim
the I-claim
cultural I-claim
traditions I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
destination I-claim
countries I-claim
is I-claim
tremendous I-claim
important I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
although O
there B-claim
are I-claim
opposing I-claim
ideas I-claim
of I-claim
neglecting I-claim
one I-claim
’s I-claim
cultural I-claim
values I-claim
to I-claim
adapt I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
cultures I-claim
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
sustaining B-claim
the I-claim
traditions I-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
immigrated I-claim
people I-claim
keep I-claim
their I-claim
cultural I-claim
identity I-claim
and I-claim
give I-claim
them I-claim
confident I-claim
among I-claim
the I-claim
many I-claim
culture I-claim
society I-claim
. O

International O
tourism O
is O
now O
more O
common O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
decade O
has O
seen O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
tourists O
traveling O
to O
visit O
natural O
wonder O
sights O
, O
ancient O
heritages O
and O
different O
cultures O
around O
the O
world O
. O

While O
some O
people O
might O
think O
that O
this O
international O
tourism O
has O
negative O
effects O
on O
the O
destination O
countries O
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
it B-claim
has I-claim
contributed I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
economic I-claim
development I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
preserved I-claim
the I-claim
culture I-claim
and I-claim
environment I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
tourist I-claim
destinations I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
international B-premise
tourism I-premise
promotes I-premise
many I-premise
aspects I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
destination I-premise
country I-premise
’s I-premise
economy I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
serve I-premise
various I-premise
demands I-premise
of I-premise
tourists I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
Cambodia I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
visitors I-premise
coming I-premise
to I-premise
visit I-premise
the I-premise
Angkowat I-premise
ancient I-premise
temple I-premise
need I-premise
services I-premise
like I-premise
restaurants I-premise
, I-premise
hotels I-premise
, I-premise
souvenir I-premise
shops I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
stores I-premise
. O

These B-premise
demands I-premise
trigger I-premise
related I-premise
business I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
surrounding I-premise
settings I-premise
which I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
create I-premise
many I-premise
jobs I-premise
for I-premise
local I-premise
people I-premise
improve I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
and I-premise
living I-premise
standard I-premise
. O

Therefore O
tourism B-claim
has I-claim
clearly I-claim
improved I-claim
lives I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
tourist I-claim
country I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
through B-premise
tourism I-premise
industry I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
cultural I-premise
values I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
preserved I-premise
and I-premise
natural I-premise
environments I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
protected I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
Vietnam I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
cultural I-premise
costumes I-premise
and I-premise
natural I-premise
scenes I-premise
, I-premise
namely I-premise
‘ I-premise
Trong I-premise
Dong I-premise
’ I-premise
drum I-premise
performance I-premise
and I-premise
‘ I-premise
Ha I-premise
Long I-premise
’ I-premise
bay I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
being I-premise
encouraged I-premise
to I-premise
preserve I-premise
and I-premise
funded I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
tourism I-premise
ministry I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
this I-premise
support I-premise
and I-premise
profit I-premise
from I-premise
tourism I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
traditional I-premise
cultures I-premise
would I-premise
disappear I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
its I-premise
low I-premise
income I-premise
works I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
tourism B-claim
has I-claim
survived I-claim
many I-claim
non I-claim
- I-claim
tangible I-claim
cultural I-claim
values I-claim
and I-claim
beauty I-claim
scenes I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
international B-claim
tourism I-claim
has I-claim
both I-claim
triggered I-claim
economic I-claim
development I-claim
and I-claim
maintained I-claim
cultural I-claim
and I-claim
environment I-claim
values I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
tourist I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
authorities O
should O
adequately O
support O
these O
sustainable O
developments O
. O

Will O
newspapers O
become O
a O
thing O
of O
the O
past O
? O

The O
internet O
has O
been O
more O
and O
more O
popular O
for O
recent O
years O
, O
providing O
people O
with O
a O
huge O
source O
of O
information O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
print O
media O
such O
as O
newspapers O
have O
experienced O
a O
dramatic O
decline O
in O
the O
number O
of O
readers O
. O

Some O
people O
, O
however O
, O
still O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
exist O
for O
long O
time O
; O
others O
disagree O
, O
arguing O
that O
newspapers B-claim
have I-claim
lost I-claim
their I-claim
competitive I-claim
advantage I-claim
to I-claim
sustain I-claim
their I-claim
prolonged I-claim
existence I-claim
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
view O
for O
following O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
to B-premise
obtain I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
using I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
is I-premise
quicker I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
convenient I-premise
than I-premise
reading I-premise
newspapers I-premise
. O

Contrary B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
when I-premise
people I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
wait I-premise
long I-premise
hours I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
daily I-premise
newspaper I-premise
, I-premise
nowadays I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
acquire I-premise
latest I-premise
news I-premise
updated I-premise
every I-premise
second I-premise
through I-premise
their I-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
or I-premise
computers I-premise
connected I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
everywhere I-premise
and I-premise
at I-premise
anytime I-premise
. O

As B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
devices I-premise
and I-premise
machines I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
common I-premise
in I-premise
all I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
making I-premise
it I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
things I-premise
that I-premise
newspapers I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
provide I-premise
in I-premise
only I-premise
some I-premise
pages I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
the B-claim
print I-claim
media I-claim
has I-claim
failed I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
its I-claim
important I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
provision I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
. O

Another O
point O
is O
that O
, O
from B-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
aspect I-premise
, I-premise
buying I-premise
newspapers I-premise
appears I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
becomes I-premise
available I-premise
for I-premise
every I-premise
one I-premise
. O

It O
is O
clear O
to O
recognize O
that O
the B-premise
internet I-premise
service I-premise
is I-premise
being I-premise
provided I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
low I-premise
cost I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
free I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

The O
question O
arises O
as O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
person O
spends O
an O
extra O
money O
buying O
newspapers O
to O
receive O
the O
same O
, O
even O
usually O
less O
information O
than O
those O
he O
can O
have O
with O
the O
internet O
? O

The B-premise
answer I-premise
, I-premise
perhaps I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
hardly I-premise
would I-premise
rational I-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
so I-premise
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the B-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
reading I-claim
newspapers I-claim
may I-claim
continue I-claim
falling I-claim
sharply I-claim
, I-claim
possibly I-claim
leading I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
close I-claim
- I-claim
downs I-claim
of I-claim
many I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
coming I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
when B-premise
taking I-premise
environment I-premise
into I-premise
consideration I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
must I-premise
conceive I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
newspapers I-premise
are I-premise
published I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
trees I-premise
are I-premise
cut I-premise
down I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
simply I-premise
the I-premise
contributor I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
deforestation I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
happening I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
today I-premise
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
newspapers B-claim
' I-claim
production I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
face I-claim
environmentalists I-claim
on I-claim
its I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
alive I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
might O
be O
unpleasant O
for O
some O
advocating O
newspapers O
to O
witness O
the O
extinction O
of O
the O
type O
of O

However O
, O

once O

out O

education O

which O

a O
civilized O
society O

plays O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
a O
country O
's O
long O
- O
lasting O
prosperity O
. O

It O
is O
no O
wonder O
that O
governments O
throughout O
the O
world O
lay O
special O
emphasis O
on O
education O
development O
. O

As O
for O
the O
two O
integral O
components O
within O
the O
system O
, O
elementary O
and O
advanced O
education O
, O
there O
's O
no O
doubt O
that O
a B-claim
government I-claim
is I-claim
supposed I-claim
to I-claim
offer I-claim
sufficient I-claim
financial I-claim
support I-claim
for I-claim
both I-claim
. O

Concerning O
that O
elementary B-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
the I-premise
base I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
architecture I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
fundamental I-premise
requirement I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
qualified I-premise
citizen I-premise
in I-premise
today I-premise
's I-premise
society I-premise
, O
government B-premise
should I-premise
guarantee I-premise
that I-premise
all I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
equal I-premise
and I-premise
convenient I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
it I-premise
. O

So O
a B-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
established I-premise
primary I-premise
education I-premise
goes I-premise
hand I-premise
in I-premise
hand I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
high I-premise
rate I-premise
of I-premise
illiteracy I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
interplay I-premise
seriously I-premise
compromises I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
future I-premise
development I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if B-claim
countries I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
the I-claim
developing I-claim
countries I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
determined I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
off I-claim
, I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
key I-claim
points I-claim
governments I-claim
should I-claim
set I-claim
on I-claim
agenda I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
educate I-claim
more I-claim
qualified I-claim
future I-claim
citizens I-claim
through I-claim
elementary I-claim
education I-claim
. O

That O
's O
not O
enough O
, O
for B-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
represent I-premise
the I-premise
cutting I-premise
edge I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise

academic I-premise
achievements I-premise
, I-premise
act I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
vanguard I-premise
in I-premise
economic I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
advance I-premise
. O

The B-premise
high I-premise
technology I-premise
and I-premise
new I-premise
ideas I-premise
applied I-premise
into I-premise
practice I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
lead I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
to I-premise
flourish I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
elevate I-premise
its I-premise
status I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
international I-premise
community I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
may I-premise
argue I-premise
that I-premise
universities I-premise
can I-premise
support I-premise
themselve I-premise
well I-premise
by I-premise
donation I-premise
or I-premise
invention I-premise
, O
but O
this B-premise
argument I-premise
is I-premise
invalid I-premise
. O

Researches B-premise
into I-premise
humanities I-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
still I-premise
need I-premise
large I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
, O
what O
's O
more O
, O
government B-claim
's I-claim
big I-claim
budget I-claim
on I-claim
universities I-claim
may I-claim
attract I-claim
more I-claim
excellent I-claim
intellectuals I-claim
and I-claim
researchers I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
country I-claim
and I-claim
enjoy I-claim
a I-claim
higher I-claim
reputation I-claim
worldwide I-claim
. O

From O
reasons O
listed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
safely O
draw O
the O
conclusion O
that O
, O
a B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
spare I-claim
effort I-claim
on I-claim
young I-claim
children I-claim
education I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
universities I-claim
, O
both B-claim
are I-claim
crucial I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
brighter I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Roommates O
quality O
and O
their O
importance O
Much O
has O
been O
said O
about O
the O
importance O
about O
good O
roommates O
and O
how O
roommates O
will O
affect O
our O
life O
in O
school O
. O

Research O
showed O
that O
friends O
that O
we O
made O
in O
university O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
life O
time O
friends O
and O
this O
especially O
applicable O
to O
roommate O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
opinion O
, O
the B-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
roommates I-claim
is I-claim
being I-claim
considered I-claim
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
communication B-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
another I-claim
essential I-claim
particularity I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
roommate I-claim
. O

Consideration B-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
important I-premise
in I-premise
relationship I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
roommate B-premise
turns I-premise
down I-premise
the I-premise
music I-premise
or I-premise
television I-premise
volume I-premise
at I-premise
night I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
what I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
done I-premise
until I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
taste I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
own I-premise
medicine I-premise
. O

At B-premise
all I-premise
times I-premise
, I-premise
think I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
's I-premise
feeling I-premise
before I-premise
doing I-premise
any I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
centered I-premise
action I-premise
would I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
roommate I-premise
relationship I-premise
tremendously I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
having B-claim
a I-claim
considered I-claim
roommate I-claim
is I-claim
significantly I-claim
imperative I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
school I-claim
life I-claim
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
prevent I-premise
conflicts I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
a I-premise
family I-premise
member I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
communication B-premise
is I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
making I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
roommate I-premise
. O

People B-premise
have I-premise
different I-premise
habit I-premise
in I-premise
daily I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
tidy I-premise
the I-premise
blanket I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
. O

One B-premise
might I-premise
think I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
piece I-premise
of I-premise
cake I-premise
while I-premise
other I-premise
would I-premise
consider I-premise
it I-premise
as I-premise
immense I-premise
project I-premise
. O

If B-premise
one I-premise
requested I-premise
to I-premise
move I-premise
out I-premise
just I-premise
because I-premise
his I-premise
roommate I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
tidy I-premise
up I-premise
the I-premise
blanket I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
crying I-premise
over I-premise
split I-premise
milk I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
communication B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
as O
it B-premise
would I-premise
clear I-premise
up I-premise
the I-premise
misinterpretation I-premise
. O

Through B-premise
communication I-premise
, I-premise
bonded I-premise
are I-premise
build I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
better I-premise
understanding I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
others I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
valuable O
factors O
about O
roommate O
that O
are O
important O
. O

Consideration B-claim
and I-claim
communication I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
personal I-claim
opinion I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
quality I-claim
. O

However O
, O
people O
might O
not O
get O
what O
they O
want O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
sky O
is O
the O
limit O
; O
there O
are O
all O
kinds O
of O
personality O
out O
there O
. O

We O
need O
to O
be O
flexible O
to O
be O
account O
into O
society O
. O

Should O
governments O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
improving O
roads O
and O
highways O
Nowadays O
transportation O
has O
attracted O
much O
social O
concern O
. O

Whether O
governments O
should O
invest O
more O
money O
in O
traffic O
infrastructure O
or O
focus O
more O
on O
developing O
public O
transportation O
has O
erupted O
endless O
controversy O
. O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
unreasonable O
to O
suggest O
that O
governments B-claim
spend I-claim
more I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
buses I-claim
, I-claim
trains I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
subways I-claim
investment I-claim
. O

Such B-premise
public I-premise
vehicles I-premise
are I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
serve I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
society I-premise
therefore O
they B-claim
help I-claim
alleviate I-claim
traffic I-claim
congestion I-claim
and I-claim
decrease I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
carbon I-claim
released I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
. O

Both O
these O
two O
things O
are O
important O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
carbon B-premise
emission I-premise
cut I-premise
is I-premise
significantly I-premise
essential I-premise
for I-premise
protecting I-premise
the I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the B-premise
more I-premise
cars I-premise
and I-premise
motorbikes I-premise
are I-premise
on I-premise
roads I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
seriously I-premise
the I-premise
ozone I-premise
layer I-premise
is I-premise
damaged I-premise
. O

If B-premise
governments I-premise
use I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
roads I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
strong I-premise
likelihood I-premise
that I-premise
more I-premise
people I-premise
drive I-premise
their I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise
work I-premise
. O

This B-claim
is I-claim
sure I-claim
to I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
more I-claim
carbon I-claim
emitted I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
atmosphere I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
cause I-claim
skin I-claim
cancer I-claim
and I-claim
destroy I-claim
the I-claim
natural I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Whereas O
, O
if B-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
good I-premise
buses I-premise
, I-premise
trains I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
subways I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
inclined I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
less I-premise
private I-premise
vehicles I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
decreases I-premise
the I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
carbon I-premise
released I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
the B-claim
policy I-claim
that I-claim
concentrates I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
developing I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
brings I-claim
an I-claim
advantageous I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
earth I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
policy I-premise
would I-premise
play I-premise
a I-premise
pivotal I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
relieving I-premise
traffic I-premise
jam I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
quiet I-premise
clear I-premise
that I-premise
traffic I-premise
congestion I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
serious I-premise
problem I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
this O
issue O
is O
that O
there B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
vehicles I-premise
flowing I-premise
on I-premise
roads I-premise
. O

In O
order O
to O
tackle O
the O
problem O
, O
governments B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
turn I-claim
people I-claim
' I-claim
attention I-claim
on I-claim
public I-claim
vehicles I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
cars I-claim
and I-claim
motorbikes I-claim
. O

There B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
possibility I-premise
that I-premise
improving I-premise
roads I-premise
and I-premise
highways I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
seem I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
the I-premise
major I-premise
cause I-premise
of I-premise
traffic I-premise
congestion I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
concede O
that O
high B-claim
- I-claim
quality I-claim
roads I-claim
and I-claim
highways I-claim
make I-claim
it I-claim
easier I-claim
to I-claim
move I-claim
around I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
public B-claim
transportation I-claim
systems I-claim
even I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

They B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
ease I-claim
traffic I-claim
jam I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
protect I-claim
the I-claim
atmosphere I-claim
. O

That O
is O
why O
many O
governments O
around O
the O
world O
invest O
more O
money O
on O
developing O
public O
transportation O
facilities O
. O

Physical O
exercise O

Although O
some O
people O
think O
that O
the O
major O
part O
of O
school O
schedule O
should O
be O
entirely O
devoted O
to O
academics O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
physical I-claim
education I-claim
part I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
outweighed I-claim
. O

Physical B-claim
exercises I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
healthy I-claim
nation I-claim
, I-claim
assist I-claim
to I-claim
learning I-claim
through I-claim
direct I-claim
observation I-claim
and I-claim
finally I-claim
aid I-claim
to I-claim
financial I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
country I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
ancient O
Latin O
proverb O
says O
: O
" O
Anima O
sana O
in O
corpore O
sano O
" O
, O
which O
means O
that O
healthy B-premise
body I-premise
is I-premise
basis I-premise
for I-premise
healthy I-premise
soul I-premise
. O

There B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
direct I-premise
linkage I-premise
between I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
frequency I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
physical I-premise
exercises I-premise
. O

The B-premise
more I-premise
we I-premise
practice I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
better I-premise
we I-premise
feel I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
improve I-premise
health I-premise
conditions I-premise
with I-premise
everyday I-premise
physical I-premise
activity I-premise
: I-premise
gradually I-premise
, I-premise
step I-premise
by I-premise
step I-premise
we I-premise
change I-premise
physical I-premise
condition I-premise
to I-premise
better I-premise
. O

So O
, O
if B-claim
the I-claim
entire I-claim
nation I-claim
, I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
school I-claim
ages I-claim
begin I-claim
going I-claim
for I-claim
sports I-claim
and I-claim
try I-claim
doing I-claim
that I-claim
everyday I-claim
, I-claim
eventually I-claim
it I-claim
may I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
healthy I-claim
nation I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
when B-claim
we I-claim
practice I-claim
outdoors I-claim
and I-claim
indoors I-claim
sports I-claim
, I-claim
many I-claim
aspects I-claim
are I-claim
getting I-claim
clearer I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
goes I-premise
jogging I-premise
everyday I-premise
, I-premise
eventually I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
his I-premise
own I-premise
body I-premise
through I-premise
direct I-premise
observation I-premise
. O

Alike O
, O
the B-premise
school I-premise
basketball I-premise
team I-premise
gains I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
succeed I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
particular I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
throwing I-premise
the I-premise
ball I-premise
into I-premise
hoot I-premise
practicing I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
learning I-premise
theoretically I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
almost B-premise
all I-premise
natural I-premise
science I-premise
discoveries I-premise
were I-premise
made I-premise
by I-premise
direct I-premise
observation I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
physical I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
financial B-claim
sustainability I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
region I-claim
mostly I-claim
depends I-claim
on I-claim
how I-claim
healthy I-claim
the I-claim
population I-claim
is I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
money I-premise
invested I-premise
into I-premise
physical I-premise
education I-premise
program I-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
allocations I-premise
into I-premise
healthcare I-premise
, O
since O
the B-premise
nation I-premise
is I-premise
comparatively I-premise
healthy I-premise
. O

Along O
with O
that O
, O
physically B-premise
healthy I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
contribute I-premise
more I-premise
both I-premise
into I-premise
economical I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
development I-premise
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
the B-premise
better I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
feels I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
better I-premise
his I-premise
brain I-premise
works I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
putting B-claim
physical I-claim
activities I-claim
in I-claim
early I-claim
steps I-claim
of I-claim
human I-claim
development I-claim
would I-claim
finally I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
mentally I-claim
healthy I-claim
society I-claim
. O

As O
hence O
it B-premise
ends I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
financially I-premise
competitive I-premise
country I-premise
. O

In O
the O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the B-claim
more I-claim
attention I-claim
is I-claim
withdrawn I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
problem I-claim
of I-claim
physical I-claim
education I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
more I-claim
influence I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
get I-claim
on I-claim
academic I-claim
success I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
. O

as I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
beneficial I-claim
results I-claim
of I-claim
modern I-claim
technology I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
, I-premise
peoples I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
deal I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
post I-premise
their I-premise
letters I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
payements I-premise
were I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
weight I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
letters I-premise
or I-premise
boxes I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
many I-premise
accidents I-premise
may I-premise
cause I-premise
problem I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
post I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
delivered I-premise
. O

But O
nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
all I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
take I-premise
advantage I-premise
of I-premise
internet I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
email I-premise
free I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
send I-premise
their I-premise
emails I-premise
to I-premise
everyone I-premise
in I-premise
no I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
besides I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
sure I-premise
if I-premise
their I-premise
emails I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
delivered I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

Another B-premise
important I-premise
aspect I-premise
on I-premise
technology I-premise
is I-premise
transferring I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Today B-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
apply I-premise
for I-premise
foreign I-premise
universities I-premise
much I-premise
easier I-premise
than I-premise
before I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
sending I-premise
email I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
using I-premise
credit I-premise
cards I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
all I-premise
necessary I-premise
fees I-premise
online I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
with B-claim
the I-claim
advent I-claim
of I-claim
internet I-claim
and I-claim
online I-claim
paying I-claim
systems I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
do I-claim
many I-claim
thing I-claim
at I-claim
your I-claim
home I-claim
easily I-claim
. O

Another B-claim
technological I-claim
innovations I-claim
which I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
is I-claim
related I-claim
to I-claim
medical I-claim
equipments I-claim
. O

Biomedical B-premise
engineers I-premise
could I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
increasing I-premise
life I-premise
expectancy I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
one B-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
inventions I-premise
was I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
artificial I-premise
heart I-premise
valves I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
count I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
turning I-premise
point I-premise
in I-premise
heart I-premise
surgeries I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
time I-premise
doctors I-premise
used I-premise
pig I-premise
heart I-premise
's I-premise
valve I-premise
to I-premise
implant I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
the I-premise
patient I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
alive I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
3 I-premise
years I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
replacement I-premise
. O

But B-premise
now I-premise
, I-premise
biomedical I-premise
engineers I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
artificial I-premise
heart I-premise
valves I-premise
which I-premise
works I-premise
well I-premise
and I-premise
doctors I-premise
can I-premise
implant I-premise
them I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
technology B-claim
has I-claim
helped I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
comfortable I-claim
life I-claim
. O

You B-claim
can I-claim
see I-claim
its I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
transportation I-claim
, I-claim
communication I-claim
, I-claim
medicine I-claim
and I-claim
so I-claim
forth I-claim
. O

Technology O
inspires O
children O
's O
creativity O
instead O
of O
weakening O
it O

Technology O
accelerates O
human O
's O
evolving O
pace O
. O

With O
advanced O
technology O
, O
many O
things O
that O
seemed O
impossible O
in O
the O
past O
, O
have O
become O
realities O
. O

For O
example O
, O
people O
in O
the O
past O
never O
dreamed O
of O
talking O
to O
anyone O
whenever O
they O
wanted O
or O
see O
someone O
overseas O
on O
a O
computer O
screen O
, O
both O
of O
these O
can O
be O
achieved O
with O
cellphone O
and O
internet O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
point O
that O
technology O
has O
made O
children O
less O
creative O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
deny O
that O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
, O
but O
I O
think O
technology B-claim
makes I-claim
children I-claim
even I-claim
more I-claim
creative I-claim
. O

First O
, O
technology B-premise
inspires I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
. O

Children B-premise
are I-premise
curious I-premise
about I-premise
everything I-premise
around I-premise
them I-premise
, O
so O
when B-premise
they I-premise
come I-premise
across I-premise
a I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
tech I-premise
product I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
cellphone I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
obsessed I-premise
with I-premise
its I-premise
mysterious I-premise
functions I-premise
and I-premise
eager I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
it I-premise
works I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Bill B-premise
Gates I-premise
was I-premise
attracted I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
original I-premise
huge I-premise
computer I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
he I-premise
did I-premise
everything I-premise
he I-premise
could I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
how I-premise
it I-premise
worked I-premise
. O

After B-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
figured I-premise
out I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
stuff I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
then I-premise
began I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
the I-premise
computer I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
successfully I-premise
invented I-premise
a I-premise
computer I-premise
that I-premise
was I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
and I-premise
lightweight I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
instead B-claim
of I-claim
interfering I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
creativity I-claim
, I-claim
technology I-claim
actually I-claim
encourages I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
technology B-premise
widen I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
were I-premise
only I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
things I-premise
from I-premise
one I-premise
perspective I-premise
. O

However O
, O
with B-premise
highly I-premise
advanced I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
information I-premise
from I-premise
foreign I-premise
countries I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
foreign I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
different I-premise
cultures I-premise
and I-premise
different I-premise
ways I-premise
of I-premise
thinking I-premise
. O

Knowledge B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
base I-premise
of I-premise
creativity I-premise
. O

The B-claim
diverse I-claim
knowledge I-claim
that I-claim
children I-claim
gained I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
parts I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
, I-claim
inspires I-claim
children I-claim
and I-claim
encourage I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
have I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
. O

Technology B-premise
has I-premise
made I-premise
life I-premise
too I-premise
easy I-premise
for I-premise
most I-premise
children I-premise
. O

In B-premise
comfortable I-premise
conditions I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
satisfied I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
around I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
refuse I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
change I-premise
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
increasingly I-premise
more I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
become I-premise
obsessed I-premise
with I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
tech I-premise
products I-premise
. O

They B-claim
kept I-claim
researching I-claim
new I-claim
technology I-claim
and I-claim
became I-claim
successful I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
young I-claim
age I-claim
. O

Lessons O
with O
teachers O
versus O
others O
sources O
Over O
the O
last O
half O
century O

the O
change O
in O
the O
life O
of O
human O
beings O
has O
increased O
beyond O
our O
wildest O
expectations O
. O

There O
are O
countless O
new O
technological O
equipments O
flooding O
into O
our O
lives O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Internet O
, O
television O
and O
cell O
phone O
. O

They O
all O
enrich O
our O
daily O
lives O
. O

Now O
, O
many O
students O
learn O
from O
Internet O
after O
class O
and O
they O
find O
it O
quite O
helpful O
. O

Many O
people O
find O
that O
students B-claim
at I-claim
schools I-claim
and I-claim
universities I-claim
still I-claim
learn I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
from I-claim
lessons I-claim
with I-claim
teachers I-claim
. O

They O
argue O
that O
teachers B-premise
teach I-premise
students I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
write I-premise
, I-premise
read I-premise
and I-premise
calculate I-premise
since I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
kindergarten I-premise
. O

And B-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
primary I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
teachers I-premise
teach I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
further I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
writing I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
using I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
teachers I-premise
that I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
with I-premise
obstacles I-premise
in I-premise
schooling I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
students B-premise
gain I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
knowledge I-premise
through I-premise
teachers I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
right I-premise
and I-premise
wrong I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
assistance I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

Those O
who O
feel O
that O
students B-claim
learn I-claim
far I-claim
more I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
sources I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
Internet I-claim
and I-claim
television I-claim
, O
firmly O
believe O
that O
within B-premise
this I-premise
sources I-premise
students I-premise
learn I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
things I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
learn I-premise
in I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
only I-premise
input I-premise
some I-premise
key I-premise
words I-premise
and I-premise
google I-premise
it I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
numberless I-premise
articles I-premise
and I-premise
websites I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
it I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
students B-premise
learn I-premise
things I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-premise
contend I-premise
that I-premise
good I-premise
television I-premise
programs I-premise
do I-premise
teach I-premise
students I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Discovery B-premise
Channel I-premise
has I-premise
many I-premise
instructive I-premise
episodes I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
have I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
others I-premise
cultures I-premise
, I-premise
outer I-premise
space I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
students B-claim
learn I-claim
far I-claim
more I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
teachers I-claim
than I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
source I-claim
. O

Because O
not O
only O
do O
teachers B-claim
teach I-claim
us I-claim
knowledge I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
the I-claim
skills I-claim
to I-claim
tell I-claim
right I-claim
from I-claim
wrong I-claim
. O

Just O
imagine O
: O
if O
a O
student O
ca O
n't O
even O
make O
out O
whether O
the O
source O
is O
reasonable O
or O
not O
, O
then O
how O
can O
he O
get O
the O
right O
information O
to O
help O
him O
to O
learn O
? O

Email O
and O
text O

written O
language O

The O
introduction O
of O
email O
and O
text O
messaging O
has O
brought O
about O
considerable O
changes O
in O
communication O
. O

With O
this O
situation O
, O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
they B-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
factors I-claim
decreasing I-claim
the I-claim
position I-claim
of I-claim
written I-claim
language I-claim
. O

I O
am O
in O
favor O
of O
that O
idea O
because O
of O
their O
advantages O
and O
the O
fact O
we O
can O
see O
today O
about O
the O
use O
of O
these O
new O
means O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
point I-claim
out I-claim
many I-claim
benefits I-claim
users I-claim
can I-claim
get I-claim
from I-claim
email I-claim
and I-claim
text I-claim
messaging I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
answers I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
question I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
great I-claim
popularity I-claim
. O

Before B-premise
email I-premise
and I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
, I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
communicated I-premise
by I-premise
meeting I-premise
directly I-premise
, I-premise
sending I-premise
letters I-premise
or I-premise
later I-premise
, I-premise
calling I-premise
from I-premise
home I-premise
phones I-premise
. O

Such B-premise
ways I-premise
usually I-premise
made I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
troubles I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
expensiveness I-premise
, I-premise
difficulties I-premise
in I-premise
far I-premise
communication I-premise
or I-premise
emergency I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
loss I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
. O

However O
, O
email B-premise
and I-premise
cell I-premise
phones I-premise
have I-premise
improved I-premise
the I-premise
obstacles I-premise
above I-premise
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
send I-premise
or I-premise
receive I-premise
electronic I-premise
letters I-premise
anywhere I-premise
and I-premise
anytime I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
. O

Especially O
, O
thanks B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
function I-premise
provided I-premise
by I-premise
email I-premise
and I-premise
text I-premise
messaging I-premise
( I-premise
SMS I-premise
) I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
cheaper I-premise
and I-premise
faster I-premise
to I-premise
transfer I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
to I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
time I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
convenient I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
population I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
them I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
traditional I-premise
ways I-premise
. O

The B-claim
popularity I-claim
of I-claim
email I-claim
and I-claim
text I-claim
messaging I-claim
, I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
result I-claim
, I-claim
leads I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
losing I-claim
of I-claim
written I-claim
language I-claim
's I-claim
position I-claim
. O

People B-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
slangs I-premise
and I-premise
abbreviated I-premise
words I-premise
to I-premise
shorten I-premise
their I-premise
writing I-premise
and I-premise
save I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
communicating I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

The O
outcome O
is O
that O
language B-premise
in I-premise
writing I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
its I-premise
original I-premise
form I-premise
. O

Even O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
people B-premise
compose I-premise
a I-premise
message I-premise
with I-premise
only I-premise
emoticons I-premise
( I-premise
the I-premise
expressions I-premise
by I-premise
face I-premise
created I-premise
by I-premise
service I-premise
providers I-premise
) I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
means I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
room I-premise
for I-premise
writing I-premise
or I-premise
typing I-premise
texts I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
dangerous I-premise
that I-premise
youngsters I-premise
sometimes I-premise
use I-premise
such I-premise
new I-premise
languages I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
studying I-premise
, I-premise
writing I-premise
assignments I-premise
. O

If B-premise
that I-premise
tendency I-premise
continues I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
rapid I-premise
pace I-premise
, I-premise
written I-premise
language I-premise
may I-premise
face I-premise
up I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
real I-premise
problem I-premise
about I-premise
its I-premise
stand I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
we B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
deny I-claim
the I-claim
threat I-claim
from I-claim
email I-claim
and I-claim
text I-claim
messaging I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
status I-claim
of I-claim
written I-claim
language I-claim
because I-claim
their I-claim
obvious I-claim
popularity I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
educators O
and O
individuals O
themselves O
, O
especially O
the O
youths O
should O
pay O
ore O
attention O
to O
this O
matter O
so O
that O
we O
can O
take O
advantages O
of O
the O
new O
language O
along O
with O
preserving O
the O
traditional O
one O
. O

Using O
animals O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
human O
beings O
With O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
the O
standard O
of O
people O

, O
increasing O
numbers O
of O

Some O
opponents O
says O
that O
it O
is O
cruel O

however O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
no O

are I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
sold I-claim
without I-claim
testing I-claim
on I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

In O
my O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
discuss O
this O
issue O
from O
twofold O
aspects O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
we O
all O
know O
, O
animals B-premise
are I-premise
friendly I-premise
and I-premise
vital I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
, O
because O
if B-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
no I-premise
animals I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
balance I-premise
of I-premise
nature I-premise
will I-premise
broke I-premise
down I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
, I-premise
human I-premise
, I-premise
will I-premise
die I-premise
out I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

The B-premise
animal I-premise
experiments I-premise
accelerate I-premise
the I-premise
vanishing I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
categories I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
doing B-claim
this I-claim
various I-claim
testing I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
hazard I-claim
of I-claim
human I-claim
's I-claim
future I-claim
and I-claim
next I-claim
generation I-claim
. O

Though O
animal B-premise
experiments I-premise
have I-premise
negative I-premise
impact I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
balance I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
necessary I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
sure I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
live I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
life I-premise
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
indisputable I-claim
that I-claim
every I-claim
new I-claim
kind I-claim
food I-claim
or I-claim
pill I-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
noxious I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
scientists I-claim
must I-claim
do I-claim
something I-claim
to I-claim
insure I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
invention I-claim
benefits I-claim
people I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
making I-claim
people I-claim
ill I-claim
or I-claim
even I-claim
dying I-claim
. O

The B-premise
new I-premise
foods I-premise
or I-premise
medicines I-premise
are I-premise
invented I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
the I-premise
quantity I-premise
of I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Thus O
even B-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
volunteers I-premise
; I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
take I-premise
the I-premise
place I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
to I-premise
test I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
foods I-premise
or I-premise
medicines I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
potentially I-premise
harm I-premise
for I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
testing I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
reaffirm O
that O
although O
there B-claim
is I-claim
some I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
of I-claim
animals I-claim
' I-claim
profits I-claim
, O
the B-claim
merits I-claim
of I-claim
animal I-claim
experiments I-claim
still I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
demerits I-claim
. O

Television O
is O
the O
culprit O
for O
destroying O
communication O
between O
friends O
& O
family O

It O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
home O
that O
does O
not O
have O
a O
television O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
number O
of O
television O
channels O
and O
programs O
are O
increasing O
everyday O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
most B-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
plan I-claim
for I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
limitation I-claim
or I-claim
schedule I-claim
for I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
. O

I O
agree O
with O
that O
idea O
that O
television B-claim
devastate I-claim
families I-claim
ties I-claim
. O

In B-claim
spite I-claim
of I-claim
enjoying I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
shows I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
really I-claim
time I-claim
consuming I-claim
task I-claim
. O

Emergence B-premise
of I-premise
new I-premise
television I-premise
channels I-premise
or I-premise
shows I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
surprising I-premise
. O

We B-premise
kill I-premise
time I-premise
by I-premise
tracking I-premise
these I-premise
channels I-premise
so I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
day I-premise
we I-premise
understand I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
late I-premise
for I-premise
doing I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
that I-premise
suffers I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
us I-premise
everyday I-premise
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
call I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
parents I-premise
or I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
I O
think O
watching B-claim
television I-claim
programs I-claim
makes I-claim
us I-claim
lazy I-claim
. O

We B-premise
usually I-premise
spend I-premise
our I-premise
times I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
television I-premise
for I-premise
at I-premise
least I-premise
three I-premise
ours I-premise
a I-premise
day I-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise
come I-premise
back I-premise
home I-premise
after I-premise
eight I-premise
- I-premise
hour I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
office I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
we B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
for I-premise
healthy I-premise
activity I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
gym I-premise
or I-premise
doing I-premise
other I-premise
sports I-premise
. O

This B-premise
makes I-premise
us I-premise
a I-premise
lazy I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
prefers I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
sedentary I-premise
activities I-premise
like I-premise
watching I-premise
television I-premise
shows I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
be I-premise
active I-premise
and I-premise
sociable I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
some B-claim
television I-claim
programs I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
effect I-claim
on I-claim
viewers I-claim
. O

Some B-premise
thriller I-premise
or I-premise
action I-premise
movies I-premise
advertise I-premise
negative I-premise
activities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
doing I-premise
criminal I-premise
activity I-premise
. O

These B-premise
genre I-premise
of I-premise
programs I-premise
has I-premise
more I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
teenagers I-premise
. O

They B-premise
usually I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
mimic I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
see I-premise
on I-premise
movies I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
daily I-premise
behaviors I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
killing B-claim
our I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
making I-claim
us I-claim
lazy I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
advertising I-claim
negative I-claim
behaviors I-claim
are I-claim
just I-claim
only I-claim
few I-claim
reasons I-claim
to I-claim
show I-claim
how I-claim
television I-claim
is I-claim
destructive I-claim
. O

I O
think O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
global I-claim
problem I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
this I-claim
problem I-claim

and I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
need I-claim
global I-claim
contribution I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
solution I-claim
. O

Gender O
Equality O
at O
university O
admission O

Nowadays O
men O
and O
women O
are O
equally O
participating O
in O
every O
field O
. O

Contrastingly O
, O
in O
the O
past O
time O
, O
women O
worked O
at O
home O
and O
performed O
sophisticated O
work O
. O

This O
factor O
is O
still O
affecting O
thinking O
of O
many O
people O
. O

They O
still O
believe O
that O
in O
present O
time O
women O
must O
do O
such O
type O
of O
work O
only O
. O

This O
tendency O
enforces O
universities O
to O
accept O
student O
according O
to O
the O
gender O
. O

Universities B-claim
should I-claim
accept I-claim
equal I-claim
numbers I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
of I-claim
both I-claim
genders I-claim
. O

Initially O
, O
if O
we O
look O
into O
the O
fact O
, O
women B-premise
have I-premise
proved I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
field I-premise
whether I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
indoor I-premise
or I-premise
outdoor I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays B-premise
women I-premise
are I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
home I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
sky I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
acting I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
housewife I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
flying I-premise
planes I-premise
also I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
university B-premise
authority I-premise
must I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
biased I-premise
on I-premise
ground I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
gender I-premise
discrimination I-premise
. O

They B-premise
must I-premise
consider I-premise
the I-premise
academic I-premise
record I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
student I-premise
as I-premise
main I-premise
criteria I-premise
of I-premise
admission I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
current I-premise
job I-premise
market I-premise
affects I-premise
the I-premise
decision I-premise
of I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
university I-premise
designs I-premise
its I-premise
courses I-premise
according I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
need I-premise
of I-premise
employers I-premise
. O

The B-premise
job I-premise
selection I-premise
criteria I-premise
are I-premise
pre I-premise
decided I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
employers B-premise
need I-premise
male I-premise
candidates I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
heavy I-premise
work I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
repairing I-premise
and I-premise
installation I-premise
of I-premise
heavy I-premise
machine I-premise
. O

They B-premise
prefer I-premise
male I-premise
staff I-premise
for I-premise
night I-premise
shifts I-premise
. O

They B-premise
want I-premise
female I-premise
candidates I-premise
for I-premise
soft I-premise
natured I-premise
work I-premise
like I-premise
counseling I-premise
, I-premise
teaching I-premise
, I-premise
designing I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
universities B-claim
follow I-claim
the I-claim
requirement I-claim
of I-claim
job I-claim
providers I-claim
and I-claim
decide I-claim
subject I-claim
suitable I-claim
for I-claim
particular I-claim
gender I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
universities B-claim
must I-claim
open I-claim
choice I-claim
for I-claim
everyone I-claim
to I-claim
select I-claim
his I-claim
subject I-claim
. O

Our B-premise
youth I-premise
has I-premise
become I-premise
very I-premise
confident I-premise
towards I-premise
his I-premise
career I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
ready I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
bound I-premise
in I-premise
certain I-premise
limitations I-premise
. O

Female B-premise
candidates I-premise
also I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
care I-premise
about I-premise
any I-premise
restriction I-premise
posed I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
employer I-premise
. O

So O
we B-claim
must I-claim
give I-claim
them I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
their I-claim
goal I-claim
. O

Some O
young O
adults O
want O
independence O
from O
their O
parents O
quickly O
Many O
young O
adults O
want O
to O
get O
away O
from O
their O
parent O
's O
houses O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
have O
no O
limits O
, O
to O
be O
independent O
. O

But O
these O
young O
people O
do O
not O
take O
into O
account O
that O
their B-claim
lives I-claim
are I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
difficult I-claim
, I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
away I-claim
from I-claim
home I-claim
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
bills I-premise
, O
because O
they B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
lodging I-premise
or I-premise
at I-premise
least I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
where I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
less I-premise
expenses I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
tenant I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
like I-premise
. O

Living B-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
houses I-claim
will I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
adults I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
live I-premise
separate I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
loan I-premise
, I-premise
electricity I-premise
, I-premise
water I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
meal I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
still I-premise
study I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
combine I-premise
studying I-premise
with I-premise
working I-premise
, O
because O
they B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
everything I-premise
. O

There B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
such I-premise
worries I-premise
when I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
home I-premise
, O
because O
parents B-premise
will I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents B-premise
will I-premise
give I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
money I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
they I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
only I-premise
on I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

Another B-claim
problem I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
adults I-claim
may I-claim
encounter I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
tenant I-claim
, I-claim
who I-claim
they I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
like I-claim
. O

His B-premise
habits I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
totally I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
theirs I-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
behavior I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
inappropriate I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
with I-premise
him I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
share I-premise
a I-premise
room I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
less I-premise
expenses I-premise
. O

Living B-premise
with I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
problem I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
. O

When B-premise
the I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
tenant I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
share I-premise
their I-premise
interests I-premise
and I-premise
points I-premise
of I-premise
view I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
ask I-premise
him I-premise
for I-premise
advice I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
most I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
quarrel I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
reckon O
that O
for B-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
adults I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
, O
because O
of O
the O
benefits O
they O
will O
have O
. O

They B-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
worry I-claim
about I-claim
financial I-claim
problems I-claim
or I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
get I-claim
on I-claim
well I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
roommate I-claim
. O

Air O
pollution O
Air O
pollution O
is O
an O
issue O
threatening O
the O
environment O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
such O
as O
causing O
holes O
in O
the O
ozone O
and O
affecting O
global O
heating O
in O
the O
negative O
way O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
more B-claim
responsibilities I-claim
should I-claim
put I-claim
on I-claim
private I-claim
individuals I-claim
and I-claim
companies I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
paying I-claim
to I-claim
clean I-claim
up I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
. O

First O
, O
in B-premise
most I-premise
industrialized I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
companies I-premise
that I-premise
holds I-premise
heavy I-premise
factories I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
constitutions I-premise
. O

The B-premise
waste I-premise
products I-premise
and I-premise
harmful I-premise
gases I-premise
produced I-premise
by I-premise
these I-premise
factories I-premise
cause I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

While B-premise
these I-premise
companies I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
businesses I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
considering I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
precautions I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

If B-claim
these I-claim
companies I-claim
were I-claim
obliged I-claim
to I-claim
pay I-claim
to I-claim
clean I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
would I-claim
at I-claim
least I-claim
make I-claim
an I-claim
effort I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
they I-claim
cause I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
private B-premise
individuals I-premise
cause I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
in I-premise
several I-premise
ways I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
inessential I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
cars I-premise
and I-premise
house I-premise
heating I-premise
. O

As B-premise
house I-premise
heating I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
need I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
winter I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
households I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
consider I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
filters I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
pollution I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
heating I-premise
causes I-premise
. O

Instead O
of O
this O
, O
some B-premise
expensive I-premise
vehicles I-premise
cause I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
by B-claim
charging I-claim
private I-claim
individuals I-claim
for I-claim
causing I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
, I-claim
that I-claim
will I-claim
at I-claim
least I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
pollution I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
restrict I-claim
the I-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
products I-claim
that I-claim
cause I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
for I-claim
both I-claim
individuals I-claim
and I-claim
companies I-claim
. O

Governments B-claim
also I-claim
should I-claim
use I-claim
an I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
budgets I-claim
to I-claim
clean I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
, I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
putting I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
responsibility I-claim
to I-claim
companies I-claim
and I-claim
private I-claim
individuals I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
governments B-claim
are I-claim
responsible I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
environment I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
inhabitants I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
responsible I-claim
from I-claim
cleaning I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
, O
both B-claim
companies I-claim
and I-claim
private I-claim
individuals I-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
the I-claim
main I-claim
part I-claim
to I-claim
clean I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim

Young O
people O
should O
go O

university O
or O
not O
Persistent O
deliberation O
is O
happening O
as O
to O
whether O
it O
is O
desirable O
for O
the O
youth O
to O
go O
to O
university O
. O

In O
regard O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
students O
to O
get O
high O
quality O
of O
education O
in O
universities O
, O
while O
others O
think O
that O
it O
is O
only O
one O
of O
causes O
to O
increase O
the O
rate O
of O
unemployment O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
analyze O
both O
views O
first O
in O
order O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
fool O
- O
proof O
decision O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
those O
who O
advocate O
the O
impracticability O
of O
university O
have O
several O
reasons O
. O

From O
their O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
there B-premise
are I-premise
numerous I-premise
job I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
certification I-premise
of I-premise
university I-premise
graduation I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
mechanics I-premise
, I-premise
sales I-premise
persons I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
engineers I-premise
, O
and O
, O
furthermore O
, O
labors B-premise
for I-premise
graduates I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
short I-premise
supply I-premise
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
the B-premise
labor I-premise
market I-premise
for I-premise
highly I-premise
educated I-premise
students I-premise
is I-premise
now I-premise
too I-premise
competitive I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
after I-premise
finishing I-premise
their I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

In O
this O
regard O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
loss I-claim
of I-claim
national I-claim
productivity I-claim
that I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
spend I-claim
much I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
searching I-claim
for I-claim
high I-claim
salary I-claim
jobs I-claim
, I-claim
even I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
sheer I-claim
time I-claim
- I-claim
consuming I-claim
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
are O
voices O
in O
the O
opposition O
, O
saying O
that O
universities B-claim
provide I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
skills I-claim
for I-claim
careers I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
academic I-claim
knowledge I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
human I-claim
race I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
bio I-claim
science I-claim
, I-claim
politics I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
medicine I-claim
. O

These B-premise
academic I-premise
values I-premise
are I-premise
necessary I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
progress I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
many B-premise
researches I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
ivory I-premise
- I-premise
tower I-premise
have I-premise
created I-premise
ingenious I-premise
discoveries I-premise
and I-premise
achievements I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
society I-premise
. O

Another O
significant O
factor O
of O
universities O
is O
that O
diverse B-premise
experiences I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
campus I-premise
life I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
generation I-premise
more I-premise
competently I-premise
because O
there B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
chances I-premise
through I-premise
internships I-premise
, I-premise
deeper I-premise
discussion I-premise
, I-premise
independent I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
exchange I-premise
scholarships I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
both O
contentions O
about O
the O
necessity O
of O
universities O
' O
education O
have O
reasonable O
justifications O
; O
however O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
view O
. O

Although O
higher B-claim
education I-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
guarantee I-claim
young I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
success I-claim
, O
the B-claim
benefits I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
in I-claim
universities I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
vital I-claim
factor I-claim
in I-claim
creating I-claim
more I-claim
possibilities I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
society I-claim
through I-claim
advancing I-claim
academic I-claim
fulfillment I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
generation I-claim
who I-claim
have I-claim
experiences I-claim

. O

Effects O
of O
mobile O
phones O
Nowadays O
, O
the O
popularity O
of O
mobile O
phones O
has O
brought O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
convenience O
but O
at O
the O
meanwhile O
a O
variety O
of O
problems O
as O
well O
, O
such O
as O
social O
, O
medical O
and O
technical O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
think I-claim
these I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
will I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
advantages I-claim
brought I-claim
by I-claim
cell I-claim
phones I-claim
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
analyze O
these O
three O
issues O
in O
order O
to O
support O
my O
viewpoint O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
almost B-claim
everything I-claim
that I-claim
changed I-claim
our I-claim
lifestyle I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
will I-claim
also I-claim
cause I-claim
some I-claim
social I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

Mobile O
phones O
are O
not O
out O
of O
expectation O
. O

Speaking B-premise
loudly I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
phone I-premise
in I-premise
public I-premise
areas I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
libraries I-premise
and I-premise
hospitals I-premise
appears I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
very I-premise
impolite I-premise
and I-premise
offensive I-premise
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
some B-premise
students I-premise
utilize I-premise
their I-premise
cell I-premise
phones I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
effective I-premise
cheating I-premise
tools I-premise
in I-premise
examinations I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
send I-premise
and I-premise
receive I-premise
answers I-premise
by I-premise
texting I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
impossible I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
these I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
some I-premise
regulations I-premise
and I-premise
rules I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
effectively I-premise
implemented I-premise
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
some B-claim
harmful I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
our I-claim
health I-claim
are I-claim
lethal I-claim
. O

It B-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
proved I-premise
that I-premise
overusing I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
electronic I-premise
devices I-premise
including I-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
could I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
higher I-premise
possibility I-premise
of I-premise
suffering I-premise
hearing I-premise
loss I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
cancers I-premise
, I-premise
although I-premise
the I-premise
further I-premise
investigation I-premise
are I-premise
needed I-premise
. O

Another O
debatable O
problem O
is O
about O
techniques O
. O

There B-claim
is I-claim
panic I-claim
among I-claim
people I-claim
that I-claim
their I-claim
conversation I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
intercepted I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
third I-claim
party I-claim
. O

This B-premise
possibility I-premise
exists I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
. O

But O
a B-premise
more I-premise
efficient I-premise
and I-premise
reliable I-premise
system I-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
be I-premise
invented I-premise
to I-premise
guarantee I-premise
the I-premise
private I-premise
information I-premise
of I-premise
users I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-claim
mobile I-claim
phone I-claim
has I-claim
become I-claim
a I-claim
dispensable I-claim
multifunctional I-claim
tools I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
daily I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
used I-premise
for I-premise
communication I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
it I-premise
also I-premise
functions I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
Internet I-premise
browser I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
music I-premise
player I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
personal I-premise
organizer I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
forth I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
overused O
without O
side O
effects O
. O

The B-claim
contribution I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
mobile I-claim
phone I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
is I-claim
prominent I-claim
and I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
dependence I-claim
on I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
irreversible I-claim
, O
although O
it B-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
problems I-claim
that I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
well I-claim
handled I-claim
. O

Computer O
has O
negative O
effects O
to O
children O
Nowadays O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
development O
of O
technology O
, O
computer O
is O
now O
indispensable O
to O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
children O
and O
it O
should O
be O
used O
daily O
by O
children O
but O
some O
others O
think O
differently O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
latter O
opinion O
is O
true O
. O

First O
, O
using B-claim
computer I-claim
constantly I-claim
has I-claim
bad I-claim
influence I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
eyes I-claim
. O

When B-premise
they I-premise
concentrate I-premise
on I-premise
computer I-premise
for I-premise
too I-premise
long I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
eyes I-premise
will I-premise
get I-premise
tired I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
main I-premise
reason I-premise
for I-premise
some I-premise
eyes I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
typically I-premise
shortsighted I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
children B-premise
who I-premise
play I-premise
games I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
on I-premise
computer I-premise
can I-premise
seriously I-premise
lack I-premise
communicating I-premise
skills I-premise
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
know I-premise
little I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
outside I-premise
life I-premise
. O

It O
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
that O
people B-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
addicted I-claim
to I-claim
games I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
online I-claim
games I-claim
, I-claim
can I-claim
eventually I-claim
bear I-claim
dangerous I-claim
consequences I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
several B-premise
teenagers I-premise
play I-premise
games I-premise
without I-premise
rest I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
health I-premise
depression I-premise
, O
a B-premise
typical I-premise
example I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
death I-premise
of I-premise
Korean I-premise
gamer I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
stop I-premise
playing I-premise
for I-premise
3 I-premise
days I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
even B-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
interested I-claim
in I-claim
online I-claim
game I-claim
can I-claim
still I-claim
be I-claim
negatively I-claim
affected I-claim
by I-claim
using I-claim
computer I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
. O

Some B-premise
social I-premise
surveys I-premise
have I-premise
shown I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
children I-premise
use I-premise
computer I-premise
for I-premise
studying I-premise
purpose I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
attracted I-premise
by I-premise
facebook I-premise
, I-premise
blog I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. I-premise
instead I-premise
. O

Due O
to O
this O
neglect O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
bad I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
because O
when B-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
live I-premise
without I-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
it B-claim
is I-claim
undeniable I-claim
that I-claim
computer I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
crucial I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
human I-claim
life I-claim
, O
it B-claim
still I-claim
has I-claim
its I-claim
bad I-claim
side I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
. O

People O
should O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
properly O
to O
make O
it O
an O
effective O
tool O
because O
computer O
should O
be O
used O
not O
only O
for O
entertaining O
but O
also O
for O
working O
and O
studying O
purpose O
. O

Influence O
of O
large O
factories O
Nowadays O
, O
whether O
to O
establish O
large O
factories O
nearby O
housing O
areas O
has O
become O
a O
controversial O
issue O
in O
our O
society O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
case O
of O
economic O
development O
, O
industrial O
buildings O
are O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
modern O
society O
. O

However O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
people O
are O
against O
building O
a O
factory O
near O
their O
community O
because O
of O
pollution O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
building I-claim
a I-claim
factory I-claim
will I-claim
outweigh I-claim
its I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
, I-claim
if I-claim
we I-claim
tackle I-claim
the I-claim
environmental I-claim
problems I-claim
brought I-claim
by I-claim
factories I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a B-claim
large I-claim
factory I-claim
can I-claim
stimulate I-claim
local I-claim
economic I-claim
growth I-claim
and I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
unemployment I-claim
rate I-claim
. O

To B-premise
manufacture I-premise
goods I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
demand I-premise
of I-premise
laborers I-premise
, I-premise
from I-premise
which I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
residents I-premise
can I-premise
benefit I-premise
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
the B-premise
factory I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
isolated I-premise
, I-premise
other I-premise
industries I-premise
and I-premise
business I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
quickly I-premise
established I-premise
, I-premise
resulting I-premise
in I-premise
economic I-premise
growth I-premise
of I-premise
local I-premise
area I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
estate I-premise
industry I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
boosted I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
satisfy I-premise
the I-premise
workers I-premise
' I-premise
accommodation I-premise
need I-premise
. O

The B-claim
main I-claim
disadvantage I-claim
is I-claim
contamination I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
true I-premise
that I-premise
some I-premise
area I-premise
are I-premise
suffering I-premise
the I-premise
dire I-premise
consequences I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
overdeveloping I-premise
the I-premise
industry I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
water I-premise
pollution I-premise
, I-premise
overcrowded I-premise
traffic I-premise
and I-premise
medical I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
some I-premise
industrial I-premise
cities I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
workers I-premise
are I-premise
suffering I-premise
various I-premise
breathing I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
asthma I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
waste I-premise
ashes I-premise
and I-premise
certain I-premise
chemical I-premise
substances I-premise
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
inevitable I-premise
that I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
factories I-premise
built I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
society I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
how B-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
of I-claim
building I-claim
a I-claim
factory I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
than I-claim
whether I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
it I-claim
. O

In O
fact O
most B-premise
problems I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
avoidable I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
factories I-premise
put I-premise
in I-premise
real I-premise
and I-premise
great I-premise
effort I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
their I-premise
waste I-premise
well I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
installation O
of O
manufacturing O
plant O
is O
a O
trend O
of O
industrialization O
for O
many O
countries O
. O

Its O
advantages O

Prepared O
Food O

Nowadays O
, O
more O
and O
more O
people O
begin O
to O
select O
prepared O
food O
as O
their O
daily O
meals O
, O
since O
it B-claim
can I-claim
effectively I-claim
save I-claim
time I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
considered I-claim
as I-claim
money I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
. O

However O
it B-claim
is I-claim
obvious I-claim
that I-claim
prepared I-claim
food I-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
about I-claim
some I-claim
negative I-claim
influence I-claim
result I-claim
from I-claim
utilizing I-claim
the I-claim
artificial I-claim
ingredients I-claim
, I-claim
ignoring I-claim
the I-claim
nutrition I-claim
of I-claim
food I-claim
and I-claim
modifying I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
eating I-claim
habits I-claim
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
explain O
why O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
based O
on O
the O
three O
reasons O
above O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
to B-premise
make I-premise
their I-premise
food I-premise
easier I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
and I-premise
taste I-premise
delicious I-premise
, I-premise
almost I-premise
every I-premise
producer I-premise
adds I-premise
a I-premise
wide I-premise
range I-premise
of I-premise
artificial I-premise
ingredients I-premise
in I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
food I-premise
that I-premise
is I-premise
now I-premise
purchased I-premise
by I-premise
most I-premise
people I-premise
. O

Some O
ingredients B-premise
being I-premise
added I-premise
have I-premise
caused I-premise
dire I-premise
consequences I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
usually I-premise
some I-premise
articles I-premise
in I-premise
newspapers I-premise
and I-premise
magazines I-premise
which I-premise
report I-premise
the I-premise
relationship I-premise
between I-premise
certain I-premise
chemical I-premise
components I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
food I-premise
and I-premise
diseases I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
easy B-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim
- I-claim
cook I-claim
foods I-claim
sometimes I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
dangerous I-claim
for I-claim
human I-claim
's I-claim
health I-claim
. O

Not B-claim
cooking I-claim
fresh I-claim
food I-claim
will I-claim
also I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
lack I-claim
of I-claim
nutrition I-claim
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
cooking O
prepared O
food O
needs O
much O
less O
time O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
fresh O
food O
. O

Whereas B-premise
some I-premise
research I-premise
has I-premise
apparently I-premise
demonstrated I-premise
that I-premise
prepared I-premise
food I-premise
is I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
enough I-premise
nutrients I-premise
we I-premise
need I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
growing I-premise
up I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
cooking O
is O
one O
of O
arts O
humans O
create O
. O

The B-claim
more I-claim
prepared I-claim
food I-claim
we I-claim
eat I-claim
the I-claim
more I-claim
cooking I-claim
skills I-claim
we I-claim
lose I-claim
. O

At B-premise
the I-premise
increasing I-premise
living I-premise
pace I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
choose I-premise
microwave I-premise
as I-premise
their I-premise
unique I-premise
cooker I-premise
that I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
prepare I-premise
a I-premise
dish I-premise
in I-premise
five I-premise
minutes I-premise
. O

But O
rare B-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
aware I-premise
that I-premise
this I-premise
has I-premise
contributed I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
modification I-premise
of I-premise
cooking I-premise
habits I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
may I-premise
cause I-premise
the I-premise
loss I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
custom I-premise
and I-premise
culture I-premise
about I-premise
cooking I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
the B-claim
invention I-claim
of I-claim
prepared I-claim
foods I-claim
definitely I-claim
satisfies I-claim
the I-claim
demand I-claim
of I-claim
some I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
busy I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
work I-claim
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
thing I-claim
. O

Cooking O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
, O
contrarily O
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
for O
our O
health O
and O
culture O
. O

Financial O
aid O
to O
develop O
countries O
As O
is O
commonly O
understood O
, O
there O
is O
an O
increasingly O
gap O
between O
developed O
countries O
and O
developing O
countries O
. O

It O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
developed O
countries O
and O
organization O
are O
proving O
financial O
assistance O
to O
the O
impoverished O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
disagreed I-claim
that I-claim
this I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
and I-claim
only I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
assist I-claim
developing I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
analyzing O
the O
necessity O
of O
developing O
their O
education O
and O
the O
real O
objective O
of O
supporters O
. O

Firstly O
, O
education B-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
essential I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
development I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
most B-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
are I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
educational I-premise
resources I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
experienced I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
evaluation I-premise
systems I-premise
and I-premise
teaching I-premise
facilities I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
usually I-premise
neglected I-premise
by I-premise
local I-premise
authorities I-premise
. O

From O
this O
example O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
if B-claim
the I-claim
developed I-claim
countries I-claim
are I-claim
unwilling I-claim
to I-claim
share I-claim
their I-claim
successful I-claim
experience I-claim
in I-claim
education I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
developing I-claim
countries I-claim
will I-claim
remain I-claim
undeveloped I-claim
, I-claim
even I-claim
though I-claim
they I-claim
gain I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
deal I-claim
of I-claim
economic I-claim
support I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-premise
critical I-premise
method I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
condition I-premise
of I-premise
poor I-premise
countries I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
build I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
complete I-premise
educational I-premise
system I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
financial I-premise
aid I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
well O
acknowledged O
that O
there O
is O
no O
free O
lunch O
in O
the O
world O
. O

This O
means O
some B-premise
powerful I-premise
countries I-premise
provide I-premise
financial I-premise
support I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
to I-premise
exploit I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
resources I-premise
and I-premise
target I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
labour I-premise
market I-premise
. O

Indeed O
, O
they B-premise
rarely I-premise
provide I-premise
local I-premise
residents I-premise
with I-premise
any I-premise
technological I-premise
aid I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
cause I-premise
contamination I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
developing B-claim
countries I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
totally I-claim
depend I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
financial I-claim
support I-claim
from I-claim
powerful I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
financial B-claim
aid I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
only I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
assist I-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

And O
it B-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
proven I-claim
that I-claim
developing I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
improving I-claim
national I-claim
technology I-claim
and I-claim
science I-claim
level I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
path I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
undergo I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
really I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
alter I-claim
current I-claim
situation I-claim
. O

Society O
should O
ban O
all O
forms O
of O
the O
advertising O

It O
is O
no O
secret O
that O
advertising O
become O
inseparable O
part O
of O
our O
modern O
life O
. O

We O
come O
across O
with O
ads O
almost O
everywhere O
and O
everyday O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
companies O
by O
advertising O
their O
goods O
or O
services O
spend O
their O
money O
for O
nothing O
. O

Other O
critics O
say O
that O
ads O
have O
no O
purpose O
, O
they O
only O
cause O
damages O
to O
society O
and O
all O
forms O
of O
advertising O
should O
be O
banned O
. O

On O
my O
part O
I O
would O
like O
to O
solve O
this O
issue O
on O
a O
different O
way O
. O

Society B-claim
does I-claim
need I-claim
an I-claim
advertising I-claim
but I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
our I-claim
responsibility I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
the I-claim
content I-claim
and I-claim
what I-claim
kind I-claim
of I-claim
goods I-claim
and I-claim
services I-claim
we I-claim
would I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
offer I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
customers I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
do O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
advertising B-claim
alcohol I-claim
, I-claim
cigarettes I-claim
, I-claim
goods I-claim
and I-claim
services I-claim
with I-claim
adult I-claim
content I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
prohibited I-claim
because O
these B-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
ads I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
negative I-premise
effect I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Youngsters B-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
tempted I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
cigarettes I-premise
or I-premise
alcohol I-premise
and I-premise
later I-premise
to I-premise
start I-premise
consume I-premise
it I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
daily I-premise
basis I-premise
. O

Fortunately O
, O
some B-premise
countries I-premise
take I-premise
this I-premise
issue I-premise
seriously I-premise
and I-premise
advertising I-premise
alcohol I-premise
, I-premise
cigarettes I-premise
and I-premise
materials I-premise
with I-premise
adult I-premise
content I-premise
is I-premise
banned I-premise
on I-premise
those I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
by B-claim
advertising I-claim
companies I-claim
, I-claim
businesses I-claim
, I-claim
firms I-claim
and I-claim
individuals I-claim
promote I-claim
their I-claim
goods I-claim
and I-claim
services I-claim
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
ads I-premise
we I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
new I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
compare I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
choose I-premise
what I-premise
’s I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
. O

These B-claim
days I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
many I-claim
businesses I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
governments I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
rely I-claim
on I-claim
advertising I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
tourism B-premise
makes I-premise
up I-premise
one I-premise
- I-premise
third I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
Czech I-premise
Republic I-premise
's I-premise
economy I-premise
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
attractions I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
Czech I-premise
government I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
advertise I-premise
and I-premise
sell I-premise
its I-premise
services I-premise
to I-premise
foreign I-premise
consumers I-premise
. O

Only B-premise
well I-premise
planned I-premise
and I-premise
well I-premise
targeted I-premise
advertising I-premise
will I-premise
bring I-premise
more I-premise
foreign I-premise
tourists I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
modern B-claim
society I-claim
needs I-claim
advertising I-claim
. O

Ads B-claim
will I-claim
keep I-claim
us I-claim
well I-claim
informed I-claim
about I-claim
new I-claim
products I-claim
and I-claim
services I-claim
, O
but O
we O
should O
also O
bear O
in O
mind O
that O
advertising B-claim
cigarettes I-claim
and I-claim
alcohol I-claim
will I-claim
definitely I-claim
affect I-claim
our I-claim
children I-claim
in I-claim
negative I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Do O
married O
women O
usually O
work O
? O

Why O
and O
why O
not O
? O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
married B-claim
women I-claim
nowadays I-claim
have I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
up I-claim
jobs I-claim
like I-claim
men I-claim
when I-claim
employment I-claim
discrimination I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
gender I-claim
have I-claim
been I-claim
erased I-claim
significantly I-claim
. O

Working B-claim
outside I-claim
home I-claim
will I-claim
bring I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
benefits I-claim
to I-claim
both I-claim
married I-claim
woman I-claim
and I-claim
their I-claim
household I-claim
. O

I O
will O
mention O
some O
basic O
reasons O
as O
following O
. O

Firstly O
, O
extra B-premise
income I-premise
that I-premise
women I-premise
earn I-premise
will I-premise
contribute I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
's I-premise
expenses I-premise
. O

By B-premise
taking I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
wife I-premise
can I-premise
earn I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
her I-premise
family I-premise
life I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
really I-premise
necessary I-premise
in I-premise
cases I-premise
of I-premise
her I-premise
husband I-premise
's I-premise
low I-premise
salary I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
difficulty I-premise
of I-premise
getting I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
job I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
present I-premise
. O

So O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
normal I-claim
practice I-claim
for I-claim
women I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
helpmates I-claim
in I-claim
earning I-claim
money I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
working B-premise
outside I-premise
the I-premise
house I-premise
creates I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
married I-premise
women I-premise
to I-premise
contact I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
outer I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
strengthen I-premise
their I-premise
character I-premise
and I-premise
show I-premise
their I-premise
capacity I-premise
. O

These B-premise
things I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
confident I-premise
, I-premise
independent I-premise
. O

These B-premise
women I-premise
will I-premise
set I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
example I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
doubt I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
play I-claim
roles I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
mother I-claim
and I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
wife I-claim
better I-claim
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
nowadays O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
supporting I-claim
conditions I-claim
that I-claim
help I-claim
women I-claim
balance I-claim
housework I-claim
and I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Besides B-premise
the I-premise
gorvernment I-premise
's I-premise
policies I-premise
on I-premise
limited I-premise
families I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
husbands I-premise
' I-premise
sharing I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
housework I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
employers I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
offer I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
for I-premise
women I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim
organized I-claim
home I-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
need I-claim
the I-claim
housewife I-claim
's I-claim
presence I-claim
the I-claim
whole I-claim
day I-claim
long I-claim
and O
married B-claim
women I-claim
could I-claim
go I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
enjoy I-claim
the I-claim
working I-claim
life I-claim
outside I-claim
the I-claim
home I-claim
. O

Government O
and O
education O
Primary O
and O
secondary O
education O
provide O
a O
basic O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
to O
the O
people O
in O
this O
world O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
that O
government B-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
those I-claim
education I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
people I-claim
; I-claim
however I-claim
, I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
more I-claim
higher I-claim
education I-claim
like I-claim
university I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
or I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
fees I-claim
. O

Some B-claim
parents I-claim
might I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
enough I-claim
money I-claim
to I-claim
pay I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
university I-claim
fees I-claim
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
think I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
fair I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
paying I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
primary I-claim
and I-claim
secondary I-claim
education I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
education I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
all I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
could I-premise
receive I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
students B-premise
that I-premise
already I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
basic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
education I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
studies I-premise
when I-premise
their I-premise
parent I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
it I-premise
. O

They B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
responsible I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
studies I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
pay I-claim
the I-claim
fees I-claim
themselves I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
to O
that O
, O
the B-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
independent I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
build I-premise
their I-premise
characters I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
marketplace I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
this B-claim
will I-claim
encourage I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
parents I-claim
to I-claim
think I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
more I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
as O
they B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
some I-premise
contribution I-premise
too I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
future I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
completely O
agree O
that O
government B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
pay I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
fees I-claim
because O
this B-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim
both I-claim
the I-claim
parents I-claim
and I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
charge I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
themselves I-claim
not I-claim
just I-claim
depend I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
all I-claim
their I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Alternative O
forms O
of O
transport O
to O
alleviate O
traffic O
congestion O

Recently O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
means O
of O
transportation O
. O

Some O
state O
that O
automobile O
is O
the O
most O
convenient O
transportation O
, O
while O
others O
assert O
that O
alternative O
forms O
of O
transport O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
view O
of O
environmental O
pollution O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
alternative B-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
transportation I-claim
and I-claim
international I-claim
laws I-claim
in I-claim
controlling I-claim
automobiles I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
introduced I-claim
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
several O
reasons O
will O
be O
described O
carefully O
in O
the O
following O
passages O
. O

Firstly O
, O
an B-premise
increase I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
automobiles I-premise
brings I-premise
about I-premise
environmental I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

Since O
automobile B-premise
exhaust I-premise
and I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxides I-premise
emission I-premise
have I-premise
bad I-premise
impacts I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
, O
the B-premise
air I-premise
gets I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
polluted I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
causes I-premise
respiratory I-premise
disease I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
inhabitants I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
crucial I-claim
to I-claim
alter I-claim
automobiles I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
transportation I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
legislate I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
automobiles I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
an B-premise
increase I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
automobiles I-premise
causes I-premise
terrible I-premise
traffic I-premise
congestion I-premise
. O

Once B-premise
we I-premise
get I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
traffic I-premise
jam I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
forces I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
waste I-premise
our I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
while I-premise
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
traffic B-premise
congestion I-premise
irritates I-premise
drivers I-premise
and I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
result I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
an I-premise
increase I-premise
of I-premise
traffic I-premise
accidents I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
methods I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
automobiles I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
car I-claim
ownership I-claim
and I-claim
use I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
immediately I-claim
planned I-claim
and I-claim
implemented I-claim
. O

In O
order O
to O
solve O
these O
problems O
, O
alternative B-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim
transportation I-claim
and I-claim
international I-claim
laws I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
automobiles I-claim
ownership I-claim
and I-claim
use I-claim
can I-claim
work I-claim
effectively I-claim
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
former O
, O
alternative B-premise
forms I-premise
which I-premise
emit I-premise
less I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxides I-premise
and I-premise
gasses I-premise
than I-premise
automobiles I-premise
are I-premise
ideal I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
rental B-premise
bicycle I-premise
system I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
introduced I-premise
in I-premise
several I-premise
European I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

This B-premise
system I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
corner I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
district I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
rental I-premise
bicycles I-premise
are I-premise
placed I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
ride I-premise
it I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
districts I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
fee I-premise
. O

Since O
bicycle B-premise
expels I-premise
neither I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxides I-premise
nor I-premise
harmful I-premise
gasses I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
form I-premise
to I-premise
protect I-premise
environment I-premise
than I-premise
automobile I-premise
. O

As O
for O
the O
latter O
point O
, O
the B-premise
introduction I-premise
of I-premise
international I-premise
laws I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
also I-premise
effective I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
some I-premise
regulations I-premise
to I-premise
limit I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
automobiles I-premise
by I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
allow I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
possess I-premise
one I-premise
car I-premise
only I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
these B-premise
attempts I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
automobiles I-premise
can I-premise
ease I-premise
traffic I-premise
congestion I-premise
and I-premise
environmental I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

In O
summary O
, O
even O
though O
some B-claim
people I-claim
claim I-claim
the I-claim
convenience I-claim
of I-claim
automobile I-claim
, O
I O
would O
state O
that O
alternative B-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim
transport I-claim
and I-claim
international I-claim
laws I-claim
on I-claim
controlling I-claim
automobiles I-claim
are I-claim
necessary I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
environmental I-claim
protection I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
alleviation I-claim
of I-claim
traffic I-claim
congestion I-claim
. O

Giving O
aid O
to O
poorer O
countries O
has O
more O
negative O
effects O
than O
positive O
effect O

In O
this O
world O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
does O
not O
know O
this O
world O
' O
globalization O
' O
, O
which O

more O
closer O

and O
every O
single O
countries O
affects O
each O
other O
more O
than O
before O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

That O
is O
why O
governmental O
and O
non O
- O
governmental O
organizations O
have O
been O
focus O
on O
being O
harmony O
and O
contribute O
to O
aid O
to O
poor O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
just B-claim
giving I-claim
aid I-claim
to I-claim
impoverished I-claim
countries I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
manipulated I-claim
by I-claim
big I-claim
power I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-claim
great I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
materials I-claim
and I-claim
money I-claim
have I-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
being I-claim
corrupted I-claim
and I-claim
politically I-claim
dependent I-claim
on I-claim
other I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

However O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
aiding B-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
has I-claim
positive I-claim
effects I-claim
, I-claim
overweighing I-claim
its I-claim
side I-claim
- I-claim
effects I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
several I-claim
reasons I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
poor B-premise
counties I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
shortage I-premise
of I-premise
basic I-premise
materials I-premise
and I-premise
facilities I-premise
to I-premise
start I-premise
businesses I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
it I-premise
richer I-premise
. O

To B-premise
be I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
poverty I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
fundamental I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
basic I-premise
industry I-premise
related I-premise
factors I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
light I-premise
, I-premise
electricity I-premise
, I-premise
load I-premise
, I-premise
highways I-premise
, I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
, I-premise
technology I-premise
and I-premise
buildings I-premise
for I-premise
companies I-premise
. O

Aiding B-claim
help I-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
in I-claim
this I-claim
situation I-claim
solve I-claim
their I-claim
economical I-claim
problems I-claim
and I-claim
run I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
business I-claim
. O

In O
actual O
, O
republic B-premise
of I-premise
Korea I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
poorest I-premise
country I-premise
even I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
others I-premise
in I-premise
Africa I-premise
in I-premise
1960 I-premise
's I-premise
. O

Now B-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
has I-premise
became I-premise
strong I-premise
economy I-premise
country I-premise
aiding I-premise
poor I-premise
countries I-premise
after I-premise
10 I-premise
years I-premise
of I-premise
aid I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
counties I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
aiding B-claim
campaign I-claim
gives I-claim
a I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
considerate I-claim
about I-claim
poor I-claim
people I-claim
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
rich I-premise
countries I-premise
ponder I-premise
poor I-premise
people I-premise
suffering I-premise
from I-premise
poverty I-premise
and I-premise
diseases I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
never I-premise
take I-premise
their I-premise
abundance I-premise
for I-premise
granted I-premise
. O

It B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
raises I-premise
the I-premise
notice I-premise
the I-premise
meaning I-premise
of I-premise
harmony I-premise
and I-premise
love I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
humane I-premise
doctrine I-premise
of I-premise
globalization I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
the B-claim
campaigns I-claim
might I-claim
include I-claim
practical I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

In B-premise
globalized I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
economies I-premise
of I-premise
several I-premise
countries I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
network I-premise
and I-premise
must I-premise
influence I-premise
on I-premise
each I-premise
others I-premise
. O

When B-premise
America I-premise
mortgage I-premise
loan I-premise
system I-premise
went I-premise
bad I-premise
, I-premise
several I-premise
economies I-premise
of I-premise
European I-premise
and I-premise
Asian I-premise
countries I-premise
fluctuated I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
any I-premise
countries I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
gotten I-premise
international I-premise
supports I-premise
to I-premise
block I-premise
its I-premise
bankrupt I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
abovementioned I-claim
three I-claim
key I-claim
points I-claim
of I-claim
positive I-claim
effects I-claim
of I-claim
aid I-claim
; I-claim
supporting I-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
its I-claim
economy I-claim
strong I-claim
and I-claim
building I-claim
humane I-claim
concepts I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
keeping I-claim
strong I-claim
global I-claim
economy I-claim
. O

I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
being B-claim
a I-claim
global I-claim
neighbor I-claim
by I-claim
aiding I-claim
poor I-claim
countries I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
continues I-claim
by I-claim
many I-claim
organizations I-claim
and I-claim
volunteers I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim

Effects O

During O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world O

every O

its O

Globalization O
as O
a O
gradual O

Although O
it O

the O

; O
it O

side O

make O
it O
a O
controversial O

Some B-claim
people I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
recognize I-claim
globalization I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
threat I-claim
to I-claim
ethnic I-claim
and I-claim
religious I-claim
values I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
country I-claim
. O

They O
think O
that O
the B-premise
idea I-premise
of I-premise
globalization I-premise
put I-premise
their I-premise
inherited I-premise
culture I-premise
in I-premise
danger I-premise
of I-premise
uncontrolled I-premise
change I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
vulnerable I-premise
against I-premise
the I-premise
attack I-premise
of I-premise
imperialistic I-premise
governments I-premise
. O

Those O
who O
disagree O

believe O
that O
globalization B-claim
contribute I-claim
effectively I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
global I-claim
improvement I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
aspects I-claim
. O

Developing B-premise
globalization I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
many I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
increasing I-premise
the I-premise
pace I-premise
of I-premise
scientific I-premise
and I-premise
economic I-premise
promotions I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
entire I-premise
world I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they B-premise
admit I-premise
that I-premise
globalization I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
considered I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
country I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
their I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
through I-premise
the I-premise
stuffs I-premise
and I-premise
services I-premise
imported I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
proponents O
of O
globalization O
idea O
point O
out O
globalization B-claim
results I-claim
in I-claim
considerable I-claim
decrease I-claim
in I-claim
global I-claim
tension I-claim
due O
to O
convergence B-premise
of I-premise
benefits I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
natural I-premise
consequence I-premise
of I-premise
globalization I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
rather I-claim
classify I-claim
myself I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
proponents I-claim
of I-claim
globalization I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
speeding I-claim
factor I-claim
of I-claim
global I-claim
progress I-claim
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
solve O
the O
problems O
of O
the O
world O
rather O
than O
intensifying O
them O
. O

Study O
at O
school O
or O
get O
a O
job O
? O

Many O
people O
believe O
that O
children O
should O
study O
at O
school O
to O
have O
more O
knowledge O
that O
prepare O
better O
for O
their O
future O
. O

Others O
, O
however O
, O
think O
that O
these O
children O
may O
disrupt O
their O
school O
work O
and O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
leave O
school O
early O
to O
find O
a O
job O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
point O
of O
view O
that O
student B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
forced I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
at I-claim
school I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
schools B-premise
offer I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
environment I-premise
with I-premise
experienced I-premise
professors I-premise
and I-premise
high I-premise
quality I-premise
programs I-premise
for I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

It B-premise
creates I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
conditions I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
education I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
force I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
school I-premise
work I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
wasting I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
useless I-premise
things I-premise
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
schools B-premise
provide I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
academic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
may I-premise
learn I-premise
professional I-premise
skills I-premise
, I-premise
expand I-premise
their I-premise
understandings I-premise
and I-premise
gain I-premise
experiences I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
opprotunities I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
successful I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
employer B-premise
always I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
hire I-premise
an I-premise
employee I-premise
of I-premise
high I-premise
degree I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
professional I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
not O
unreasonable O
that O
some O
people O
think O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
interrupt I-claim
their I-claim
school I-claim
work I-claim
and I-claim
get I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
. O

Whether B-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
subjects I-premise
that I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
of I-premise
little I-premise
value I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
children B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
experiences I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
obtained I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Working B-premise
helps I-premise
children I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
independent I-premise
and I-premise

the I-premise

. O

Overall O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
students B-claim
should I-claim
study I-claim
at I-claim
school I-claim
. O

Even O
though O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
leaving I-claim
school I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
, O
studying B-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
choice I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
future I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
ways I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
train I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
independent I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
getting I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

High O
sales O
reflect O
power O
of O
advertising O
and O
not O
the O
real O
need O

Nowadays O
, O
we O
can O
see O
advertisements O
everywhere O
, O
from O
television O
set O
to O
posters O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
these B-claim
various I-claim
advertisements I-claim
get I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
buy I-claim
products I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
unnecessary I-claim
and I-claim
only I-claim
look I-claim
good I-claim
on I-claim
television I-claim
. O

I O
tend O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

To B-premise
boost I-premise
their I-premise
sales I-premise
and I-premise
win I-premise
over I-premise
customers I-premise
, I-premise
companies I-premise
pour I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
into I-premise
advertising I-premise
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
function I-claim
or I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
commodities I-claim
themselves I-claim

but I-claim
really I-claim
the I-claim
promotion I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
good I-claim
feeling I-claim
of I-claim
possessing I-claim
the I-claim
product I-claim
. O

By O
which O
I O
mean O
, O
huge B-premise
cooperation I-premise
hire I-premise
celebrities I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
face I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
product I-premise
. O

By B-premise
casting I-premise
famous I-premise
singers I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
television I-premise
advertisement I-premise
, I-premise
motorcycles I-premise
or I-premise
clothes I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
sales I-premise
increase I-premise
significantly I-premise
since O
youngsters B-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
target I-premise
consumers I-premise
, I-premise
love I-premise
celebrities I-premise
. O

Since O
having B-premise
these I-premise
products I-premise
shows I-premise
their I-premise
status I-premise
, O
the B-premise
quality I-premise
obviously I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
relatively I-premise
important I-premise
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
advertisements B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
falseful I-premise
and I-premise
exaggerated I-premise
, O
it O
is O
also O
true O
that O
it B-claim
plays I-claim
and I-claim
important I-claim
role I-claim
economically I-claim
. O

They B-premise
introduce I-premise
new I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
provide I-premise
various I-premise
choices I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
mention I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
visually I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
, O
since O
they B-premise
aim I-premise
to I-premise
grab I-premise
your I-premise
attention I-premise
. O

Advertising B-premise
also I-premise
helps I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
prices I-premise
at I-premise
reasonable I-premise
levels I-premise
, I-premise
creates I-premise
a I-premise
fair I-premise
environment I-premise
for I-premise
commercial I-premise
competition I-premise
. O

Otherwise B-premise
the I-premise
market I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
monopolistic I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
price I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
choice I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
so I-premise
selective I-premise
. O

The B-claim
power I-claim
of I-claim
advertising I-claim
maybe I-claim
over I-claim
- I-claim
rated I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
deny I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
final I-claim
decision I-claim
is I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
hands I-claim
of I-claim
us I-claim
consumers I-claim
. O

No O
matter O
how O
appealing O
the O
advertisements O
are O
, O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
on O
our O
own O
. O

Gun O
control O
Gun O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
kind O
of O
normal O
good O
in O
our O
society O
, O
which O
is O
strictly O
controlled O
in O
most O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
gun O
control O
in O
some O
countries O
is O
relatively O
loose O
than O
others O
. O

Therefore O
, O
this O
is O
still O
a O
controversial O
topic O
around O
the O
world O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
sensible I-claim
to I-claim
enforce I-claim
the I-claim
gun I-claim
control I-claim
. O

The O
first O
factor O
considered O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
accidents O
with O
guns O
. O

The B-premise
accidents I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
completely I-premise
avoided I-premise
although I-premise
only I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
gun I-premise
licenses I-premise
can I-premise
purchase I-premise
guns I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
we B-premise
hear I-premise
some I-premise
news I-premise
from I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
time I-premise
that I-premise
someone I-premise
was I-premise
hurt I-premise
by I-premise
accident I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
hunting I-premise
. O

So O
the B-claim
fewer I-claim
guns I-claim
possessed I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
fewer I-claim
accidents I-claim
would I-claim
happened I-claim
, I-claim
our I-claim
surroundings I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
safer I-claim
with I-claim
lower I-claim
accident I-claim
rates I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
most B-claim
violent I-claim
crimes I-claim
are I-claim
related I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
abuse I-claim
of I-claim
guns I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
countries I-claim
where I-claim
guns I-claim
are I-claim
available I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Eventually O
, O
guns B-premise
will I-premise
create I-premise
a I-premise
violent I-premise
society I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
trend I-premise
continues I-premise
. O

Take O
an O
example O
, O
in B-premise
American I-premise
, I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
juveniles I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
guns I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
tragedies I-premise
of I-premise
school I-premise
gun I-premise
shooting I-premise
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
some B-premise
terrorists I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
possess I-premise
more I-premise
advanced I-premise
weapons I-premise
than I-premise
the I-premise
police I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
citizens I-premise
always I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
danger I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
the B-claim
possession I-claim
of I-claim
guns I-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
raise I-claim
the I-claim
rates I-claim
of I-claim
suicide I-claim
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
US I-premise
, I-premise
firearms I-premise
remain I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
common I-premise
method I-premise
of I-premise
suicide I-premise
, I-premise
accounting I-premise
for I-premise
about I-premise
50 I-premise
per I-premise
cent I-premise
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
increasing I-premise
trend I-premise
of I-premise
adolescent I-premise
suicides I-premise
and I-premise
suicides I-premise
among I-premise
those I-premise
age I-premise
75 I-premise
and I-premise
over I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
considering B-claim
the I-claim
rise I-claim
in I-claim
accident I-claim
rates I-claim
, I-claim
violent I-claim
crime I-claim
rates I-claim
and I-claim
suicide I-claim
rates I-claim
, O
I O
support O
that O
the B-claim
guns I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
strictly I-claim
limited I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
enforce I-claim
a I-claim
series I-claim
of I-claim
laws I-claim
to I-claim
prevent I-claim
our I-claim
societies I-claim
from I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

International O
sporting O
occasions O

international O

International O
sporting O
events O
are O
a O
good O
change O

create O
a O
multi O

nation O

the O
same O
passion O
. O

It O
will O
help O
people O
around O
the O

understand O
each O

more O
. O

Since O
, O
international B-claim
sporting I-claim
occasions I-claim
are I-claim
essential I-claim
in I-claim
easing I-claim
international I-claim
tensions I-claim
and I-claim
releasing I-claim
patriotic I-claim
emotions I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
safe I-claim
way I-claim
. O

An B-premise
international I-premise
sporting I-premise
event I-premise
is I-premise
normal I-premise
held I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
with I-premise
huge I-premise
interest I-premise
from I-premise
fans I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

For B-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
of I-premise
occasions I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
regardless I-premise
of I-premise
nationality I-premise
, I-premise
origin I-premise
and I-premise
religion I-premise
will I-premise
live I-premise
together I-premise
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
more I-premise
about I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
useful I-premise
to I-premise
ease I-premise
tensions I-premise
between I-premise
nations I-premise
. O

For O
example O
in B-premise
FIFA I-premise
World I-premise
Cup I-premise
2010 I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
relation I-premise
between I-premise
North I-premise
Korea I-premise
and I-premise
South I-premise
Korea I-premise
is I-premise
dangerous I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
warship I-premise
sinking I-premise
. O

The B-premise
world I-premise
suspected I-premise
North I-premise
Korea I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
aggressive I-premise
action I-premise
. O

However O
, O
due B-premise
to I-premise
this I-premise
event I-premise
North I-premise
Korea I-premise
showed I-premise
a I-premise
friendship I-premise
and I-premise
enthuasism I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
rare I-premise
times I-premise
when I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
this I-premise
country I-premise
. O

It B-claim
really I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
alleviate I-claim
the I-claim
tension I-claim
. O

Besides O
easing O
tensions O
, O
an B-claim
international I-claim
sporting I-claim
event I-claim
also I-claim
helps I-claim
fans I-claim
release I-claim
patriotic I-claim
emotions I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
safe I-claim
way I-claim
. O

When B-premise
they I-premise
garther I-premise
together I-premise
to I-premise
encourage I-premise
their I-premise
team I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
show I-premise
their I-premise
patriotic I-premise
emotions I-premise
. O

Regardless B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
competition I-premise
between I-premise
teams I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
emotions I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
released I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
safe I-premise
way I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
sole I-premise
passion I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
sport I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
all B-premise
fans I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
sport I-premise
event I-premise
will I-premise
attract I-premise
the I-premise
attention I-premise
of I-premise
whole I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
public I-premise
media I-premise
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
a I-premise
beautiful I-premise
image I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
land I-premise
and I-premise
people I-premise
. O

In B-premise
Olympic I-premise
Beijing I-premise
2008 I-premise
, I-premise
Chinese I-premise
tried I-premise
thier I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
bring I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
a I-premise
spectacular I-premise
image I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
foreigners B-premise
came I-premise
here I-premise
always I-premise
received I-premise
the I-premise
support I-premise
of I-premise
friendly I-premise
volunteers I-premise
who I-premise
were I-premise
young I-premise
students I-premise
. O

They B-premise
were I-premise
welcomed I-premise
by I-premise
each I-premise
Chinese I-premise
hospitality I-premise

beauty I-premise
in I-premise
each I-premise

Everythings B-premise
is I-premise
created I-premise
by I-premise
patriotic I-premise
emotions I-premise

wanted I-premise
to I-premise
bring I-premise
a I-premise
beautiful I-premise
China I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
International B-claim
sporting I-claim
events I-claim
will I-claim
draw I-claim
the I-claim
international I-claim
concern I-claim
. O

It B-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
more I-claim
peaceful I-claim
by I-claim

Technology O
that O
widen O
the O
gap O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
? O

Technology O
, O
in O
the O
past O
two O
hundred O
years O
, O
has O
taken O
a O
dramatic O
progress O
in O
many O
fields O
of O
our O
society O
, O
such O
as O
telecommunications O
, O
manufacturing O
and O
buildings O
, O
etc O
. O

Certainly O
, O
technologies O
have O
also O
contributed O
to O
the O
great O
change O
of O
our O
daily O
lives O
. O

However O
, O
today O
some O
people O
consider O
that O
the O
range O
of O
technology O
regarding O
of O
public O
has O
a O
negative O
effect O
on O
increasing O
the O
gap O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
by O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

In O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
progress I-premise
of I-premise
material I-premise
technology I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
sharp I-premise
fall I-premise
of I-premise
price I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
products I-premise
. O

About B-premise
ten I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
, I-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
ware I-premise
very I-premise
expensive I-premise
for I-premise
most I-premise
members I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
of I-premise
rich I-premise
individuals I-premise
have I-premise
enough I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
one I-premise
. O

Today B-premise
, I-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
common I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
household I-premise
items I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
cheaper I-premise
materials I-premise
and I-premise
better I-premise
producing I-premise
technologies I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
most B-claim
members I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
society I-claim
can I-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
consequences I-claim
of I-claim
technical I-claim
advancements I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
the I-claim
poor I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
technical B-claim
developments I-claim
improve I-claim
productivity I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
escape I-claim
from I-claim
daily I-claim
chores I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
invest I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
energy I-claim
in I-claim
studying I-claim
and I-claim
living I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
meaningful I-claim
life I-claim
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
Internet I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
enjoy I-premise
the I-premise
pleasure I-premise
and I-premise
conveniences I-premise
which I-premise
it I-premise
brings I-premise
about I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
. O

In O
the O
past O
time O
, O
we B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
searching I-premise
information I-premise
and I-premise
waiting I-premise
for I-premise
letters I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
friends I-premise
who I-premise
lived I-premise
far I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
us I-premise
. O

Nowadays O
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
talk I-premise
with I-premise
our I-premise
friends I-premise
online I-premise
, I-premise
no I-premise
matter I-premise
where I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
and I-premise
how I-premise
far I-premise
between I-premise
us I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
Internet I-premise
gives I-premise
everyone I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
information I-premise
, O
this B-premise
therefore I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
greater I-premise
equality I-premise
between I-premise
individuals I-premise
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
everything O
has O
two O
sides O
and O
technology O
is O
not O
an O
exception O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
the B-claim
gap I-claim
between I-claim
rich I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
poor I-claim
is I-claim
widen I-claim
by I-claim
technology I-claim
, O
because O
only B-premise
the I-premise
rich I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
afford I-premise
the I-premise
expensive I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
tech I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
these I-premise
products I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
earn I-premise
more I-premise
in I-premise
return I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
think O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
limp I-premise
opposition I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
remarkable I-premise
advantages I-premise
of I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
technology I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
root I-premise
cause I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
gap I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
good I-claim
technology I-claim
bringing I-claim
to I-claim
us I-claim
is I-claim
undeniable I-claim
. O

Under B-claim
proper I-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
technology I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
human I-claim
being I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
benefit I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
and I-claim
perpetually I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
advancement I-claim
of I-claim
it I-claim
. O

Why O
should O
human O
beings O
travel O
to O
outer O
space O
? O

For O
many O
centuries O
, O
outer O
space O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
favourable O
realms O
of O
study O
. O

Space O
expeditions O
have O
been O
launched O
and O
many O
have O
been O
successful O
. O

However O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
still O
consider O
space O
exploration O
as O
an O
act O
of O
wasting O
money O
, O
to O
illustrate O
, O
astronauts O
only O
brought O
useless O
rocks O
back O
to O
planet O
earth O
despite O
the O
large O
sum O
of O
money O
spent O
on O
their O
equipment O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
reasons I-claim
for I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
to I-claim
travel I-claim
to I-claim
outer I-claim
space I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
many B-claim
facts I-claim
about I-claim
solar I-claim
system I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
discovered I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
picture I-premise
of I-premise
planet I-premise
earth I-premise
proved I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
earth I-premise
is I-premise
round I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
flat I-premise
. O

Another O
example O
is O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
earth I-premise
which I-premise
goes I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
sun I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
vice I-premise
versa I-premise
. O

If B-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
space I-premise
exploration I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
would I-premise
never I-premise
know I-premise
these I-premise
facts I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
people B-claim
can I-claim
know I-claim
more I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
planet I-claim
earth I-claim
itself I-claim
. O

By B-premise
observing I-premise
planet I-premise
earth I-premise
from I-premise
outer I-premise
space I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
find I-premise
out I-premise
ample I-premise
things I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
planet I-premise
earth I-premise
. O

With B-premise
this I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
on I-premise
something I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
earth I-premise
hazards I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
a B-claim
great I-claim
deal I-claim
of I-claim
sophisticated I-claim
technology I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
invented I-claim
. O

As B-premise
astronauts I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
to I-premise
outer I-premise
space I-premise
which I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
any I-premise
oxygen I-premise
to I-premise
breathe I-premise
in I-premise
, I-premise
scientists I-premise
are I-premise
compelled I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
research I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
oxygen I-premise
tanks I-premise
. O

Oxygen B-premise
tanks I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
proved I-premise
useful I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
outer I-premise
space I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
underwater I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
spaceships B-premise
, I-premise
communication I-premise
satellites I-premise
and I-premise
space I-premise
pens I-premise
also I-premise
contribute I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

As O
a O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
human B-claim
beings I-claim
should I-claim
travel I-claim
to I-claim
outer I-claim
space I-claim
. O

In O
spite O
of O
costing O
a O
fortune O
, O
space O
exploration O
has O
given O
aforementioned O
benefits O
. O

Benefits O
of O
students O
doing O
extra O
jobs O

In O
present O
day O
and O
age O
, O
students O
are O
normally O
exposed O
to O
extra O
jobs O
as O
early O
as O
they O
start O
their O
university O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
, O
although O
in O
some O
extents O
, O
are O
proved O
to O
have O
negative O
effects O
, O
I O
feel O
strongly O
that O
the O
disadvantages O
are O
far O
outweighed O
by O
the O
advantages O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
some O
of O
the O
benefits O
surrounding O
this O
matter O
will O
be O
carefully O
explained O
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
undoubtedly I-premise
certain I-premise
that I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
gain I-premise
their I-premise
practical I-premise
experience I-premise
by I-premise
getting I-premise
involved I-premise
extra I-premise
jobs I-premise
. O

Part B-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
furnish I-premise
them I-premise
with I-premise
precious I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
practice I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
learning I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
that B-premise
seems I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
essential I-premise
the I-premise
present I-premise
shortage I-premise
of I-premise
sufficiently I-premise
practical I-premise
conditions I-premise
supplied I-premise
in I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students B-premise
who I-premise
get I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
have I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
academic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
hands I-premise
- I-premise
on I-premise
experience I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
having B-claim
experienced I-claim
in I-claim
working I-claim
environment I-claim
during I-claim
student I-claim
time I-claim
offers I-claim
a I-claim
distinct I-claim
advantage I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
apply I-claim
for I-claim
jobs I-claim
after I-claim
their I-claim
graduation I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
students B-claim
who I-claim
take I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
are I-claim
often I-claim
more I-claim
confident I-claim
and I-claim
independent I-claim
than I-claim
other I-claim
ones I-claim
. O

By B-premise
constant I-premise
communicating I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
colleagues I-premise
daily I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
company I-premise
environment I-premise
where I-premise
their I-premise
new I-premise
ideas I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
raised I-premise
without I-premise
hesitation I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
confidence I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
significantly I-premise
gained I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
working B-premise
conditions I-premise
require I-premise
students I-premise
the I-premise
independency I-premise
in I-premise
thinking I-premise
, I-premise
working I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
solving I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
greatly I-premise
helpful I-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
characteristic I-premise
is I-premise
applied I-premise
to I-premise
tackle I-premise
subjects I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
doing B-claim
extra I-claim
jobs I-claim
helps I-claim
student I-claim
with I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
accommodation I-claim
. O

Indeed O
, O
high B-premise
studying I-premise
tuition I-premise
, I-premise
added I-premise
with I-premise
raising I-premise
accommodation I-premise
expenses I-premise
are I-premise
becoming I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
burden I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
money I-premise
they I-premise
earn I-premise
from I-premise
extra I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
normally I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
much I-premise
, I-premise
those I-premise
difficulties I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
partially I-premise
solved I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
that B-claim
helps I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
being I-claim
reliant I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
families I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim
prepared I-claim
condition I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
independent I-claim
later I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
feel O
certain O
that O
having B-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
during I-claim
your I-claim
student I-claim
time I-claim
will I-claim
offer I-claim
students I-claim
many I-claim
clear I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

By B-claim
taking I-claim
on I-claim
an I-claim
extra I-claim
job I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
partly I-claim
alleviate I-claim
some I-claim
their I-claim
problematic I-claim
matters I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
working I-claim
experience I-claim
, I-claim
confidence I-claim
and I-claim
accommodation I-claim
. O

It O
is O
my O
belief O
the O
tendency O
of O
getting O
extra O
jobs O
will O
increase O
more O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Benefits O
of O
students O
' O
unpaid O
work O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
essay O
is O
to O
discuss O
what O
can O
students O
and O
the O
organizations O
benefit O
from O
the O
activity O
that O
the O
students O
sent O
by O
their O
schools O
to O
work O
for O
companies O
without O
salaries O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
start O
by O
analyzing O
the O
advantages O
for O
doing O
this O
for O
both O
students O
and O
companies O
, O
and O
then O
I O
would O
draw O
a O
conclusion O
at O
the O
end O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
students B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
invaluable I-claim
experiences I-claim
through I-claim
the I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
working I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
institutions I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
assigned I-claim
to I-claim
. O

In B-premise
most I-premise
school I-premise
curriculums I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
courses I-premise
are I-premise
theoretical I-premise
and I-premise
often I-premise
by I-premise
instructors I-premise
speaking I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
sitting I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
classroom I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students B-premise
might I-premise
have I-premise
little I-premise
idea I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
challenges I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
true I-premise
situation I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
enter I-premise
the I-premise
workforce I-premise
after I-premise
graduation I-premise
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the B-premise
internship I-premise
, I-premise
although I-premise
without I-premise
pay I-premise
, I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
the I-premise
experiences I-premise
that I-premise
money I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
buy I-premise
. O

As B-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
companies I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
unpaid I-premise
interns I-premise
can I-premise
no I-premise
doubt I-premise
save I-premise
some I-premise
money I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
younger I-premise
generations I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
generate I-premise
new I-premise
ideas I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
bound I-premise
to I-premise
restricted I-premise
workload I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
greater I-premise
imagination I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
essentially I-premise
helpful I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
making I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
advertisement I-premise
or I-premise
slogan I-premise
. O

Moreover O
they B-premise
can I-premise
start I-premise
looking I-premise
for I-premise
potential I-premise
employees I-premise
and I-premise
begin I-premise
the I-premise
training I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
companies B-claim
save I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
resources I-claim
for I-claim
searching I-claim
new I-claim
staffs I-claim
and I-claim
organizing I-claim
an I-claim
orientation I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
students B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
outside I-claim
the I-claim
textbook I-claim
and I-claim
classroom I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
real I-claim
working I-claim
experiences I-claim
that I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
opportunity I-claim
for I-claim
future I-claim
job I-claim
consideration I-claim
whereas I-claim
organizations I-claim
earn I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
save I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
money I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
be I-claim
enlightened I-claim
by I-claim
what I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
say I-claim
. O

Sporting O
events O
easing O
international O
tensions O
, O
releasing O
patriotic O
feelings O
For O
most O
folks O
on O
Earth O
, O
the O
need O
to O
gather O
in O
one O
place O
, O
and O
enjoy O
competition O
with O
other O
talented O
people O
from O
different O
cultures O
through O
popular O
games O
has O
always O
been O
a O
strong O
motivation O
. O

This O
trend O
is O
so O
deeply O
engraved O
in O
people O
's O
mind O
that O
the O
organisation O
of O
such O
events O
continue O
to O
be O
planned O
, O
even O
when O
some O
participants O
are O
facing O
grievous O
social O
problems O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
large B-claim
scale I-claim
sports I-claim
games I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
attractive I-claim
contests I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
international I-claim
disputes I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
being I-claim
proud I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
nation I-claim
. O

This O
will O
be O
proved O
by O
analysing O
how O
sports O
events O
may O
be O
an O
important O
link O
to O
the O
peace O
, O
and O
by O
how O
they O
encourage O
people O
to O
display O
their O
national O
symbols O
. O

Firstly O
, O
during B-premise
times I-premise
of I-premise
war I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
badly I-premise
affected I-premise
countries I-premise
can I-premise
forget I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
gloomy I-premise
environment I-premise
and I-premise
maintain I-premise
a I-premise
link I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
rest I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
by I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
international I-premise
sports I-premise
event I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
Irak I-premise
was I-premise
hardly I-premise
struck I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
Second I-premise
Gulf I-premise
War I-premise
, I-premise
its I-premise
citizens I-premise
tried I-premise
to I-premise
catch I-premise
any I-premise
incoming I-premise
news I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
FootballWorld I-premise
Cup I-premise
through I-premise
their I-premise
portable I-premise
receivers I-premise
. O

This O
clearly O
shows O
that O
international B-premise
sports I-premise
competitions I-premise
encourage I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
put I-premise
pressure I-premise
on I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
come I-premise
back I-premise
, I-premise
sooner I-premise
or I-premise
later I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
relative I-premise
peaceful I-premise
normality I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
world B-claim
sports I-claim
events I-claim
strongly I-claim
participate I-claim
in I-claim
eventually I-claim
pulling I-claim
back I-claim
people I-claim
towards I-claim
friendship I-claim
and I-claim
peace I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
these B-premise
sporting I-premise
occasions I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
opportunity I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
proud I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when B-premise
the I-premise
Football I-premise
World I-premise
Cup I-premise
was I-premise
organised I-premise
in I-premise
South I-premise
Africa I-premise
, I-premise
its I-premise
citizens I-premise
filled I-premise
up I-premise
the I-premise
stadiums I-premise
, I-premise
cheered I-premise
and I-premise
waved I-premise
national I-premise
flags I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
their I-premise
national I-premise
team I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
field I-premise
. O

South B-premise
African I-premise
national I-premise
and I-premise
traditional I-premise
songs I-premise
were I-premise
played I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
streets I-premise
throughout I-premise
the I-premise
night I-premise
. O

This B-premise
example I-premise
demonstrates I-premise
how I-premise
people I-premise
might I-premise
take I-premise
numerous I-premise
elements I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
roots I-premise
and I-premise
history I-premise
to I-premise
proudly I-premise
display I-premise
them I-premise
while I-premise
supporting I-premise
their I-premise
team I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
clear I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
freely I-claim
express I-claim
their I-claim
patriotic I-claim
feelings I-claim
during I-claim
international I-claim
sports I-claim
events I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
after O
analysing O
the O
effects O
of O
world O
games O
both O
for O
countries O
at O
war O
and O
for O
organising O
countries O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
clear I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
constitute I-claim
a I-claim
tremendous I-claim
appeal I-claim
towards I-claim
a I-claim
peaceful I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
guide I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
demonstrations I-claim
of I-claim
national I-claim
proudness I-claim
. O

This B-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
true I-claim
for I-claim
centuries I-claim
and I-claim
will I-claim
certainly I-claim
not I-claim
change I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
foreseeable I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Government O
should O
make O
more O
effort O
to O
promote O
alternative O
sources O
of O
energy O

The O
increasing O
population O
and O
the O
technological O
advancements O
demand O
more O
energy O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
there O
are O
various O
other O
resources O
such O
as O
the O
nuclear O
and O
solar O
which O
are O
abundant O
and O
eco O
- O
friendly O
. O

I O
will O
analyze O
these O
areas O
in O
the O
essay O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-premise
major I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
today I-premise
is I-premise
water I-premise
. O

Although O
there B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
water I-premise
shortage I-premise
to I-premise
generate I-premise
electricity I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
still I-premise
rely I-premise
only I-premise
on I-premise
this I-premise
source I-premise
. O

To B-premise
generate I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise
vast I-premise
energy I-premise
the I-premise
fundamental I-premise
resources I-premise
are I-premise
falling I-premise
short I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
during B-premise
summer I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
power I-premise
cut I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
India I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
encourage I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
nuclear I-premise
, I-premise
solar I-premise
or I-premise
wind I-premise
energy I-premise
there I-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
any I-premise
problem I-premise
in I-premise
distributing I-premise
the I-premise
required I-premise
amount I-premise
electricity I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
implication I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
to I-claim
generate I-claim
electricity I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
available I-claim
sources I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
sources I-claim
most I-claim
widely I-claim
used I-claim
currently I-claim
to I-claim
generate I-claim
power I-claim
releases I-claim
extensive I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
gases I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
atmosphere I-claim
which I-claim
increases I-claim
global I-claim
warming I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
solar I-premise
cooker I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
an I-premise
electric I-premise
cooker I-premise
would I-premise
certainly I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the B-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
nuclear I-premise
energy I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
alternative I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
hydro I-premise
- I-premise
kinetic I-premise
energy I-premise
causes I-premise
less I-premise
atmospheric I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
implication I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
to I-claim
promote I-claim
other I-claim
sources I-claim
of I-claim
energy I-claim
. O

This B-claim
can I-claim
make I-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
available I-claim
natural I-claim
resources I-claim
which I-claim
in I-claim
turn I-claim
would I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
global I-claim
warming I-claim
. O

Further O
, O
government O
should O
motivate O
and O
encourage O
the O
people O
to O
use O
alternative O
sources O
such O
as O
the O
solar O
and O
the O
nuclear O
energy O
. O

Should O
governments O
be O
responsible O
to O
help O
the O
unemployed O
and O
homeless O
Unemployment O
is O
clearly O
a O
global O
problem O
, O
be O
it O
in O
developed O
countries O
or O
developing O
ones O
. O

However O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
believe O
it B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
responsibility I-claim
of I-claim
these I-claim
disadvantaged I-claim
citizens I-claim
, I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
out I-claim
. O

Government B-claim
money I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
spent I-claim
on I-claim
publicly I-claim
beneficial I-claim
programs I-claim
only I-claim
. O

Tax B-premise
revenue I-premise
is I-premise
collected I-premise
from I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
works I-premise
. O

Spending B-premise
them I-premise
on I-premise
helping I-premise
those I-premise
not I-premise
make I-premise
contribution I-premise
to I-premise
society I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
sound I-premise
fair I-premise
to I-premise
tax I-premise
payers I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
other I-premise
pressing I-premise
demands I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
expenditure I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
health I-premise
care I-premise
service I-premise
and I-premise
education I-premise
, O
so O
addressing B-premise
unemployment I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
low I-premise
priority I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
, O
to B-claim
survive I-claim
in I-claim
this I-claim
competitive I-claim
world I-claim
, I-claim
one I-claim
has I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
hard I-claim
and I-claim
equip I-claim
themselves I-claim
well I-claim
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
get I-premise
free I-premise
financial I-premise
help I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
out I-premise
any I-premise
motivation I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
at I-premise
all I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this B-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
mean I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
leave I-claim
alone I-claim
those I-claim
who I-claim
do I-claim
need I-claim
assistance I-claim
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
already I-premise
in I-premise
reverse I-premise
circumstances I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
rather I-premise
difficult I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
overcome I-premise
the I-premise
difficulties I-premise
without I-premise
external I-premise
support I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
ought I-premise
to I-premise
set I-premise
up I-premise
free I-premise
vocational I-premise
trainings I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
interest I-premise
- I-premise
free I-premise
bank I-premise
loans I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
beneficial I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
whole I-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
jobless I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
contribution I-premise
again I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
my O
point O
of O
view O
is O
that O
, O
although O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
help I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
disadvantaged I-claim
people I-claim
, O
direct B-claim
financial I-claim
support I-claim
may I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
wise I-claim
option I-claim
and I-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
rely I-claim
on I-claim
themselves I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
out I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
adversity I-claim
. O

True O
function O
of O
a O
university O
Universities O
have O
quickly O
become O
the O
places O
to O
go O
when O
people O
seek O
to O
further O
develop O
their O
expertise O
. O

Whether O
this O
really O
suits O
the O
needs O
of O
their O
potential O
employers O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
as O
universities O
nowadays O
have O
evolved O
as O
a O
domain O
of O
experts O
: O
where O
more O
and O
more O
is O
known O
about O
less O
and O
less O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
among O
the O

are O
often O
some O

that O

other O

in O

However O
, O
although O
I O
respect O
the O
universities O
' O
aim O
of O
providing O
such O
courses O
to O
develop O
skills O
required O
for O
work O

support O
their O

, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
the O
main O
or O
best O
function O
of O
a O
university O
. O

A B-claim
university I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
common I-claim
sense I-claim
, I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
medium I-claim
for I-claim
conveying I-claim
or I-claim
providing I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

What O
is O
meant O
by O
this O
is O
that O
students B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
ones I-premise
universities I-premise
should I-premise
really I-premise
cater I-premise
for I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
employers I-premise
, O
as O
students B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
ones I-premise
here I-premise
to I-premise
seek I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

High B-premise
school I-premise
graduates I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
further I-premise
educate I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
universities I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
all I-premise
different I-premise
reasons I-premise
: I-premise
a I-premise
degree I-premise
that I-premise
's I-premise
more I-premise
widely I-premise
accepted I-premise
, I-premise
gain I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
insight I-premise
into I-premise
an I-premise
industry I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
simply I-premise
deepen I-premise
their I-premise
research I-premise
interests I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
field I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
universities B-premise
are I-premise
regarded I-premise
as I-premise
institutions I-premise
where I-premise
abundant I-premise
educational I-premise
resources I-premise
gather I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
, I-premise
therefore I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
course I-premise
or I-premise
type I-premise
of I-premise
training I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
offered I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
by I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
instead I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
made I-premise
available I-premise
when I-premise
needed I-premise
. O

So O
the O
truth O
lies O
somewhere O
closer O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
a B-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
offer I-claim
selected I-claim
courses I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
suitable I-claim
for I-claim
employers I-claim
' I-claim
taste I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
main I-claim
function I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
university I-claim
remains I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
provision I-claim
of I-claim
knowledge I-claim
and I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
resources I-claim
. O

It O
would O
be O
helpful O
, O
however O
, O
if O
certain O
courses O
concerning O
workplace O
skills O
can O
also O
be O
made O
available O
to O
students O
to O
help O

Zoos O
should O
be O
built O
to O
protect O
rural O
animals O
Preserving O
wild O
animals O
in O
zoos O
is O
an O
issue O
which O
frequently O
generates O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
heated O
debate O
, O
with O
supporters O
maintaining O
that O
wild O
life O
would O
be O
taken O
good O
care O
from O
professionals O
, O
while O
opponents O
claim O
that O
the O
animals O
are O
deprived O
of O
freedom O
as O
a O
result O
of O
staying O
in O
zoos O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
animals B-claim
should I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
natural I-claim
habitats I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
zoos I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
of I-premise
wild I-premise
species I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
environment I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
. O

Given B-premise
the I-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
are I-premise
responsible I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
heavy I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
severe I-premise
damage I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
habitats I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
wild I-premise
animals I-premise
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
our I-claim
responsibility I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
natural I-claim
and I-claim
safe I-claim
environment I-claim
for I-claim
animals I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
. O

Apparently O
, O
the B-premise
limited I-premise
space I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
artificial I-premise
trees I-premise
and I-premise
lakes I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
fully I-premise
compensate I-premise
the I-premise
animals I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
loss I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
if B-premise
rural I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
captured I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
period I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
have I-premise
negative I-premise
influences I-premise
on I-premise
both I-premise
the I-premise
physical I-premise
and I-premise
psychological I-premise
status I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
creatures I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the B-premise
wild I-premise
species I-premise
would I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
isolation I-premise
and I-premise
depression I-premise
. O

It O
seems O
that O
zoos B-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
killer I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
a I-claim
protector I-claim
in I-claim
protecting I-claim
wild I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
supporters O
would O
argue O
that O
zoos B-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
equipped I-claim
with I-claim
modern I-claim
facilities I-claim
and I-claim
professionals I-claim
, I-claim
would I-claim
provide I-claim
better I-claim
care I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
animals I-claim
inside I-claim
. O

They O
further O
point O
out O
that O
the B-premise
endangered I-premise
species I-premise
preserved I-premise
in I-premise
zoos I-premise
would I-premise
never I-premise
die I-premise
of I-premise
illegal I-premise
hunting I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
the B-premise
strict I-premise
laws I-premise
prohibiting I-premise
poaching I-premise
would I-premise
provide I-premise
a I-premise
shelter I-premise
for I-premise
various I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
in I-premise
natural I-premise
habitat I-premise
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the B-premise
growing I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
natural I-premise
habitat I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
ultimate I-premise
solution I-premise
of I-premise
saving I-premise
wild I-premise
animals I-premise
worldwide I-premise
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
wild B-claim
animals I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
set I-claim
free I-claim
from I-claim
zoos I-claim

not O
only O
because O
they B-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
enjoy I-claim
freedom I-claim
but I-claim
they I-claim
also I-claim
escape I-claim
from I-claim
isolation I-claim
and I-claim
depression I-claim
. O

Distance O
- O
learning O
vs. O
attending O

A O
matter O
of O
considerable O
controversy O
at O
present O
is O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
distance O
- O
learning O
should O
be O
promoted O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
or O
rather O
attending O
lectures O
in O
person O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
predominant O
place O
in O
universities O
because O
this O
way O
of O
learning O
is O
superior O
than O
online O
degrees O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
online B-claim
- I-claim
teaching I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
widely I-claim
used I-claim
among I-claim
colleges I-claim
and I-claim
universities I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
convenience I-claim
and I-claim
optimizing I-claim
cost I-claim
for I-claim
educational I-claim
institutions I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
distance B-claim
- I-claim
learning I-claim
brings I-claim
significant I-claim
convenience I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
corner I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
. O

In B-premise
earlier I-premise
times I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
were I-premise
tired I-premise
of I-premise
commuting I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
schools I-premise
nearby I-premise
, I-premise
regardless I-premise
of I-premise
any I-premise
differences I-premise
in I-premise
teaching I-premise
facilities I-premise
, I-premise
teacher I-premise
's I-premise
qualifications I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
school I-premise
reputation I-premise
. O

Now B-premise
, I-premise
however I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
apply I-premise
for I-premise
online I-premise
- I-premise
courses I-premise
provided I-premise
by I-premise
top I-premise
- I-premise
of I-premise
- I-premise
the I-premise
- I-premise
range I-premise
universities I-premise
and I-premise
colleges I-premise
worldwide I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
presence I-premise
of I-premise
video I-premise
conferencing I-premise
allows I-premise
a I-premise
teacher I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
educational B-claim
institutions I-claim
are I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
optimize I-claim
costs I-claim
by I-claim
increasing I-claim
teacher I-claim
- I-claim
student I-claim
ratios I-claim
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economical I-premise
online I-premise
- I-premise
teaching I-premise
, I-premise
universities I-premise

colleges I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
offer I-premise
grants I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
outstanding I-premise
academic I-premise
achievements I-premise
but I-premise
are I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
schools I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
financial I-premise
constrains I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
opponents O
of O
online O
- O
degrees O
would O
argue O
that O
attending B-claim
lectures I-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
provides I-claim
students I-claim
an I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
communicate I-claim
with I-claim
teachers I-claim
and I-claim
other I-claim
classmates I-claim
. O

They B-premise
further I-premise
point I-premise
out I-premise
that I-premise
traditional I-premise
teaching I-premise
approaches I-premise
involving I-premise
discussion I-premise
and I-premise
cooperation I-premise
among I-premise
students I-premise
play I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
campus I-premise
life I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
interactions I-premise
and I-premise
communications I-premise
in I-premise
class I-premise
make I-premise
education I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
attractive I-premise
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
distance B-claim
- I-claim
learning I-claim
will I-claim
become I-claim
increasingly I-claim
important I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
pace I-claim
of I-claim

increases I-claim
. O

However O
, O
discussions O

should O
be O
held O
via O

frequently O
so O
that O
the O

Do O

there O
remains O
some O
disagreement O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
overall O
effect O
of O
this O
innovation O
has O
been O
positive O
or O
negative O
. O

Although O
there B-claim
are I-claim
valid I-claim
arguments I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
contrary I-claim
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
the B-claim
majority I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
globe I-claim
have I-claim
benefited I-claim
greatly I-claim
from I-claim
these I-claim
powerful I-claim
and I-claim
effective I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
modern I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
mobile B-premise
phones I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
tools I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
communication I-premise
facilitate I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
contact I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
relatives I-premise
in I-premise
faraway I-premise
places I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
global I-premise
business I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
click I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
button I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
vast I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
transmitted I-premise
from I-premise
America I-premise
to I-premise
China I-premise
in I-premise
just I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
seconds I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
generally I-premise
felt I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
these I-premise
tools I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
is I-premise
available I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
corner I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

With B-premise
a I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
laptop I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
can I-premise
talk I-premise
or I-premise
send I-premise
messages I-premise
online I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
bus I-premise
stop I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
corner I-premise
shop I-premise
or I-premise
anywhere I-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
imagine I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
these B-claim
new I-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
do I-claim
bring I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
deal I-claim
of I-claim
convenience I-claim
to I-claim
humankind I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
opponents O
of O
modern O
communications O
claim O
that O
only O
the B-premise
more I-premise
privileged I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
the I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

They O
further O
point O
out O
that O
the B-premise
wide I-premise
spread I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
efficient I-premise
and I-premise
effective I-premise
ways I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
costs I-premise
a I-premise
considerable I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Anyone B-premise
who I-premise
aims I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
these I-premise
innovations I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
appliances I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
computer I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
cover I-premise
up I-premise
costs I-premise
for I-premise
communication I-premise
services I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
poverty I-claim
are I-claim
less I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
benefited I-claim
from I-claim
modern I-claim
communication I-claim
technologies I-claim
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
modern B-claim
communication I-claim
technologies I-claim
will I-claim
benefit I-claim
more I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
pace I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
increases I-claim
; O
however O
, O
the O
have O
- O
nots O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
simply O
because O
they O
could O
n't O
afford O
it O
. O

Should O
high O
school O
make O
music O
lessons O
compulsory O
Most O
people O
claim O
that O
in O
high O
school O
music O
must O
be O
taught O
as O
a O
main O
subject O
, O
while O
others O
say O
that O
this O
is O
an O
unnecessary O
subject O
and O
should O
at O
least O
be O
optional O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
I O
will O
give O
my O
opinion O
for O
both O
sides O
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
obvious I-premise
that I-premise
music I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
power I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
positively I-premise
influence I-premise
on I-premise
human I-premise
being I-premise
and I-premise
its I-premise
psychology I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
many B-claim
university I-claim
authorities I-claim
provide I-claim
music I-claim
lessons I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
so O
that O
they B-premise
live I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
harmony I-premise
with I-premise
music I-premise
. O

I O
have O
an O
impression O
that O
students B-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
spend I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
deal I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
studying I-premise
different I-premise
academic I-premise
subjects I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
cope I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
stress I-premise
gained I-premise
during I-premise
school I-premise
time I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
music B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
useful I-premise
and I-premise
interesting I-premise
solution I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
if B-premise
musical I-premise
activity I-premise
involves I-premise
many I-premise
participants I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
operation I-premise
and I-premise
developed I-premise
team I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
group I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
, I-premise
of I-premise
course I-premise
, I-premise
beneficial I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
life I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
students B-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
quite I-premise
poor I-premise
academic I-premise
background I-premise
can I-premise
show I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
music I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
the B-premise
calm I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
created I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
clear I-premise
that I-premise
music I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
many I-premise
mentally I-premise
enhancing I-premise
effects I-premise
on I-premise
students I-premise
. O

In O
our O
hectic O
life O
, O
however O
, O
demand B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
for I-premise
musically I-premise
orientated I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
for I-premise
academically I-premise
developed I-premise
employees I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
majority O
, O
because O
music B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
which I-premise
requires I-premise
special I-premise
attitude I-premise
towards I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Increasingly O
however O
, O
students B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
obtain I-premise
supposed I-premise
impacts I-premise
, I-premise
unless I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
it I-premise
more I-premise
seriously I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
music B-claim
and I-claim
other I-claim
entertaining I-claim
subjects I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
optional I-claim
. O

Nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
time I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
valuable I-premise
thing I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
with I-premise
increased I-premise
pace I-premise
. O

To O
my O
mind O
, O
students B-premise
are I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
professional I-premise
skills I-premise
by I-premise
learning I-premise
occupation I-premise
- I-premise
related I-premise
subjects I-premise
, I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
playing I-premise
on I-premise
guitar I-premise
or I-premise
singing I-premise
a I-premise
song I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
a O
competitive O
worker O
, O
students O
must O
know O
their O
field O
in O
an O
advanced O
level O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
music B-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
an I-claim
individual I-claim
to I-claim
shape I-claim
its I-claim
character I-claim
. O

An B-claim
integration I-claim
of I-claim
music I-claim
into I-claim
learning I-claim
process I-claim
bound I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
successful I-claim
when I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
compulsory I-claim
. O

Universities O
should O
give O
money O
to O
sport O
activities O
or O
libraries O
Libraries O
and O
sports O
activities O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
universities O
success O
. O

Most O
university O
rankings O
pay O
attention O
to O
quality O
of O
these O
two O
activities O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
universities B-claim
should I-claim
invest I-claim
in I-claim
libraries I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
anywhere I-claim
else I-claim
. O

First O
, O
I O
think O
a B-premise
library I-premise
is I-premise
vital I-premise
and I-premise
strategical I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
. O

All B-claim
professors I-claim
and I-claim
students I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
modern I-claim
and I-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim
equipped I-claim
library I-claim
because O
, O
after B-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
library I-premise
plays I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
research I-premise
. O

Although O
sport B-premise
is I-premise
important I-premise
, O
it B-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
priority I-claim
of I-claim
library I-claim
has I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
only B-premise
small I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
attend I-premise
sport I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
my I-premise
university I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
library I-premise
is I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
students I-premise
do I-premise
sports I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
usually B-premise
libraries I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
income I-premise
. O

Most B-premise
libraries I-premise
are I-premise
free I-premise
not I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
also I-premise
for I-premise
public I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
universities B-premise
support I-premise
is I-premise
vital I-premise
for I-premise
libraries I-premise
. O

But O
sport B-premise
activities I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
income I-premise
because O
every B-premise
sport I-premise
has I-premise
different I-premise
matches I-premise
and I-premise
for I-premise
each I-premise
match I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
sponsors I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
they B-premise
have I-premise
this I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
sell I-premise
their I-premise
important I-premise
matches I-premise
tickets I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
good I-claim
ways I-claim
for I-claim
sports I-claim
activities I-claim
to I-claim
compensate I-claim
their I-claim
expenses I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
hard I-claim
for I-claim
libraries I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
have I-claim
an I-claim
income I-claim
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
investing B-claim
in I-claim
libraries I-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
long I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
result I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
library I-premise
can I-premise
buy I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
new I-premise
books I-premise
or I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
buy I-premise
more I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
library I-premise
facilities I-premise
are I-premise
stable I-premise
and I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
them I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
in B-premise
the I-premise
far I-premise
future I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
valuable I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
most B-premise
sports I-premise
facilities I-premise
except I-premise
buildings I-premise
are I-premise
usually I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
in I-premise
short I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
persistent I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
sports O
activities O
, O
libraries B-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
. O

They B-claim
are I-claim
critical I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
universities I-claim
and I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
university I-claim
has I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
modern I-claim
library I-claim
. O

Humans O
should O
be O
able O
to O
use O
animals O
for O
their O
own O
benefit O
? O

Man O
has O
dominated O
all O
his O
fellow O
beings O
on O
earth O
because O
of O
his O
superior O
brain O
. O

He O
has O
domesticated O
a O
large O
number O
of O
animals O
and O
birds O
and O
makes O
use O
of O
them O
to O
make O
life O
easier O
and O
convenient O
for O
himself O
. O

Many O
people O
encourage O
the O
use O
of O
animals O
for O
their O
personal O
needs O
, O
while O
others O
are O
concerned O
that O
animals O
should O
not O
be O
misused O
. O

This O
essay O
will O
discuss O
some O
arguments O
for O
and O
against O
animal O
domestication O
. O

Human B-claim
being I-claim
has I-claim
driven I-claim
many I-claim
animals I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
personal I-claim
use I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
, I-claim
cows I-claim
and I-claim
other I-claim
milch I-claim
animals I-claim
for I-claim
yielding I-claim
milk I-claim
from I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Likewise B-premise
, I-premise
other I-premise
animals I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
, I-premise
horses I-premise
, I-premise
cattles I-premise
and I-premise
donkeys I-premise
for I-premise
farming I-premise
, I-premise
agriculture I-premise
and I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
mode I-premise
of I-premise
transportation I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
keep I-premise
pets I-premise
like I-premise
dogs I-premise
and I-premise
cats I-premise
, I-premise
trained I-premise
them I-premise
as I-premise
service I-premise
dogs I-premise
and I-premise
snuffing I-premise
dogs I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
helpful I-premise
to I-premise
police I-premise
force I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
blind I-premise
peoples I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
kept I-premise
for I-premise
security I-premise
purposes I-premise
in I-premise
houses I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
many B-claim
farmers I-claim
and I-claim
owners I-claim
exploit I-claim
animals I-claim
beyond I-claim
their I-claim
limits I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
cows B-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
injected I-premise
by I-premise
Oxytocin I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
hormone I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
forcibly I-premise
increase I-premise
lactation I-premise
. O

This B-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
, I-premise
causes I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
discomfort I-premise
and I-premise
pain I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
cattle I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
thousand B-claim
of I-claim
animals I-claim
undergo I-claim
painful I-claim
suffering I-claim
or I-claim
death I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
result I-claim
of I-claim
scientific I-claim
research I-claim
of I-claim
drugs I-claim
and I-claim
various I-claim
products I-claim
. O

Another B-premise
example I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
cage I-premise
farming I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
against I-premise
animal I-premise
rights I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
other I-premise
practices I-premise
like I-premise
, I-premise
equestrian I-premise
sport I-premise
where I-premise
horses I-premise
run I-premise
miles I-premise
and I-premise
miles I-premise
and I-premise
beaten I-premise
up I-premise
by I-premise
jockeys I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
run I-premise
more I-premise
faster I-premise
. O

And B-premise
above I-premise
all I-premise
pleasure I-premise
hunting I-premise
of I-premise
defenseless I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

From O
my O
prospective O
, O
human B-claim
being I-claim
should I-claim
behave I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
guardian I-claim
to I-claim
animals I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
as I-claim
their I-claim
lord I-claim
or I-claim
masters I-claim
. O

Animal B-claim
rights I-claim
are I-claim
meant I-claim
to I-claim
set I-claim
limits I-claim
on I-claim
human I-claim
behavior I-claim
and O
manipulation O
of O
them O
should O
be O
punished O
as O
a O
serious O
crime O
. O

Museums O
and O
art O
galleries O
will O
disappear O
soon O
? O

It O
is O
quite O
common O
that O
more O
and O
more O
people O
can O
watch O
exhibitions O
through O
television O
or O
internet O
at O
home O
due O
to O
modern O
technology O
; O
therefore O
, O
some O
people O
think O
museums O
and O
art O
galleries O
will O
disappear O
soon O
. O

Although O
modern O
technology O
make O
it O
possible O
, O
I O
still O
believe O
some B-claim
museums I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
galleries I-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
disappear I-claim
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
technology B-premise
indeed I-premise
simplifies I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
watch I-claim
exhibitions I-claim
on I-claim
TV I-claim
or I-claim
internet I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
, I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
road I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
increasingly I-claim
significant I-claim
particularly I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
. O

However O
, O
in B-premise
accordance I-premise
with I-premise
recent I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
experts I-premise
suggest I-premise
the I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
of I-premise
individuals I-premise
in I-premise
modern I-premise
society I-premise
is I-premise
unhealthy I-premise
because O
they B-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
physical I-premise
exercise I-premise
and I-premise

It B-premise

the I-premise

its I-claim

Should O

Presently O

it O

over O
eight O

differing O

all O

just O
focus O

Some O

their O
children O

While O

only O

. O

Before O

my O

I O

explore O
sides O

this O

. O

The B-claim
benefits I-claim
of I-claim
teaching I-claim
students I-claim
different I-claim
units I-claim
are I-claim
easily I-claim
recognized I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
with B-premise
some I-premise
basic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
diverse I-premise
fields I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
options I-premise
in I-premise
choosing I-premise
specialized I-premise
areas I-premise
or I-premise
jobs I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Teenagers B-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
too I-premise
young I-premise
and I-premise
immature I-premise
to I-premise
decide I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
dedicate I-premise
. O

In B-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
point I-premise
of I-premise
view I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
combination I-premise
of I-premise
difficult I-premise
and I-premise
easy I-premise
subjects I-premise
balances I-premise
their I-premise
schoolwork I-premise
stress I-premise
and I-premise
fosters I-premise
their I-premise
enthusiasm I-premise
on I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

However O
, O
still B-premise
many I-premise
teenagers I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
enjoy I-premise
the I-premise
variation I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
curriculum I-premise
, I-premise
instead I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
feel I-premise
more I-premise
stressful I-premise
with I-premise
so I-premise
much I-premise
homework I-premise
and I-premise
exams I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
done I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
most B-premise
students I-premise
regard I-premise
the I-premise
extra I-premise
knowledge I-premise
useless I-premise
and I-premise
impractical I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
jobs I-premise
. O

Those O
who O
advocate O
focusing O
on O
one O
subject O
believe O
that O
this B-claim
education I-claim
model I-claim
can I-claim
cultivate I-claim
more I-claim
talents I-claim
who I-claim
specialized I-claim
in I-claim
different I-claim
areas I-claim
and I-claim
increase I-claim
studying I-claim
effectiveness I-claim
. O

This O
is O
probably O
because O
students B-premise
can I-premise
devote I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
efforts I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
subject I-premise
and I-premise
reduce I-premise
pressure I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the O
drawbacks O
of O
this O
teaching O
method O
can O
not O
be O
neglected O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
under B-premise
such I-premise
target I-premise
- I-premise
oriented I-premise
education I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
teenagers I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
regret I-premise
their I-premise
original I-premise
choice I-premise
and I-premise
change I-premise
their I-premise
specialized I-premise
field I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
further I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise
dullness I-premise
of I-premise
course I-premise
may I-premise
deeply I-premise
influence I-premise
their I-premise
passion I-premise
on I-premise
study I-premise
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
concentrating B-claim
on I-claim
one I-claim
subject I-claim
can I-claim
reduce I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
pressure I-claim
and I-claim
foster I-claim
the I-claim
effectiveness I-claim
in I-claim
training I-claim
talents I-claim
, I-claim
while I-claim
its I-claim
shortfalls I-claim
are I-claim
so I-claim
vital I-claim
to I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
support I-claim
the I-claim
view I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
all I-claim
school I-claim
subjects I-claim

it O

a O

fact O
that O

Some O

Personally O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O

No B-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
deny I-claim
the I-claim
huge I-claim
benefits I-claim

the I-claim

To O
begin O
with O
, O
communication B-premise

In B-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
English I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
required I-premise
course I-premise
from I-premise
elementary I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
studying B-premise
abroad I-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise

becomes I-premise
hot I-premise
among I-premise
youngsters I-premise
. O

For O
them O
, O

no I-premise

This O
, O
in O

Furthermore O

those I-premise
who I-premise

Taking B-premise

Hence O

In O

I B-claim
'm I-claim
totally I-claim
convinced I-claim

I O

Creativity B-claim

Right B-premise
from I-premise

all I-premise
these I-premise

For O

would I-premise
limit I-premise

Like B-claim

Many B-premise

Competition B-claim
should I-claim

A B-premise

the I-premise

Thus O
, O
competition O

go O

These O
are O
two O
sides O

I O
firmly O

a I-claim

They O

When O

Retribution O

the O

Some O

capital O
punishment O

while O
other O
have O
a O
lot O

However O
, O
strict B-claim
laws I-claim
, I-claim
like I-claim
capital I-claim
punishment I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
essential I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Capital B-premise
punishment I-premise
is I-premise
given I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
" I-premise
rarest I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
rare I-premise
" I-premise
cases I-premise
. O

Its B-premise
first I-premise
and I-premise
foremost I-premise
objective I-premise
is I-premise
safety I-premise
of I-premise
other I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
. O

When B-premise
a I-premise
criminal I-premise
becomes I-premise
a I-premise
threat I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
commit I-premise
heinous I-premise
crimes I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
given I-premise
capital I-premise
punishment I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
capital B-claim
punishment I-claim
protects I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
from I-claim
hardcore I-claim
criminals I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
capital B-premise
punishment I-premise
curbs I-premise
the I-premise
inspiration I-premise

prospects I-premise

other I-premise
hateful I-premise
crimes I-premise

When B-premise
a I-premise
criminal I-premise
mind I-premise
knows I-premise
the I-premise
quantum I-premise
of I-premise
punishment I-premise

they I-premise
will I-premise
fear I-premise

not I-premise
commit I-premise
such I-premise
crimes I-premise

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
rate I-claim
of I-claim
crime I-claim
and I-claim
violence I-claim
is I-claim
effectively I-claim
decreased I-claim
. O

Importantly O
, O
capital B-premise
punishment I-premise
saves I-premise
a I-premise

Criminals B-claim
who I-claim

who I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
past I-claim
record I-claim

such I-claim

are I-claim

However O
, O
the B-premise

They B-claim

affect I-claim
an I-claim

The B-premise

take I-premise

the I-premise

if B-premise
an I-premise

then I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise

Capital B-claim
punishment I-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
violence I-claim
in I-claim

I O
firmly O

that O
psychopaths B-claim

any I-claim
other I-claim
criminal I-claim
who I-claim
lacks I-claim
empathy I-claim

other I-claim
human I-claim
lives I-claim
deserve I-claim
capital I-claim

Capital B-claim
punishment I-claim

to I-claim
safeguard I-claim
human I-claim
rights I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
strict I-claim
and I-claim
effective I-claim
manner I-claim

However O
, O
it O

be O
considered O
as O
the O
last O
option O
by O
the O

all O
circumstances O

Is O
a O

good O
or O
bad O
after O
high O

for O
students O

Studies O
are O
an O
essential O
part O

life O

Some O
countries O
permit O
students O
to O
take O
a O
break O
from O
studies O
between O
high O
school O
and O
university O
studies O
, O
while O
in O
some O
countries O
, O
it O
is O
considered O
as O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

However O
, O
a B-claim
break I-claim
of I-claim
one I-claim
year I-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
after I-claim
finishing I-claim
their I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
. O

In O
most O
education O
systems O

a O
child O
studies O
continuously O
from O
the O
age O
of O
5 O

16 O
years O
of O
age O
. O

A B-premise
relaxation I-premise
of I-premise
one I-premise
year I-premise
to I-premise
young I-premise
minds I-premise
will I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
a I-premise
quintessential I-premise
change I-premise
. O

A B-premise
continuous I-premise
study I-premise
pressure I-premise
for I-premise
over I-premise
10 I-premise
years I-premise
makes I-premise
the I-premise
mind I-premise
saturated I-premise
and I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
robot I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
follow I-premise
instructions I-premise
. O

Personally O
, O
a B-claim
break I-claim
will I-claim
give I-claim
students I-claim
some I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
refresh I-claim
their I-claim
systems I-claim
, I-claim
by I-claim
traveling I-claim
or I-claim
following I-claim
their I-claim
hobbies I-claim
. O

Importantly O
, O
when B-premise
students I-premise
start I-premise
their I-premise
university I-premise
studies I-premise
after I-premise
a I-premise
break I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
fresh I-premise
and I-premise
full I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
challenge I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
during O
high O
school O
, O
many O
students O
face O
a O
dilemma O
to O
decide O
which O
stream O
should O
they O
major O
in O
. O

Working B-claim
or I-claim
traveling I-claim
for I-claim
some I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
after I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
, I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
their I-claim
field I-claim
of I-claim
interest I-claim
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
also I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
professional I-premise
setup I-premise
by I-premise
working I-premise
. O

Financially B-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
a I-premise
little I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
their I-premise
university I-premise
education I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
students I-premise
even I-premise
utilize I-premise
this I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
preparation I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
desired I-premise
university I-premise
course I-premise
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
also O
disadvantages O
. O

A B-claim
break I-claim
can I-claim
disturb I-claim
the I-claim
focus I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
and I-claim
prove I-claim
detrimental I-claim
. O

When B-premise
students I-premise
work I-premise
during I-premise
these I-premise
breaks I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
feel I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
gives I-premise
them I-premise
an I-premise
illusion I-premise
that I-premise
such I-premise
salary I-premise
is I-premise
enough I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
go I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
utopia I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my B-premise
cousin I-premise
started I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
customer I-premise
care I-premise
centre I-premise
after I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
and I-premise
got I-premise
distracted I-premise
. O

When B-premise
he I-premise
started I-premise
his I-premise
university I-premise
studies I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
failed I-premise
miserably I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
indulge I-premise
in I-premise
smoking I-premise
or I-premise
drinking I-premise
during I-premise
this I-premise
time I-premise
. O

But O
, O
the O
break O
should O
be O
an O
optional O
thing O
. O

It B-premise
varies I-premise
from I-premise
individual I-premise
to I-premise
individual I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
they I-premise
utilize I-premise
that I-premise
period I-premise
. O

A B-premise
break I-premise
gives I-premise
students I-premise
more I-premise
benefits I-premise
than I-premise
harms I-premise
. O

Importantly O
, O
the B-claim
sole I-claim
purpose I-claim
of I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
nurture I-claim
a I-claim
young I-claim
mind I-claim
and I-claim
not I-claim
thrust I-claim
studies I-claim
on I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
a B-claim
break I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
necessarily I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
young I-claim
minds I-claim
between I-claim
their I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
and I-claim
university I-claim
studies I-claim
. O

Countries O
, O
like O
India O
, O
where O
such O
a O
break O
is O
considered O
a O
blot O
, O
should O
understand O
that O
young O
minds O
are O
delicate O
and O
they O
face O
a O
cut O
- O
throat O
competition O
. O

One O
year O
break O
can O
help O
young O
people O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
challenges O
of O
life O
. O

Should O
universities O

not O
Education O

important O
for O
the O

Its O
a O

whether O
universities O
should O
accept O
equal O
number O
of O
males O
and O

in O
a O
course O
or O
not O
. O

However O
, O
since O
both O
genders O
are O
equally O
important O
, O
both O
must O
be O
given O
equal O
opportunities O
. O

Universities B-claim
must I-claim
admit I-claim
both I-claim
in I-claim
equal I-claim
numbers I-claim
, I-claim
depending I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
choices I-claim
. O

Right B-premise
to I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
basic I-premise
human I-premise
right I-premise
of I-premise
both I-premise
, I-premise
males I-premise

females I-premise
. O

The B-premise
whole I-premise
world I-premise
aims I-premise
for I-premise
women I-premise
empowerment I-premise

achieve O
this O
, O
females B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
given I-claim
equal I-claim

When B-premise
universities I-premise
will I-premise
accept I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
equal I-premise
number I-premise
, I-premise
both I-premise
genders I-premise

be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
nurture I-premise
their I-premise
talent I-premise

a I-premise
healthy I-premise
competitive I-premise
environment I-premise

Co B-premise

education I-premise

both I-premise

gel I-premise

each I-premise
other I-premise

It B-premise
helps I-premise
them I-premise
how I-premise

behave I-premise
and I-premise
cooperate I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
together I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
studying I-premise
in I-premise
boy I-premise
's I-premise
colleges I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
generally I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
female I-premise
or I-premise
behave I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
females B-premise
studying I-premise
in I-premise
girl I-premise
's I-premise
colleges I-premise
are I-premise
too I-premise
shy I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
boys I-premise
. O

Co B-premise
- I-premise
education I-premise
will I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
eradicate I-premise
this I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
demerit I-premise
in I-premise
both I-premise
. O

Universities B-claim
giving I-claim
both I-claim
genders I-claim
equal I-claim
opportunities I-claim
, I-claim
will I-claim
prepare I-claim
them I-claim
for I-claim
future I-claim
challenges I-claim
and I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
long I-claim
run I-claim
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
some B-claim
male I-claim
chauvinists I-claim
think I-claim
that I-claim
women I-claim
are I-claim
incapable I-claim
in I-claim
particular I-claim
fields I-claim
, I-claim
like I-claim
maths I-claim
, I-claim
mechanical I-claim
engineering I-claim
, I-claim
defense I-claim
etc I-claim
. O

This B-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
gender I-premise
biased I-premise
approach I-premise
is I-premise
detrimental I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

Time O
and O
again O
, O
women B-premise
have I-premise
proved I-premise
their I-premise
mettle I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
field I-premise

Women B-premise
like I-premise
Margaret I-premise
Thatcher I-premise

Indira I-premise
Gandhi I-premise
, I-premise
Mari I-premise
Curie I-premise
etc I-premise
. I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
symbols I-premise
of I-premise
women I-premise
's I-premise
intelligence I-premise
and I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
both B-claim
genders I-claim
have I-claim
equal I-claim
rights I-claim
and I-claim
universities I-claim
should I-claim
accept I-claim
them I-claim
in I-claim
equal I-claim
numbers I-claim
. O

Equality B-claim
in I-claim
education I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
in I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Both B-premise
genders I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
fulcrum I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
and I-premise
none I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
is I-premise
superior I-premise

inferior I-premise
. O

Choice O

the O
discretion O
of O
the O
student O

their O
merit O
, O
irrespective O
of O
the O
gender O

Educational O
rights O

be O
given O

both O

People O
will O
spend O
less O

Perhaps O
, O
no O
issue O
in O
this O
world O
is O
as O
significant O
to O
people O
as O
cooking O

because O
it O

Some O
people O
hold O
the O
opinion O
that O
people O
should O
spend O
much O

on O

However O
, O
I O
do O
think O
that O
people B-claim
are I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
less I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
cooking I-claim
food I-claim
. O

There O
are O
various O
reasons O
why O
I O
maintain O
this O
viewpoint O
, O
and O
among O
those O
reasons O
are O
two O
important O
ones O
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
is O
that O
with B-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
science I-premise

technology I-premise
, I-premise
more I-premise
advanced I-premise
kitchen I-premise

such I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
modern I-premise
microwaves I-premise

the I-premise
advanced I-premise
pressure I-premise
cookers I-premise

have I-premise
been I-premise
created I-premise

invented I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
people I-premise
prepare I-premise

cook I-premise
food I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people B-premise
nowadays I-premise
just I-premise
spend I-premise
one I-premise
hour I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
a I-premise
meal I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
two I-premise

even I-premise
three I-premise
hours I-premise
like I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
last I-premise
10 I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Actually O
, O
in B-premise
recent I-premise
years I-premise

there I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
increase I-premise

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
certain I-claim
that I-claim
spending I-claim
less I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
cooking I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
the I-claim
main I-claim
trend I-claim
in I-claim
near I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
most B-claim
of I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
meals I-claim
at I-claim
restaurants I-claim
because O
they B-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
invest I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
or I-premise
study I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

According O
to O
a O
recent O
survey O
, O
89 B-premise
% I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
come I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
since I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
put I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
situation I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
filled I-premise
with I-premise
competitions I-premise
and I-premise
pressures I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
hard I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
update I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
all I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
they B-premise
find I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
and I-premise
cook I-premise
a I-premise
meal I-premise
. O

Even B-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
some I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
out I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
to I-premise
relax I-premise
and I-premise
relieve I-premise
the I-premise
pressure I-premise
from I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
investing B-claim
much I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
cooking I-claim
food I-claim
will I-claim
guarantee I-claim
nutrition I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
food I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
family I-claim
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
it O
is O
true O
. O

However O
, O
as B-premise
a I-premise
matter I-premise
of I-premise
fact I-premise
, I-premise
using I-premise
technology I-premise
or I-premise
advanced I-premise
facilities I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
make I-premise
food I-premise
lose I-premise
its I-premise
nutrition I-premise
and I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

Even B-premise
, I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
ozone I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
bacterias I-premise
, I-premise
mold I-premise
spores I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
pesticide I-premise
in I-premise
vegetables I-premise
, I-premise
fruits I-premise
and I-premise
foods I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
killed I-premise
and I-premise
removed I-premise
, O
thus O
health B-premise
and I-premise
life I-premise
of I-premise
eaters I-premise
is I-premise
assured I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
along B-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
high I-premise
living I-premise
standard I-premise
, I-premise
requirements I-premise
of I-premise
quality I-premise
products I-premise
in I-premise
almost I-premise
restaurants I-premise
, I-premise
nowadays I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
under I-premise
severe I-premise
control I-premise
and I-premise
supervision I-premise
by I-premise
appropriate I-premise
authorities I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
quite I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
nutritious I-premise
meal I-premise
with I-premise
guaranteed I-premise
quality I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
waste I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
if O
all O
those O
factors O

contemplated O
, O
it O
is O
obviously O
found O
that O
there O
are O
many O
solid O
reasons O

my O
viewpoint O
. O

So O
, O
from O
what O
have O
been O
discussed O
above O
, O
I O
strongly O
affirm O
the O
conclusion O
that O
people B-claim
will I-claim
spend I-claim
less I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
cooking I-claim
food I-claim
. O

Traditional O
games O
or O
modern O
games O
in O
developing O
children O

Games O
have O
played O
a O
key O
role O
in O
children O
's O
growth O
, O
especially O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
abilities O
. O

With O
technological O
advances O
, O
children O
have O
more O
access O
to O
modern O
games O
currently O
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
traditional O
games O
and O
modern O
games O
in O
children O
's O
developments O
of O
skills O
has O
become O
a O
frequent O
topic O
of O
discussion O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
believe O
parents B-claim
and I-claim
educators I-claim
should I-claim
attach I-claim
more I-claim
importance I-claim
to I-claim
traditional I-claim
games I-claim
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
modern B-claim
games I-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
extent I-claim
, I-claim
beneficial I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
foster I-claim
some I-claim
skills I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
computer I-claim
skills I-claim
or I-claim
the I-claim
capacity I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
up I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
latest I-claim
trend I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
children B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
proficient I-premise
at I-premise
computers I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
join I-premise
online I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
fact I-premise
, I-premise
helps I-premise
children I-premise
acquire I-premise
a I-premise
particularly I-premise
powerful I-premise
skill I-premise
at I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
future I-premise
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
children B-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
experience I-premise
the I-premise
state I-premise
- I-premise
of I-premise
- I-premise
the I-premise
- I-premise
art I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
raising I-premise
their I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
innovation I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
stay I-premise
conservative I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
traditional B-claim
games I-claim
are I-claim
still I-claim
indispensible I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
learning I-claim
process I-claim
, I-claim
even I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
essential I-claim
than I-claim
modern I-claim
games I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
. O

One B-premise
primary I-premise
merit I-premise
of I-premise
traditional I-premise
games I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
foster I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
communication I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Unlike B-premise
most I-premise
modern I-premise
games I-premise
which I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
interactions I-premise
between I-premise
children I-premise
and I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
traditional I-premise
games I-premise
provide I-premise
a I-premise
relaxing I-premise
and I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
where I-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
chat I-premise
, I-premise
laugh I-premise
and I-premise
cooperate I-premise
face I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
communicating B-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
an I-premise
issue I-premise
for I-premise
these I-premise
children I-premise
any I-premise
more I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
educational I-claim
functions I-claim
traditional I-claim
games I-claim
hold I-claim
that I-claim
keep I-claim
them I-claim
alive I-claim
today I-claim
. O

In O
fact O
, O
these B-premise
traditional I-premise
games I-premise
were I-premise
elaborately I-premise
devised I-premise
by I-premise
educators I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
proven I-premise
effective I-premise
in I-premise
improving I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
skills I-premise
on I-premise
different I-premise
aspects I-premise
in I-premise
previous I-premise
teaching I-premise
practices I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
modern B-premise
games I-premise
are I-premise
developed I-premise
by I-premise
game I-premise
companies I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
profits I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
risk I-premise
that I-premise
children I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
exposed I-premise
to I-premise
unhealthy I-premise
contents I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
violence I-premise
or I-premise
pornography I-premise
, I-premise
arranged I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
games I-premise
by I-premise
such I-premise
companies I-premise
to I-premise
secure I-premise
financial I-premise
survival I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
traditional B-claim
games I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
, I-claim
by I-claim
no I-claim
means I-claim
, I-claim
ignored I-claim
by I-claim
parents I-claim
and I-claim
teachers I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
advent I-claim
of I-claim
modern I-claim
games I-claim
. O

Only B-claim
through I-claim
traditional I-claim
games I-claim
can I-claim
children I-claim
be I-claim
ensured I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
and I-claim
healthy I-claim
skills I-claim
learning I-claim

Government O

Recently O

some O
people O
argue O
that O
government B-claim
should I-claim
invest I-claim
more I-claim
on I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
on I-claim
entertaining I-claim
or I-claim
sports I-claim
facilities I-claim
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
this O
proposal O
is O
beneficial O
more O
to O
the O
society O
. O

Taking B-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
thousands I-premise
of I-premise
citizens I-premise
who I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
disease I-premise
or I-premise
illiteracy I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
urgent I-premise
and I-premise
pragmatic I-premise
than I-premise
building I-premise
theaters I-premise
or I-premise
sports I-premise
stadiums I-premise
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
an B-premise
uneducated I-premise
person I-premise
may I-premise
barely I-premise
appreciate I-premise
musicals I-premise
, I-premise
whereas I-premise
a I-premise
physical I-premise
damaged I-premise
person I-premise
, I-premise
resulting I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
medical I-premise
treatment I-premise
, I-premise
may I-premise
no I-premise
longer I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
any I-premise
sports I-premise
games I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
providing B-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
essential I-claim
and I-claim
prioritized I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
. O

Entertaining B-claim
facilities I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
cinemas I-claim
, I-claim
theaters I-claim
and I-claim
sports I-claim
stadiums I-claim
are I-claim
mostly I-claim
profit I-claim
- I-claim
oriented I-claim
. O

Their B-premise
existences I-premise
are I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
marketing I-premise
strategies I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
condition I-premise
of I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
volume I-premise
of I-premise
audience I-premise
. O

The B-premise
competition I-premise
among I-premise
each I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
facilities I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
inevitable I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
free I-premise
market I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
interfered I-premise
by I-premise
government I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
the B-premise
establishment I-premise
of I-premise
medical I-premise
facilities I-premise
or I-premise
educational I-premise
institutes I-premise
is I-premise
aimed I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise

education I-premise
standard I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
earning I-premise
profits I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
deserves I-premise
more I-premise
funds I-premise
from I-premise
government I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
putting B-premise
taxpayers I-premise
' I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
building I-premise
theaters I-premise
or I-premise
sports I-premise
stadiums I-premise
is I-premise
unfair I-premise
to I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
use I-premise
them I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
not B-premise
everyone I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
fan I-premise
of I-premise
watching I-premise
musicals I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
spot I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
bit I-premise
inappropriate I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
citizens I-premise
' I-premise
tax I-premise
funds I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
a I-premise
minority I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

That O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
sectors B-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
deserve I-claim
more I-claim
governmental I-claim
support I-claim
, O
because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
accessed I-premise
by I-premise
every I-premise
individual I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
society I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
daily I-premise
basis I-premise
. O

To O
summarize O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
budgets B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
allocated I-claim
more I-claim
on I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
on I-claim
building I-claim

because O
the B-claim
former I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
essential I-claim
, I-claim
non I-claim

Technology O

Living O
in O

people O

firmly O
convinced O
that O

the O

Thus O

modern O

a O

the O
preservation O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
their O
concern O

groundless O
. O

Instead O
, O
technology B-claim
plays I-claim
a I-claim
key I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
promoting I-claim
traditional I-claim
techniques I-claim
and I-claim
lifestyles I-claim
. O

In B-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
space I-claim
, I-claim
technology I-claim
makes I-claim
it I-claim
more I-claim
efficient I-claim
and I-claim
effective I-claim
to I-claim
promote I-claim
the I-claim
traditional I-claim
skills I-claim

ways I-claim

. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
only I-premise
when I-premise
people I-premise
went I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
place I-premise
could I-premise
they I-premise
experience I-premise
the I-premise
specific I-premise
traditional I-premise
lifestyles I-premise
. O

This B-premise
means I-premise
individuals I-premise
who I-premise
were I-premise
engaged I-premise
in I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
or I-premise
restricted I-premise
by I-premise
traffic I-premise
conditions I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
miss I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
appreciate I-premise
the I-premise
traditional I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

However O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
greatest I-premise
innovations I-premise
in I-premise
modern I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
humankind I-premise
can I-premise
acquire I-premise
the I-premise
traditional I-premise
techniques I-premise
displayed I-premise
online I-premise
anytime I-premise
, I-premise
anywhere I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
technology B-claim
enriches I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
displaying I-claim
traditional I-claim
cultural I-claim
heritage I-claim
, I-claim
making I-claim
it I-claim
more I-claim
vivid I-claim
and I-claim
appealing I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
China B-premise
has I-premise
successfully I-premise
promoted I-premise
traditional I-premise
techniques I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
Shanghai I-premise
World I-premise
Expo I-premise
, I-premise
using I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
state I-premise
- I-premise
of I-premise

the I-premise
- I-premise
art I-premise
technological I-premise
methods I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
robots I-premise
and I-premise
LED I-premise
screens I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many B-premise
tourists I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
marveled I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
perfect I-premise
synthesis I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
modern I-premise
technology I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
traditional I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
concerned I-claim
that I-claim
technology I-claim
may I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
detrimental I-claim
effect I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
traditional I-claim
lifestyles I-claim
. O

They O
argue O
that O
people O
, O
especially B-premise
youngsters I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
crazier I-premise
about I-premise
fresh I-premise
and I-premise
advanced I-premise
things I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
digital I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
becoming I-premise
indifferent I-premise
to I-premise
traditional I-premise
techniques I-premise
. O

But O
I O
believe O
this O
is O
not O
the O
issue O
because O
people B-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
follow I-premise
the I-premise
trend I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
tradition I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
recent I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
will O
conclude O

It O
is O
my O
personal O
belief O
that O
freedom B-claim

should I-claim
always I-claim
be I-claim
eulogized I-claim

it I-claim
's I-claim
rather I-claim
iniquitous I-claim
to I-claim
impose I-claim
a I-claim
shackle I-claim
on I-claim
artists I-claim
' I-claim
will I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim

One B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
major I-claim
concerns I-claim
against I-claim
freeing I-claim
artists I-claim
' I-claim
creation I-claim
derives I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
fear I-claim
of I-claim
social I-claim
misleading I-claim
which I-claim
would I-claim
destabilize I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
; O
however O
, O
I O
believe O
the B-premise
audiences I-premise
have I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
judgement I-premise
and I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
misled I-premise
or I-premise
influenced I-premise
by I-premise
some I-premise
art I-premise
work I-premise
. O

It O
is O
needless O
to O
say O
that O
art B-premise
inevitably I-premise
involves I-premise
imagination I-premise
, I-premise
exaggeration I-premise
and I-premise
sometimes I-premise
is I-premise
purely I-premise
fabricated I-premise

If B-premise

unreality I-premise

the I-premise

certainly I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
acumen I-premise

recognise I-premise
its I-premise
untruthfulness I-premise

only I-premise
appreciate I-premise
its I-premise
art I-premise
value I-premise
; O
if O
the O
art O
reflects O
the O
reality O

then O
what O
would O
be O
the O
intention O
to O
ban O
it O
if O
it O
was O
not O
for O
covering O
the O
dirty O
truth O

Would O
it O
be O
autocratic O
if O
the O
government O
clamp O
down O
the O
artists O

telling O
the O

? O

In O
a O
word O
, O
the B-premise
notion I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
afraid I-premise

social I-premise

unjustified I-premise
. O

Let O

then O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O

that O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
some B-premise

I O
absolutely O
agree O
that O
restrictions B-claim

apply I-claim

nothing I-premise

these I-premise

By O

I O
do O

the O

a I-claim

To O
start O
with O

the B-premise
fairness I-premise
between I-premise

inevitable I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise

Gone B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
days I-premise
when I-premise
women I-premise
could I-premise
do I-premise
nothing I-premise
rather I-premise

stick I-premise

boring I-premise
house I-premise

Women B-claim
nowadays I-claim
are I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
active I-claim

they I-claim

This O

In O
the O

the B-claim
revolution I-claim

brought I-claim

The B-premise
financial I-premise

What O
is O
more O

women B-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
outstanding I-premise
instinct I-premise

take I-premise
up I-premise
some I-premise

Admittedly O
, O
such B-claim
changes I-claim
do I-claim
lead I-claim

some I-claim
negative I-claim
results I-claim

an I-claim

their I-premise
traditional I-premise

Yet O
everything O

it O
upside O

find O
the O
best O
way O

such O

All O
things O
considered O

in B-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
where I-claim
females I-claim
are I-claim
given I-claim
equal I-claim
opportunities I-claim
compared I-claim

would I-claim
obviously I-claim
enjoy I-claim
lots I-claim

Growing O

As O

As O
the O
impacts O
for O
those O
pollution O

traffic O
issues O
are O
extremely O
far O
- O
reaching O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
insufficient I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
petrol I-claim
price I-claim
only I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
problems I-claim
, O
though O
it O

plenty I-premise

social I-premise
areas I-premise

for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
farming I-premise
products I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise

area I-premise
; O
however O
, O
whether B-premise
it I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
out I-premise
for I-premise
alleviating I-premise
traffic I-premise
and I-premise
pollution I-premise
pressure I-premise
ought I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
evaluated I-premise

On O
one O
hand O
, O
governments B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
macro I-premise
- I-premise
economic I-premise
perspective I-premise

control I-premise
price I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
areas I-premise
according I-premise

Consequently O
, O
it B-claim
seems I-claim
not I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
petrol I-claim
price I-claim
instantly I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
pollutions B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
just I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
burning I-premise
of I-premise
oil I-premise
, I-premise
chemical I-premise
pollutants I-premise
, I-premise
extra I-premise

also I-premise
constitute I-premise
considerable I-premise
amount I-premise

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
improvements I-premise

also I-premise
attribute I-premise

As O
illustrated O
before O
, O
several B-claim
other I-claim
solutions I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
introduced I-claim
to I-claim
assist I-claim
in I-claim
reducing I-claim
pollution I-claim

traffic I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

Primarily O
, O
authorities B-premise
should I-premise
spare I-premise
no I-premise
efforts I-premise
in I-premise
improving I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
facilities I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
constructing I-premise
more I-premise
bus I-premise
lines I-premise

in I-premise
order I-premise

reducing I-premise
the I-premise
usage I-premise
of I-premise
private I-premise

. O

Furthermore O
, O
temporarily B-premise
targets I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
set I-premise

with I-premise

the I-premise
limitations I-premise
of I-premise

in I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise

for I-premise

, I-premise
a I-premise
season I-premise
. O

Plus O
with B-premise
supervisory I-premise
institutions I-premise
built I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise

address I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
cultivating B-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
environmental I-premise
protection I-premise
would I-premise
also I-premise
work I-premise
out I-premise
, I-premise
though I-premise
it I-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
into I-premise
effect I-premise
immediately I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
long I-premise
run I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
wise I-premise
choice I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
addressing B-claim
pollution I-claim
and I-claim
traffic I-claim
issues I-claim
only I-claim
by I-claim
increasing I-claim
oil I-claim
price I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
adequate I-claim
, O
while O
improving O
transportation O

and O
building O
supervisory O

would O
be O
preferable O
, O
plus O
with O
the O
awareness O
of O
environmental O
protection O
being O
raised O
. O

Is O
image O
more O
powerful O
than O
the O
written O
word O
? O

" O
A O
picture O
is O
worth O
a O
thousand O
words O
" O
is O
a O
popular O
maxim O
that O
is O
being O
used O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

This O
strongly O
depicts O
the O
power O
of O
images O
in O
conveying O
messages O
, O
ideas O
, O
or O
opinions O
to O
people O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
importance O
of O
written O
word O
can O
never O
be O
denied O
as O
it O
is O
also O
another O
way O
of O
communication O
that O
is O
commonly O
used O
. O

Hence O
, O
I B-claim
agree I-claim
only I-claim
to I-claim
certain I-claim
degree I-claim
that I-claim
in I-claim
today I-claim
's I-claim
world I-claim
, I-claim
image I-claim
serves I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
effective I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
pictures B-claim
can I-claim
influence I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
people I-claim
think I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays B-premise
horrendous I-premise
images I-premise
are I-premise
displayed I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
cigarette I-premise
boxes I-premise
to I-premise
illustrate I-premise
the I-premise
consequences I-premise
of I-premise
smoking I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
statistics B-premise
show I-premise
a I-premise
slight I-premise
reduction I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
smokers I-premise
, I-premise
indicating I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
realize I-premise
the I-premise
effects I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
negative I-premise
habit I-premise
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the B-premise
magnificent I-premise
photograph I-premise
captured I-premise
by I-premise
Kevin I-premise
Carter I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
portrayed I-premise
a I-premise
starving I-premise
Sudanese I-premise
child I-premise
struck I-premise
by I-premise
extreme I-premise
poverty I-premise
has I-premise
successfully I-premise
highlighted I-premise
the I-premise
plight I-premise
faced I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
citizens I-premise
in I-premise
Sudan I-premise
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
images B-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
widely I-premise
used I-premise
in I-premise
newspapers I-premise
, I-premise
magazines I-premise
and I-premise
advertisements I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
undeniable I-claim
that I-claim
images I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
absence I-claim
of I-claim
words I-claim
can I-claim
obviously I-claim
claim I-claim
the I-claim
attraction I-claim
of I-claim
many I-claim
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
written B-claim
words I-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
vital I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
spread I-claim
across I-claim
certain I-claim
messages I-claim
. O

With B-premise
only I-premise
pictures I-premise
, I-premise
everyone I-premise
is I-premise
left I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
interpretation I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
they I-premise
perceive I-premise
the I-premise
images I-premise
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
this B-premise
is I-premise
different I-premise
when I-premise
words I-premise
are I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
explain I-premise
what I-premise
the I-premise
illustration I-premise
is I-premise
about I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
primary I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
educating I-premise
students I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
by I-premise
this I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Academic B-premise
textbooks I-premise
these I-premise
days I-premise
are I-premise
laden I-premise
with I-premise
words I-premise
besides I-premise
pictures I-premise
to I-premise
guide I-premise
the I-premise
readers I-premise
to I-premise
comprehend I-premise
better I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
both B-claim
images I-claim
and I-claim
words I-claim
go I-claim
hand I-claim
in I-claim
hand I-claim
and I-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
wholly I-claim
emphasise I-claim
on I-claim
only I-claim
one I-claim
aspect I-claim
, I-claim
either I-claim
images I-claim
or I-claim
words I-claim
. O

Hence O
, O
for O
a O
more O
meaningful O
communication O
, O
these O
two O
elements O
have O
their O
respective O
roles O
to O
play O
: O
image O
to O
exemplify O
and O
words O
to O
describe O
a O
particular O
subject O
. O

Several O
languages O
are O
in O
danger O
of O
extinction O

It O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
some O
languages O
are O
disappearing O
day O
by O
day O
over O
the O
world O
. O

Some O
people O
, O
therefore O
, O
harbour O
a O
view O
saying O
that O
governments O
should O
preserve O
those O
by O
spending O
some O
budgets O
on O
them O
. O

But O
the O
others O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
possible O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
viewpoint O
needs O
to O
be O
examined O
thoroughly O
and O
this O
essay O
will O
discuss O
this O
issue O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
languages I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
oral I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
quite I-premise
major I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
culture I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
. O

It B-premise
helps I-premise
people I-premise
distinguish I-premise
between I-premise
nations I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
regions I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
. O

The B-premise
clearance I-premise
of I-premise
minority I-premise
of I-premise
language I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
national I-premise
traditional I-premise
, I-premise
customs I-premise
and I-premise
habitants I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
exist I-premise
. O

Governments B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
keeping I-claim
and I-claim
preserving I-claim
these I-claim
things I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
rich I-claim
diversity I-claim
of I-claim
cultures I-claim
which I-claim
make I-claim
our I-claim
world I-claim
more I-claim
interesting I-claim
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
pride I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
rage I-premise
of I-premise
culture I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
educate I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
love I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
more I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
drawbacks I-claim
from I-claim
saving I-claim
minority I-claim
languages I-claim
. O

Although O
governments B-premise
invest I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
doing I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
gain I-premise
the I-premise
good I-premise
results I-premise
. O

As O
evidence O
of O
this O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
particularly I-premise
the I-premise
youngsters I-premise
, I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
pay I-premise
attention I-premise
on I-premise
collecting I-premise
and I-premise
studying I-premise
those I-premise
. O

These B-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
languages I-premise
are I-premise
usually I-premise
difficult I-premise
and I-premise
unpopular I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
preservations I-premise
need I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
gather I-premise
, I-premise
restore I-premise
all I-premise
information I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
train I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
educational I-premise
centre I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
try I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
protection I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
halted I-premise
and I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
all B-claim
languages I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
preserved I-claim
and I-claim
developed I-claim
as I-claim
much I-claim
as I-claim
possible I-claim
. O

All O
people O
should O
give O
a O
hand O
to O
do O
this O
better O
and O
governments O
play O
a O
vital O
role O
on O
encouraging O
and O
distributing O
those O
. O

Do O
arts O
and O
music O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
? O

My O
view O
is O
that O
the O
government B-claim
should I-claim
give I-claim
priorities I-claim
to I-claim
invest I-claim
more I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
basic I-claim
social I-claim
welfares I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
housing I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
subsidizing I-claim
arts I-claim
relative I-claim
programs I-claim
. O

Art B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
key I-claim
determination I-claim
of I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
people I-premise
better I-premise
off I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
urgent I-premise
for I-premise
governments I-premise
to I-premise
commit I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
fundamental I-premise
help I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
setting I-premise
more I-premise
scholarships I-premise
in I-premise
education I-premise
section I-premise
for I-premise
all I-premise
citizens I-premise
. O

This O
is O
simply O
because O
knowledge B-premise
and I-premise
wisdom I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
guarantee I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
enhancement I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
lives I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
rounded I-premise
social I-premise
system I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
art B-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
extent I-claim
, I-claim
serve I-claim
a I-claim
valuable I-claim
function I-claim
about I-claim
enriching I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
daily I-claim
lives I-claim
, O
for O
example O
, O
it B-premise
could I-premise
bring I-premise
release I-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
heavy I-premise
burden I-premise
of I-premise
study I-premise
pressure I-premise
and I-premise
refresh I-premise
human I-premise
bodies I-premise
through I-premise
a I-premise
hard I-premise
day I-premise
from I-premise
work I-premise
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
unrealistic I-premise
to I-premise
pursuit I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
high I-premise
standard I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
the I-premise
basic I-premise
housing I-premise
supply I-premise
has I-premise
still I-premise
been I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
problem I-premise
with I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
lower I-premise
income I-premise
family I-premise
have I-premise
squeezed I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
tight I-premise
room I-premise
. O

By B-premise
comparison I-premise
to I-premise
these I-premise
issues I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
pursuit I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
seems I-premise
unimportant I-premise
at I-premise
all I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
art B-claim
could I-claim
play I-claim
an I-claim
active I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
improving I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
lives I-claim
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
attach I-claim
heavier I-claim
weight I-claim
to I-claim
other I-claim
social I-claim
issues I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
housing I-claim
needs I-claim
because O
those B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
essential I-claim
ways I-claim
enable I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
a I-claim
decent I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Government O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
education O
and O
health O
care O
or O
not O
? O

Despite O
the O
development O
of O
modern O
society O
, O
the O
health O
care O
and O
education O
still O
remain O
the O
basic O
rights O
of O
citizens O
. O

And O
a O
much O
debated O
issue O
these O
days O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
government O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
citizens O
' O
health O
care O
and O
education O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
that I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
obligated I-premise
to I-premise
fund I-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise
care I-premise
and I-premise
education I-premise
for I-premise
citizens I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
citizens B-premise
enjoy I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
harmonious I-premise
and I-premise
stable I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
enabled I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
leader I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

If B-premise
citizens I-premise
had I-premise
no I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
health I-premise
care I-premise
and I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
physical I-premise
health I-premise
and I-premise
psychological I-premise
soundness I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
at I-premise
risk I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
such B-premise
people I-premise
might I-premise
fail I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
cured I-premise
in I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
influencing I-premise
their I-premise
working I-premise
efficiency I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
would I-premise
destabilize I-premise
the I-premise
production I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
industry I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
without B-premise
sufficient I-premise
guidance I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
citizens I-premise
might I-premise
misbehave I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
commit I-premise
crimes I-premise
, I-premise
posing I-premise
a I-premise
threat I-premise
to I-premise
other I-premise
citizens I-premise
' I-premise
security I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
accountable I-claim
for I-claim
citizens I-claim
' I-claim
health I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
society I-claim
safe I-claim
and I-claim
stable I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O
people O
oppose O
the O
argument O
, O
saying O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
to I-claim
subsidize I-claim
health I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
of I-claim
each I-claim
citizen I-claim
in I-claim
society I-claim
, O
since O
a B-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
fact I-premise
, I-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
the I-premise
capacity I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
both I-premise
privately I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
should I-premise
give I-premise
priority I-premise
to I-premise
more I-premise
pressing I-premise
problems I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
social I-premise
members I-premise
' I-premise
wellbeing I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
soaring I-premise
crime I-premise
rate I-premise
, I-premise
AIDS I-premise
epidemic I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
shortage I-premise
of I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
requiring I-premise
financial I-premise
resources I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
to I-premise
address I-premise
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
fund I-claim
the I-claim
deprived I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
care I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
, I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
group I-claim
in I-claim
real I-claim
need I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
authority I-claim
's I-claim
help I-claim
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
citizens O
available O
for O
the O
both O
should O
encourage O
the O
government O
to O
allocate O
money O
to O
more O
urgent O
areas O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
harmonious O
society O
calls O
for O
the O
joint O
efforts O
of O
the O
government O
and O
citizens O
. O

Economic O
development O
vs O
environment O

Currently O
, O
a O
great O
number O
of O
countries O
have O
pushed O
forward O
their O
economies O
by O
developing O
national O
industries O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
are O
worried O
that O
the O
economic O
targets O
in O
industrialized O
countries O
may O
be O
attained O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
ecosystems O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
think O
flourishing B-claim
economies I-claim
can I-claim
go I-claim
hand I-claim
in I-claim
hand I-claim
with I-claim
environmental I-claim
preservation I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
some B-premise
countries I-premise
may I-premise
place I-premise
economic I-premise
developments I-premise
ahead I-premise
of I-premise
environmental I-premise
protection I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
ruining I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
environments I-premise
. O

As O
these B-premise
needy I-premise
countries I-premise
lack I-premise
adequate I-premise
financial I-premise
and I-premise
human I-premise
resources I-premise
, I-premise
advanced I-premise
technologies I-premise
and I-premise
experience I-premise
, O
they B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
rely I-premise
on I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
their I-premise
living I-premise
standards I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
people B-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
poverty I-premise
- I-premise
stricken I-premise
areas I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
equipped I-premise
with I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
preserve I-premise
the I-premise
ecosystems I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
unchecked B-premise
and I-premise
reckless I-premise
uses I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
raw I-premise
materials I-premise
may I-premise
happen I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
put I-premise
a I-premise
strain I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
. O

In O
this O
view O
, O
the B-claim
economic I-claim
development I-claim
and I-claim
environmental I-claim
protection I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
conflicting I-claim
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
the B-claim
booming I-claim
economy I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
closely I-claim
linked I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
preservation I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

With B-premise
people I-premise
raising I-premise
their I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
green I-premise
economy I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
products I-premise
free I-premise
of I-premise
pollutants I-premise
are I-premise
increasingly I-premise
prevalent I-premise
among I-premise
clients I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
means I-premise
eco I-premise
- I-premise
friendly I-premise
businesses I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
favorable I-premise
impression I-premise
on I-premise
customers I-premise
today I-premise
, I-premise
triggering I-premise
sales I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
electronic B-premise
bicycles I-premise
powered I-premise
by I-premise
clean I-premise
energy I-premise
resources I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
well I-premise
received I-premise
among I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
recent I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
taking B-claim
environmental I-claim
consequences I-claim
seriously I-claim
can I-claim
enhance I-claim
working I-claim
efficiencies I-claim
. O

If B-premise
a I-premise
firm I-premise
is I-premise
environmentally I-premise
conscious I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
may I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
optimal I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
resources I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
its I-premise
production I-premise
lines I-premise
and I-premise
equipment I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
boost I-premise
productivity I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-premise
may I-premise
spur I-premise
its I-premise
economic I-premise
development I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
without B-premise
the I-premise
requirement I-premise
of I-premise
environmental I-premise
preservation I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
firm I-premise
would I-premise
still I-premise
consume I-premise
a I-premise
vast I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
which I-premise
constitutes I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
operational I-premise
costs I-premise
, I-premise
being I-premise
a I-premise
hurdle I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
development I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
thriving B-claim
economies I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
preservation I-claim
of I-claim
ecosystems I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
promoted I-claim
simultaneously I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
suppose O
the O
developed O
countries O
should O
support O
the O
underdeveloped O
areas O
by O
providing O
financial O
resources O
, O
technologies O
and O
experience O
so O
that O
the O
environmental O
problems O
can O
be O
effectively O
alleviated O
in O
these O
areas O
. O

Government O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
ARTs O
, O
not O
only O
on O
public O
services O
As O
people O
have O
raised O
their O
democratic O
awareness O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
they O
are O
caring O
more O
about O
how O
the O
tax O
expenditure O
is O
distributed O
by O
the O
government O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some O
people O
suggest O
that O
the O
tax O
money O
should O
be O
allocated O
to O
publically O
beneficial O
services O
instead O
of O
arts O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
think O
arts B-claim
are I-claim
supposed I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
included I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
's I-claim
investment I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
should I-premise
give I-premise
priority I-premise
to I-premise
public I-premise
services I-premise
and I-premise
facilities I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
the B-premise
government I-premise
plays I-premise
the I-premise
role I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
leader I-premise
among I-premise
citizens I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
should I-premise
discharge I-premise
the I-premise
responsibility I-premise
of I-premise
making I-premise
optimal I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
tax I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise

Simultaneously O
, O
public B-premise
services I-premise
such I-premise

lower I-premise
the I-premise

Therefore O

be I-claim
given I-claim
adequate I-claim

by I-claim

Individually O

Currently B-premise

people I-premise
are I-premise
increasingly I-premise
occupied I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise

studies I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
stiff I-premise
competition I-premise

Consequently O
, O
they B-premise
require I-premise
various I-premise
entertainment I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
music I-premise

movies I-premise
or I-premise
books I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise

their I-premise

release I-premise

Without B-premise

people I-premise

From O
the O

Cultural B-premise

essential I-premise

This O

In O
this O

With O
those O
arguments O
in O

I O
would O
conclude O
that O
public B-claim

an I-claim
integral I-claim

of I-claim
the I-claim

At O
the O

the B-claim

Keeping O
animals O
in O
zoos O

Since O
the O
time O
they O
were O
introduced O
zoos O
have O
both O
been O
supported O
and O
criticized O
. O

Many O
believe O
that O
zoos O
could O
be O
very O
entertaining O
and O
ecologically O
important O
, O
whereas O
, O
others O
think O
that O
keeping O
animals O
in O
captivity O
is O
totally O
wrong O
. O

Both O
sides O
will O
be O
discussed O
before O
a O
reasonable O
conclusion O
is O
drawn O
. O

First O
, O
critics O
of O
zoology O
argue O
that O
keeping B-claim
animals I-claim
in I-claim
captivity I-claim
is I-claim
wrong I-claim
because O
animals B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
considered I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
human I-premise
persons I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
of I-premise
having I-premise
freedom I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
so I-premise
unfair I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
taken I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
natural I-premise
environment I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
kept I-premise
in I-premise
small I-premise
enclosures I-premise
. O

That O
is O
because O
, O
many B-premise
zoos I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
the I-premise
ones I-premise
in I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
provide I-premise
care I-premise
and I-premise
attention I-premise
which I-premise
their I-premise
animals I-premise
require I-premise
. O

The B-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
undernourished I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
sufficient I-premise
quality I-premise
and I-premise
quantity I-premise
of I-premise
medical I-premise
treatment I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
sometimes B-premise
animals I-premise
from I-premise
hot I-premise
countries I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
survive I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
cold I-premise
winter I-premise
of I-premise
somewhere I-premise
in I-premise
Europe I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
advocators O
believe O
that O
zoos B-claim
provide I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
with I-claim
good I-claim
entertainment I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
ensure I-claim
the I-claim
balance I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
ecology I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
young I-premise
children I-premise
enjoy I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
zoos I-premise
and I-premise
see I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
animals I-premise
, I-premise
cute I-premise
baby I-premise
- I-premise
born I-premise
animals I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
animals I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
different I-premise
corners I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Zoos B-premise
provide I-premise
educational I-premise
information I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
lives I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
animals I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
zoos B-premise
play I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
reserving I-premise
many I-premise
breeds I-premise
of I-premise
animal I-premise
and I-premise
preventing I-premise
them I-premise
from I-premise
being I-premise
missing I-premise
from I-premise
life I-premise
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
in B-premise
zoos I-premise
, I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
kept I-premise
in I-premise
enclosures I-premise
which I-premise
simulate I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
habitats I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
being I-premise
protected I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
predators I-premise
or I-premise
hunters I-premise
. O

Thus O
zoos B-premise
are I-premise
needed I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
the I-premise
nature I-premise
balanced I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
both B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
arguments I-claim
have I-claim
strong I-claim
supports I-claim
, O
but O
in O
my O
own O
view O
, O
more B-claim
good I-claim
come I-claim
from I-claim
zoos I-claim
than I-claim
bad I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
the O
standards O
of O
zoos O
should O
be O
leveled O
up O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
animals O
in O
zoos O
are O
provided O
with O
good O
care O
and O
attention O

Artists O
' O
freedom O

Artists O
in O
most O
countries O
are O
given O
the O
freedom O
to O
express O
their O
thoughts O
in O
whatever O
they O
do O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
argue O
that O
there O
should O
be O
government O
restrictions O
in O
order O
to O
limit O
their O
opinions O
. O

I O
however O
, O
agree O
to O
this O
only O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
and O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
artists I-claim
must I-claim
be I-claim
given I-claim
freedom I-claim
so I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
produce I-claim
some I-claim
really I-claim
marvelous I-claim
masterpiece I-claim
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
if B-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
control I-premise
over I-premise
artists I-premise
' I-premise
ideas I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
definitely I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
creativity I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
long I-premise
run I-premise
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
when B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
given I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
artists I-premise
will I-premise
think I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
box I-premise
and I-premise
come I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
spectacular I-premise
Arts I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
paintings I-premise
or I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
paintings B-premise
by I-premise
Da I-premise
Vinci I-premise
and I-premise
Michallengo I-premise
are I-premise
admired I-premise
even I-premise
till I-premise
now I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
were I-premise
not I-premise
restricted I-premise
during I-premise
those I-premise
times I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
without B-claim
any I-claim
limitations I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
awe I-claim
inspiring I-claim
work I-claim
from I-claim
our I-claim
artists I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
every I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
right I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
voice I-premise
out I-premise
their I-premise
opinions I-premise
in I-premise
any I-premise
ways I-premise
as I-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
cause I-premise
any I-premise
problems I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
nation I-premise
. O

Today B-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
make I-premise
numerous I-premise
efforts I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
democratic I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Arts B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
ways I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
criticise I-premise
social I-premise
problems I-premise
and I-premise
government I-premise
policies I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
particular I-premise
country I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
the B-premise
famous I-premise
movie I-premise
' I-premise
3 I-premise
Idiots I-premise
' I-premise
acted I-premise
by I-premise
Amir I-premise
Khan I-premise
criticises I-premise
the I-premise
education I-premise
system I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
chiefly I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
memorising I-premise
and I-premise
not I-premise
being I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
apply I-premise
whatever I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
learn I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
human B-claim
rights I-claim
is I-claim
violated I-claim
if I-claim
artists I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
express I-claim
their I-claim
feelings I-claim
freely I-claim
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
drawbacks O
if O
artists O
are O
not O
restricted O
. O

They B-premise
might I-premise
go I-premise
deeper I-premise
into I-premise
certain I-premise
aspects I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
cause I-premise
controversies I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
Malaysia B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
multiracial I-premise
country I-premise
whereby I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
citizens I-premise
live I-premise
together I-premise
in I-premise
harmony I-premise
and I-premise
peace I-premise
. O

In B-claim
case I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
anyone I-claim
who I-claim
brings I-claim
up I-claim
some I-claim
sensitive I-claim
issues I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
films I-claim
or I-claim
books I-claim
regarding I-claim
any I-claim
races I-claim
, I-claim
this I-claim
might I-claim
end I-claim
up I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
chaos I-claim
among I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
artists B-premise
know I-premise
their I-premise
boundaries I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
and I-premise
would I-premise
surely I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
their I-premise
names I-premise
tarnished I-premise
just I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
unscrupulous I-premise
acts I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it O
is O
now O
evident O
that O
there B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
any I-claim
restrictions I-claim
on I-claim
artists I-claim
' I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Allowing B-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
freely I-premise
will I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
an I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
themselves I-premise
as O
ideas B-premise
can I-premise
naturally I-premise
flow I-premise
when I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
no I-premise
limitations I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
even B-premise
though I-premise
freedom I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
ideas I-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
some I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
, O
I O
certainly O
believe O
that O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
wonderful I-claim
and I-claim
beautiful I-claim
Arts I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
freedom I-claim
to I-claim
express I-claim
ideas I-claim
and O
thus O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
there B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
no I-claim
restrictions I-claim
on I-claim
them I-claim
. O

The O
nuclear O
power O
provide O
clean O
and O
cheap O
energy O

The O
topic O
of O
nuclear O
technology O
frequently O
generates O
a O
heated O
debate O
with O
proponents O
maintaining O
that O
nuclear O
power O
provides O
a O
source O
of O
efficient O
and O
economical O
energy O
while O
opponents O
argue O
that O
atomic O
technology O
is O
uncontrollable O
and O
very O
dangerous O
to O
handle O
. O

As O
far O
as O
my O
opinion O
is O
concerned O
, O
I B-claim
find I-claim
myself I-claim
aligned I-claim
with I-claim
opponents I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
usages I-claim
of I-claim
nuclear I-claim
power I-claim
. O

I O
have O
several O
reasons O
to O
believe O
its O
disadvantages O
outnumber O
the O
few O
advantages O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
reason O
is O
that O
pursuit B-claim
of I-claim
nuclear I-claim
technology I-claim
one I-claim
way I-claim
or I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
leads I-claim
towards I-claim
atomic I-claim
weapons I-claim
. O

Last B-premise
century I-premise
has I-premise
witnessed I-premise
the I-premise
horrors I-premise
of I-premise
such I-premise
weapons I-premise
. O

If B-premise
each I-premise
country I-premise
pursues I-premise
the I-premise
fusion I-premise
and I-premise
fission I-premise
process I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
may I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
mold I-premise
it I-premise
for I-premise
military I-premise
usage I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
to O
fortify O
my O
opinion O
is O
that O
even B-claim
civil I-claim
usages I-claim
of I-claim
atomic I-claim
power I-claim
pose I-claim
a I-claim
dire I-claim
threat I-claim
of I-claim
radio I-claim
activity I-claim
. O

For O
example O
recently B-premise
there I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
an I-premise
incident I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
an I-premise
atomic I-premise
power I-premise
house I-premise
leaked I-premise
tons I-premise
of I-premise
radio I-premise
active I-premise
material I-premise
into I-premise
air I-premise
when I-premise
an I-premise
earthquake I-premise
hit I-premise
the I-premise
surrounding I-premise
area I-premise
. O

This B-premise
unfortunate I-premise
event I-premise
proves I-premise
that I-premise
no I-premise
matter I-premise
how I-premise
much I-premise
careful I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
such I-premise
accidents I-premise
are I-premise
inevitable I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
while B-premise
generating I-premise
energy I-premise
from I-premise
any I-premise
source I-premise
be I-premise
it I-premise
hydro I-premise
power I-premise
or I-premise
oil I-premise
there I-premise
always I-premise
is I-premise
some I-premise
wastage I-premise

and I-premise
so I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
case I-premise
with I-premise
nuclear I-premise
power I-premise
. O

Safely B-claim
getting I-claim
rid I-claim
of I-claim
nuclear I-claim
waste I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
daunting I-claim
task I-claim
and I-claim
there I-claim
has I-claim
not I-claim
been I-claim
any I-claim
permanent I-claim
solution I-claim
of I-claim
it I-claim
. O

This B-premise
waste I-premise
is I-premise
many I-premise
times I-premise
more I-premise
lethal I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
environment I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
hazardous I-premise
material I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
from O
above O
mentioned O
facts O
it O
can O
easily O
be O
deduced O
that O
nuclear B-claim
power I-claim
may I-claim
appear I-claim
silver I-claim
bullet I-claim
for I-claim
energy I-claim
crisis I-claim
but I-claim
its I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
far I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

Thus O
I O
suggest O
that O
use O
of O
nuclear O
technology O
should O
be O
discouraged O
even O
for O
civil O
purposes O
. O

Giving O
mobile O
phones O
to O
the O
unemployed O
Today O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
unemployment O
is O
on O
the O
rise O
and O
is O
seriously O
being O
debated O
by O
many O
. O

Some O
opine O
that O
the O
best O
method O
to O
minimize O
this O
problem O
is O
by O
providing O
the O
unemployed O
with O
hand O
phones O
that O
have O
access O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O

They O
also O
believe O
that O
this O
solution O
is O
the O
most O
appropriate O
way O
to O
utilize O
the O
public O
money O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
agree O
to O
this O
solution O
only O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
because O
I O
feel O
that O
giving B-claim
those I-claim
with I-claim
no I-claim
work I-claim
a I-claim
mobile I-claim
phone I-claim
each I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
total I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
. O

In O
a O
positive O
point O
of O
view O
, O
when B-premise
people I-premise
without I-premise
jobs I-premise
have I-premise
hand I-premise
phones I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise

they I-premise

found I-premise
apart I-premise
from I-premise
looking I-premise
up I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
prepare I-premise
themselves I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the B-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
calls I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
companies I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
with I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
if B-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
provides I-claim
those I-claim
without I-claim
work I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
mobile I-claim
phone I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
themselves I-claim
an I-claim
occupation I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
and I-claim
survive I-claim
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
supplying B-premise
hand I-premise
phones I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
unemployed I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
taxpayers I-premise
' I-premise
money I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
the B-premise
money I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
supply I-premise
the I-premise
electronic I-premise
gadget I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
useful I-premise
purposes I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
the B-premise
money I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
build I-premise
more I-premise
amenities I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
or I-premise
given I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
poor I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
it I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
earn I-premise
a I-premise
living I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the B-claim
money I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
used I-claim
for I-claim
other I-claim
intentions I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
giving I-claim
hand I-claim
phones I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
unemployed I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
when B-claim
hand I-claim
phones I-claim
are I-claim
provided I-claim
for I-claim
free I-claim
, I-claim
many I-claim
would I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
opportunity I-claim
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
surprising I-premise
that I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
obtain I-premise
a I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
make I-premise
themselves I-premise
jobless I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
might I-premise
even I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
extent I-premise
of I-premise
lying I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
on I-premise
unemployment I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
eligible I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
phones I-premise
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
the B-premise
public I-premise
's I-premise
money I-premise
is I-premise
spent I-premise
worthlessly I-premise
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
till B-claim
now I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
no I-claim
surveys I-claim
or I-claim
evidences I-claim
that I-claim
prove I-claim
this I-claim
method I-claim
in I-claim
effective I-claim
in I-claim
reducing I-claim
the I-claim
rate I-claim
of I-claim
unemployment I-claim
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the O
suggestion O
of O
providing B-claim
those I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
jobless I-claim
with I-claim
mobile I-claim
phones I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
accessible I-claim
to I-claim
internet I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
proper I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
trim I-claim
down I-claim
the I-claim
rate I-claim
of I-claim
unemployment I-claim
. O

I O
suggest O
the O
government O
look O
into O
the O
background O
of O
the O
people O
in O
depth O
before O
giving O
out O
hand O
phones O
to O
them O
. O

I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the O
public O
money O
should O
be O
utilized O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
society O
and O
not O
just O
for O
some O
of O
them O
who O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
put O
in O
more O
effort O
to O
find O
them O
a O
proper O
work O
. O

Use O
of O
CCTV O
cameras O
Today O
, O
close O
circuit O
television O
( O
CCTV O
) O
cameras O
are O
widely O
used O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
circumstances O
. O

They O
are O
used O
in O
schools O
, O
businesses O
and O
some O
other O
premises O
in O
order O
to O
monitor O
the O
activities O
taking O
place O
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the O
use O
of O
CCTV O
has O
plenty O
of O
benefits O
to O
offer O
, O
especially O
in O
reducing O
crimes O
and O
protecting O
the O
employees O
in O
a O
premise O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
argue O
that O
these O
cameras O
invade O
their O
privacies O
due O
to O
constantly O
being O
monitored O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
CCTV B-claim
cameras I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
installed I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
premise I-claim
to I-claim
combat I-claim
the I-claim
ever I-claim
increasing I-claim
theft I-claim
rate I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
the I-claim
workers I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
workplace I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
by B-premise
having I-premise
CCTV I-premise
cameras I-premise
at I-premise
workplace I-premise
, I-premise
crimes I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
robbery I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
trimmed I-premise
down I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
when B-premise
a I-premise
shop I-premise
is I-premise
attacked I-premise
by I-premise
thieves I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
clips I-premise
taken I-premise
by I-premise
these I-premise
cameras I-premise
serve I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
evidence I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
the I-premise
thieves I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
traced I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
in B-premise
Malaysia I-premise
, I-premise
policemen I-premise
used I-premise
the I-premise
videos I-premise
captured I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
CCTV I-premise
cameras I-premise
to I-premise
trace I-premise
and I-premise
successfully I-premise
catch I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
robbers I-premise
who I-premise
broke I-premise
into I-premise
a I-premise
Seven I-premise
Eleven I-premise
shop I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
midnight I-premise
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
as B-premise
the I-premise
employees I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
under I-premise
constant I-premise
surveillance I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
less I-premise
likely I-premise
steal I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
shops I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
CCTVs B-claim
must I-claim
be I-claim
put I-claim
in I-claim
all I-claim
workplace I-claim
so I-claim
that I-claim
crime I-claim
rates I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
minimized I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
at B-premise
some I-premise
offices I-premise
, I-premise
employees I-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
required I-premise
to I-premise
handle I-premise
angry I-premise
or I-premise
frustrated I-premise
customers I-premise
. O

At O
times O
, O
face B-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
interactions I-premise
with I-premise
an I-premise
annoyed I-premise
customer I-premise
can I-premise
put I-premise
the I-premise
employee I-premise
in I-premise
physical I-premise
danger I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
the B-premise
installation I-premise
of I-premise
CCTV I-premise
cameras I-premise
may I-premise
help I-premise
the I-premise
employees I-premise
escape I-premise
this I-premise
situation I-premise
because O
the B-premise
customers I-premise
know I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
that I-premise
their I-premise
conversations I-premise
are I-premise
recorded I-premise
. O

In O
the O
event O
of O
an O
argument O
, O
the B-premise
videotapes I-premise
can I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
determine I-premise
what I-premise
actually I-premise
took I-premise
place I-premise
and I-premise
further I-premise
actions I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
then I-premise
taken I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
these B-claim
cameras I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
some I-claim
form I-claim
of I-claim
protection I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
workers I-claim
against I-claim
the I-claim
customers I-claim
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
the O
use O
of O
CCTV O
cameras O
does O
cause O
controversy O
. O

Those B-claim
opposing I-claim
the I-claim
CCTV I-claim
systems I-claim
feel I-claim
that I-claim
their I-claim
privacies I-claim
are I-claim
invaded I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
constant I-claim
monitoring I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
cameras I-claim
. O

However O
, O
one B-premise
must I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
safety I-premise
is I-premise
of I-premise
paramount I-premise
importance I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
privacy I-premise
and I-premise
prevention I-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
better I-premise
than I-premise
suffering I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
consequences I-premise
. O

Ergo O
, O
opponents B-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
system I-premise
should I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
comprehend I-premise
the I-premise
situation I-premise
and I-premise
take I-premise
actions I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
themselves I-premise
from I-premise
being I-premise
victims I-premise
of I-premise
crime I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
CCTV B-claim
cameras I-claim
are I-claim
essential I-claim
and I-claim
therefore I-claim
must I-claim
be I-claim
installed I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
premise I-claim
. O

This B-claim
is I-claim
chiefly I-claim
to I-claim
shield I-claim
oneself I-claim
from I-claim
being I-claim
harmed I-claim
by I-claim
any I-claim
intruders I-claim
or I-claim
robbers I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
privacies B-premise
are I-premise
lost I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
cameras I-premise
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
safety B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
put I-premise
first I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
safe I-premise
. O

Some O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
a O
company O
, O
some O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
themselves O

There O
are O
many O
kinds O
of O
jobs O
in O
society O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
done O
by O
companies O
that O
related O
to O
government O
, O
and O
some O
of O
them O
are O
done O
by O
privat O
companies O
. O

Although O
both O
companies O
have O
their O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
myself I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
my I-claim
own I-claim
business I-claim
. O

There O
are O
many O
benefits O
when O
people O
work O
for O
themselves O
rather O
than O
work O
for O
the O
others O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
opportunities I-claim
in I-claim
privat I-claim
works I-claim
that I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
find I-claim
them I-claim
when I-claim
you I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
others I-claim
. O

In B-premise
your I-premise
job I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
boss I-premise
of I-premise
yourself I-premise
; I-premise
however I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
jobs I-premise
someone I-premise
else I-premise
are I-premise
your I-premise
boss I-premise
. O

You B-premise
always I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
responsible I-premise
for I-premise
your I-premise
task I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
stressful I-premise
situation I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
never I-premise
like I-premise
it I-premise
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
when B-claim
people I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
themselves I-claim
they I-claim
make I-claim
more I-claim
profit I-claim
for I-claim
themselves I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
jobs I-claim
you I-claim
make I-claim
profits I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
your I-claim
manager I-claim
. O

Unfortunately O
nowadays B-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
pick I-premise
up I-premise
this I-premise
profit I-premise
without I-premise
sharing I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
sum I-premise
of I-premise
it I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
workers I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
point I-premise
of I-premise
view I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
unfair I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
authorities I-claim
in I-claim
privat I-claim
jobs I-claim
that I-claim
workers I-claim
are I-claim
always I-claim
looking I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
while I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
working I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
others I-claim
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
work I-premise
for I-premise
yourself I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
punch I-premise
in I-premise
and I-premise
punch I-premise
out I-premise
whenever I-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
some I-premise
occasions I-premise
happen I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
a I-premise
disease I-premise
, I-premise
sticking I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
traffic I-premise
jam I-premise
and I-premise
sometime I-premise
going I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
vacation I-premise
. O

For B-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
ask I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
permission I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
allowed I-premise
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
working B-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
, O
too O
, O
but O
I O
imagine O
people B-claim
that I-claim
have I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
business I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
comfortable I-claim
. O

They B-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
opportunities I-claim
, I-claim
profits I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
authorities I-claim
. O

The O
expression O
" O
Never O
, O
never O
give O
up O
" O
means O
keep O
trying O
and O
never O
stop O
working O
Many O
individuals O
throughout O
their O
life O
face O
with O
at O
least O
one O
failure O
in O
different O
areas O
such O
as O
education O
, O
love O
and O
economy O
. O

Some O
believe O
when O
a O
person O
faces O
with O
a O
failure O
the O
best O
way O
is O
to O
forget O
that O
and O
releases O
that O
; O
however O
, O
I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
this O
idea O
. O

I O
always O
believe O
that O
a B-claim
defeated I-claim
person I-claim
has I-claim
to I-claim
try I-claim
and I-claim
try I-claim
until I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
her I-claim
or I-claim
his I-claim
goal I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when B-claim
people I-claim
face I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
failure I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
things I-claim
from I-claim
that I-claim
failure I-claim
, I-claim
therefore I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
next I-claim
effort I-claim
they I-claim
try I-claim
to I-claim
avoid I-claim
doing I-claim
and I-claim
repeating I-claim
that I-claim
mistakes I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
most B-premise
of I-premise
inventors I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
phases I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
face I-premise
with I-premise
some I-premise
problems I-premise
and I-premise
defeats I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
next I-premise
stages I-premise
they I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
experience B-claim
shows I-claim
while I-claim
people I-claim
doing I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
constantly I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
become I-claim
more I-claim
experienced I-claim
in I-claim
that I-claim
subject I-claim
, I-claim
so I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
final I-claim
effort I-claim
they I-claim
become I-claim
successful I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
high I-claim
percentile I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
scientists B-premise
experiment I-premise
a I-premise
substance I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
after I-premise
they I-premise
gain I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
experience I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
that I-premise
subject I-premise
they I-premise
decide I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
it I-premise
final I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
maintain O
that O
people B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
give I-claim
up I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
face I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
failure I-claim
. O

In O
opposite O
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
new I-claim
points I-claim
from I-claim
that I-claim
failure I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
become I-claim
more I-claim
experienced I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
human O
needs O
for O
farmland O
, O
housing O
and O
industry O
are O
more O
Nowadays O
there O
are O
some O
issues O
which O
many O
countries O
and O
nations O
are O
concern O
about O
that O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
most O
important O
of O
them O
are O
rate O
of O
increasing O
population O
and O
endangered O
plants O
and O
animals O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
although O
endangered B-claim
animals I-claim
are I-claim
important I-claim
, O
human B-claim
needs I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
considered I-claim
more I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
day B-premise
by I-premise
day I-premise
population I-premise
is I-premise
increasing I-premise
, O
so O
human B-premise
needs I-premise
for I-premise
food I-premise
is I-premise
increasing I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

We B-premise
need I-premise
farmland I-premise
to I-premise
grow I-premise
crops I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
wheat I-premise
and I-premise
corn I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
doubt I-premise
that I-premise
without I-premise
food I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
alive I-premise
for I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
some I-premise
weeks I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
farmlands B-claim
are I-claim
vital I-claim
for I-claim
human I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
people B-premise
need I-premise
shelters I-premise
to I-premise
protect I-premise
themselves I-premise
from I-premise
mother I-premise
nature I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
wind I-premise
and I-premise
flood I-premise
and I-premise
wild I-premise
animals I-premise
, O
so O
they B-claim
need I-claim
land I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
their I-claim
houses I-claim
on I-claim
it I-claim
. O

Dwelling B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
human I-premise
needs I-premise
after I-premise
food I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
undeniable I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
human B-premise
need I-premise
some I-premise
crucial I-premise
things I-premise
to I-premise
continue I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
industrial I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
medicine I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
some B-claim
lands I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
assigned I-claim
to I-claim
industry I-claim
. O

Todays B-premise
life I-premise
has I-premise
some I-premise
difficulty I-premise
which I-premise
become I-premise
comfortable I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
industry I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the B-premise
population I-premise
of I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
than I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
population I-premise
, O
so O
they B-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
need I-claim
so I-claim
much I-claim
land I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
need I-claim
. O

I O
would O
maintain O
that O
nowadays B-claim
humans I-claim
need I-claim
farmland I-claim
, I-claim
housing I-claim
and I-claim
industry I-claim
because O
of O
increasing B-claim
population I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
than I-claim
saving I-claim
land I-claim
for I-claim
endangered I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

Best O
way O
to O
judge O
about O
people O
is O
to O
be O
familiar O
with O
their O
personality O
- O
not O
with O
their O
look O

Individuals O
have O
two O
features O
, O
one O
of O
them O
is O
appearance O
and O
the O
other O
one O
is O
personality O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
although B-claim
appearance I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
, O
personality B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
. O

We B-claim
can I-claim
never I-claim
judge I-claim
about I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
with I-claim
his I-claim
or I-claim
her I-claim
appearance I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
believes O
, O
individuals O
who O
have O
black O
skin O
or O
are O
frown O
are O
not O
good O
person O
and O
in O
opposite O
individuals O
who O
have O
pale O
or O
white O
skin O
or O
always O
have O
smile O
on O
their O
face O
are O
good O
person O
. O

I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
these O
kind O
of O
judgement O
which O
someone O
makes O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
play I-premise
a I-premise
role I-premise
and I-premise
cheat I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
individuals I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
playing I-premise
, O
therefore O
we B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
aware I-claim
to I-claim
never I-claim
judge I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
appearance I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
cheat I-premise
their I-premise
fiance I-premise
before I-premise
marriage I-premise
by I-premise
showing I-premise
a I-premise
cheerful I-premise
face I-premise
and I-premise
well I-premise
spoken I-premise
; I-premise
however I-premise
, I-premise
after I-premise
getting I-premise
marriage I-premise
they I-premise
show I-premise
their I-premise
real I-premise
personality I-premise
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
black I-claim
skin I-claim
, I-claim
fat I-claim
and I-claim
frown I-claim
, I-claim
nonetheless I-claim
they I-claim
might I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
person I-claim
for I-claim
leaving I-claim
and I-claim
colleague I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
neighbor I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
old I-premise
, I-premise
black I-premise
skin I-premise
and I-premise
frown I-premise

and I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
always I-premise
panicked I-premise
of I-premise
her I-premise
. O

One B-premise
day I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
cold I-premise
winter I-premise
while I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
getting I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
home I-premise
from I-premise
school I-premise

I I-premise
realized I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
lost I-premise
my I-premise
keys I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
do I-premise
anything I-premise
before I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
getting I-premise
back I-premise
home I-premise
. O

She B-premise
asked I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
stay I-premise
with I-premise
her I-premise
till I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
come I-premise
, I-premise
also I-premise
she I-premise
was I-premise
great I-premise
in I-premise
hospitality I-premise
and I-premise
her I-premise
behavior I-premise
was I-premise
unforgettable I-premise
. O

After O
that O
I O
understood O
, O
I B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
never I-premise
judge I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
appearance I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the B-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
judge I-claim
about I-claim
individuals I-claim
' I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
familiar I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
personality I-claim
not I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
appearance I-claim
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
people O
play O
role O
to O
cheat O
the O
others O
, O
and O
they O
try O
to O
hide O
their O
real O
personality O
with O
their O
appearance O
. O

should O
one O
follow O
fashion O
trends O
rather O
than O
a O
personal O
style O
? O

With O
increasing O
availability O
to O
the O
Internet O
, O
people O
can O
collect O
a O
wealth O
of O
information O
about O
the O
latest O
fashion O
trends O
over O
the O
world O
, O
such O
as O
the O
most O
popular O
shoes O
style O
this O
season O
or O
the O
best O
- O
liked O
clothes O
color O
this O
year O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
that O
dressing O
in O
a O
personal O
style O
should O
be O
advocated O
rather O
than O
following O
fashion O
trends O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
fashion B-claim
trends I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
essential I-claim
role I-claim
to I-claim
play I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
lives I-claim
than I-claim
personal I-claim
dressing I-claim
styles I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
following B-claim
fashion I-claim
trends I-claim
enables I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
up I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
's I-claim
latest I-claim
transformations I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
of I-claim
vital I-claim
importance I-claim
if I-claim
we I-claim
consider I-claim
the I-claim
fact I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
global I-claim
village I-claim
today I-claim
. O

When B-premise
individuals I-premise
keep I-premise
the I-premise
habit I-premise
of I-premise
grasping I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
's I-premise
cutting I-premise
- I-premise
edge I-premise
fashion I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
gradually I-premise
changing I-premise
their I-premise
attitudes I-premise
to I-premise
viewing I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
means I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
open I-premise
to I-premise
accept I-premise
diverse I-premise
voices I-premise
from I-premise
people I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if B-premise
they I-premise
stuck I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
fashion I-premise
styles I-premise
, I-premise
disregarding I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
's I-premise
top I-premise
fashion I-premise
designers I-premise

achievements I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
stay I-premise
conservative I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
worlds I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they B-premise
might I-premise
fall I-premise
behind I-premise
shortly I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
people B-premise
with I-premise
inadequate I-premise
aesthetic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
or I-premise
poor I-premise
originality I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
senses I-premise

when I-premise
treasuring I-premise
the I-premise
latest I-premise
fashion I-premise
information I-premise
. O

Without B-claim
following I-claim
fashion I-claim
trends I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
people I-claim
would I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
hard I-claim
time I-claim
choosing I-claim

matching I-claim
clothes I-claim
, I-claim
let I-claim
alone I-claim
forming I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
dressing I-claim
styles I-claim
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
following B-premise
fashion I-premise
trends I-premise
constantly I-premise
may I-premise
undermine I-premise
individuals I-premise

personalities I-premise

Individuals B-premise
purchase I-premise
their I-premise
clothes I-premise
according I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise

which I-premise
may I-premise
result I-premise

the I-premise
phenomenon I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
wear I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise

Consequently O
, O
the B-claim
world I-claim
would I-claim
look I-claim
monotonous I-claim
. O

With O
those O
arguments O
in O
mind O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
people B-claim

, I-claim
especially I-claim
for I-claim
ones I-claim

state I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
totally I-claim
right I-claim
decision I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
because O
the B-premise
cost I-premise
of I-premise
treatment I-premise
is I-premise
often I-premise
much I-premise
higher I-premise
than I-premise
that I-premise
of I-premise
prevention I-premise
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
our I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
budget I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
we B-claim
should I-claim
give I-claim
more I-claim
priority I-claim
to I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
preventative I-claim
measures I-claim
than I-claim
to I-claim
treatment I-claim
. O

However O
, O
reasonable B-claim
attentions I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
paid I-claim
to I-claim
treatment I-claim
so I-claim
that I-claim
our I-claim
citizens I-claim
are I-claim
always I-claim
looked I-claim
after I-claim
with I-claim
best I-claim
services I-claim
. O

The O
popularity O
of O
news O
media O
Nowadays O
news O
media O
have O
become O
more O
and O
more O
popular O
. O

Many O
people O
consider O
that O
the O
drawbacks O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
outweigh O
its O
merits O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
this O
idea O
is O
not O
completely O
true O
. O

It O
is O
widely O
seen O
that O
news B-claim
media I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
brings I-claim
people I-claim
entertainment I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
polishes I-claim
up I-claim
people I-claim
' I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
not O
unreasonable O
to O
suggest O
that O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
development O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
today B-premise
entertainment I-premise
is I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
than I-premise
ever I-premise
before I-premise
. O

The B-premise
fact I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
such I-premise
news I-premise
media I-premise
as I-premise
televisions I-premise
, I-premise
radios I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
newspapers I-premise
are I-premise
bringing I-premise
many I-premise
news I-premise
on I-premise
entertainment I-premise
sector I-premise
from I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
to I-premise
everybody I-premise
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
sit I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
televisions I-premise
and I-premise
watch I-premise
whatever I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
, I-premise
from I-premise
musical I-premise
concerts I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
football I-premise
match I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
convenient I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
relaxation I-premise
after I-premise
hard I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
the B-claim
popularity I-claim
of I-claim
news I-claim
media I-claim
is I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
news B-claim
media I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
broaden I-claim
their I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
clearly I-premise
seen I-premise
that I-premise
mass I-premise
media I-premise
provide I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
global I-premise

on I-premise
all I-premise
fields I-premise

including I-premise
political I-premise
situation I-premise
, I-premise
economic I-premise
change I-premise
, I-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
forth I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
strong I-premise
likelihood I-premise
that I-premise
today I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
better I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
particularly I-premise
essential I-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
globalization I-premise
process I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
permeating I-premise
into I-premise
all I-premise
areas I-premise

Indeed O
, O
the B-premise
fast I-premise
growth I-premise
of I-premise
news I-premise

is I-premise
helpful I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
worldwide I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
news I-claim
media I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
making I-claim
great I-claim
inroads I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim

all I-claim

. O

It B-premise
relaxes I-premise
people I-premise

plentiful I-premise

It B-premise
enriches I-premise
people I-premise

. O

It B-premise
also I-premise
positively I-premise
affects I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
people I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
other I-premise
aspects I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
progress I-claim
of I-claim
news I-claim
media I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
advantageous I-claim
development I-claim
. O

Jury O
must O
have O
access O
to O
criminals O
' O
past O
records O

It O
is O
a O
well O
known O
fact O
that O
a O
jury O
involved O
in O
a O
case O
has O
no O
information O
regarding O
the O
criminal O
's O
past O
illegal O
acts O
under O
the O
British O
and O
Australian O
laws O
. O

There O
are O
few O
of O
those O
who O
are O
concerned O
think O
the O
current O
practice O
should O
be O
altered O
and O
that O
the B-claim
juries I-claim
should I-claim
at I-claim
least I-claim
know I-claim
something I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
criminals I-claim
before I-claim
coming I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
conclusion I-claim
. O

I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
agree O
to O
this O
resolution O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
as O
it O
poses O
advantages O
to O
various O
parties O
as O
I O
shall O
discuss O
below O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
easier I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
juries I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
decision I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
know I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
information I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
criminal I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
, O
knowing B-premise
their I-premise
background I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
will I-premise
enable I-premise
the I-premise
juries I-premise
to I-premise
analyze I-premise
the I-premise
crime I-premise
before I-premise
coming I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
judgment I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
take B-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
has I-premise
not I-premise
murdered I-premise
anyone I-premise
but I-premise
is I-premise
suddenly I-premise
found I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
guilty I-premise
. O

The B-premise
juries I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
weather I-premise
the I-premise
individual I-premise
committed I-premise
the I-premise
crime I-premise
intentionally I-premise
or I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
circumstances I-premise
by I-premise
knowing I-premise
the I-premise
facts I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
person I-premise
. O

Then O
, O
punishment B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
given I-premise
in I-premise
accordance I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
condition I-premise
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
a B-premise
fair I-premise
trial I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
achieved I-premise
. O

As O
all O
of O
us O
know O
, O
juries B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
or I-premise
less I-premise
knowledge I-premise
regarding I-premise
law I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
exposing B-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
records I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
criminal I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
room I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
rationally I-premise
and I-premise
finally I-premise
put I-premise
the I-premise
pieces I-premise
together I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
produce I-premise
a I-premise
more I-premise
meaningful I-premise
decision I-premise
. O

By O
doing O
so O
, O
the B-premise
juries I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
relief I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
come I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
better I-premise
conclusion I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
evidences I-premise
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the B-claim
convicted I-claim
will I-claim
also I-claim
receive I-claim
a I-claim
fair I-claim
action I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
when B-claim
the I-claim
background I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
convicted I-claim
is I-claim
' I-claim
dug I-claim
' I-claim
deeper I-claim
and I-claim
is I-claim
revealed I-claim
to I-claim
mass I-claim
of I-claim
anonymous I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
his I-claim
privacy I-claim
is I-claim
being I-claim
jeopardized I-claim
. O

If B-premise
finally I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
proven I-premise
innocent I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
may I-premise
feel I-premise
embarrassed I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
the B-premise
crimes I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
criminals I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
brought I-premise
to I-premise
light I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
it I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
victim I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
definitely O
feel O
that O
the B-claim
current I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
juries I-claim
judging I-claim
the I-claim
case I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
transformed I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
should I-claim
know I-claim
the I-claim
facts I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
criminals I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
dealing I-claim
with I-claim
. O

This O
is O
of O
paramount O
importance O
so O
that O
they B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
give I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
and I-claim
reliable I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
fair I-claim
judgment I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
convicted I-claim
. O

Beneficial O
changes O
will O
certainly O
take O
place O
if O
changes O
are O
made O
because O
for O
a O
change O
to O
happen O
, O
changes O
have O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Taking O
a O
break O
before O
starting O
higher O
education O
is O
a O
good O
idea O

Nowadays O
, O
it O
is O
an O
increasingly O
common O
trend O
to O
take O
a O
break O
before O
starting O
university O
studies O
. O

It O
is O
not O
just O
becoming O
common O
among O
rich O
students O
but O
also O
in O
the O
poor O
students O
. O

Students O
take O
a O
break O
of O
year O
or O
two O
, O
some O
students O
travel O
all O
around O
the O
world O
during O
this O
time O
, O
and O
some O
choose O
to O
take O
up O
a O
job O
. O

Experience B-claim
gained I-claim
through I-claim
traveling I-claim
to I-claim
different I-claim
places I-claim
, I-claim
meeting I-claim
different I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
even I-claim
at I-claim
job I-claim
goes I-claim
long I-claim
way I-claim
. O

It B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
enhances I-premise
the I-premise
confidence I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
independent I-premise
. O

Student B-premise
's I-premise
who I-premise
works I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
gather I-premise
better I-premise
financial I-premise
resources I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
rely I-premise
on I-premise
during I-premise
their I-premise
university I-premise
studies I-premise
. O

This B-premise
experience I-premise
also I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
. O

They B-premise
develop I-premise
broader I-premise
view I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
choice I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
studies I-premise
or I-premise
courses I-premise
. O

Taking B-claim
a I-claim
break I-claim
not I-claim
just I-claim
has I-claim
benefits I-claim
but I-claim
it I-claim
also I-claim
comes I-claim
with I-claim
some I-claim
negative I-claim
impacts I-claim
. O

Once B-premise
student I-premise
's I-premise
starts I-premise
earning I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
studies I-premise
where I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
financial I-premise
independence I-premise
. O

They B-premise
might I-premise
even I-premise
find I-premise
it I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
adapt I-premise
to I-premise
education I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

There B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
risk I-premise
of I-premise
student I-premise
never I-premise
going I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
university I-premise
or I-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Probably B-premise
some I-premise
might I-premise
take I-premise
some I-premise
short I-premise
term I-premise
courses I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
proper I-premise
and I-premise
complete I-premise
university I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
will I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
job I-premise
and I-premise
salaries I-premise
. O

This B-premise
might I-premise
only I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
run I-premise
as I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
known I-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
reasonable I-premise
career I-premise
in I-premise
longer I-premise
runs I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
needs I-premise
a I-premise
proper I-premise
and I-premise
higher I-premise
qualification I-premise
. O

In O
my O
view O
point O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
agree I-claim
to I-claim
idea I-claim
of I-claim
taking I-claim
a I-claim
break I-claim
before I-claim
starting I-claim
higher I-claim
education I-claim
. O

Students B-claim
who I-claim
take I-claim
break I-claim
, I-claim
gain I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
benefits I-claim
by I-claim
traveling I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim
places I-claim
or I-claim
by I-claim
working I-claim
. O

They B-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
contribute I-premise
more I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
experiences I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
mature I-premise
. O

University O
education O
is O
needed O
for O
success O
In O
today O
's O
modern O
and O
competitive O
society O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
we O
must O
equip O
ourselves O
with O
plenty O
of O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
in O
order O
to O
shine O
and O
to O
be O
successful O
in O
life O
. O

Many O
opine O
that O
the O
aforementioned O
aspects O
are O
mostly O
obtained O
through O
learning O
in O
academic O
institutions O
. O

I O
do O
agree O
to O
that O
opinion O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
one B-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
shine I-claim
without I-claim
even I-claim
having I-claim
to I-claim
attend I-claim
universities I-claim
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
certainly I-claim
true I-claim
that I-claim
university I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
of I-claim
paramount I-claim
importance I-claim
for I-claim
certain I-claim
professions I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
doctor I-claim
, I-claim
engineer I-claim
and I-claim
lawyer I-claim
. O

Without B-premise
proper I-premise
training I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
impossible I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
perform I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
careers I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
share I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
network I-premise
for I-premise
business I-premise
associates I-premise
and I-premise
partners I-premise
. O

This B-premise
can I-premise
benefit I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
future I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
intend I-premise
to I-premise
open I-premise
up I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
companies I-premise
or I-premise
hospitals I-premise
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
a I-claim
significant I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
very I-claim
successful I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
fields I-claim
without I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
university I-claim
. O

Take B-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
start I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
business I-premise
. O

These B-premise
people I-premise
depend I-premise
solely I-premise
on I-premise
hard I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
luck I-premise
. O

Interestingly O
, O
for B-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
it I-premise
proved I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
profitable I-premise
job I-premise
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
Michael B-premise
Dell I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
founder I-premise

Eventually O

natural I-premise
talents I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
most I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
excel I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
especially I-premise
true I-premise
in I-premise
sectors I-premise
like I-premise
entertainment I-premise
and I-premise
sports I-premise
. O

The B-premise
introduction I-premise
of I-premise
increasing I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
reality I-premise
shows I-premise
have I-premise
made I-premise
it I-premise
possible I-premise
for I-premise
all I-premise
those I-premise
lucky I-premise
ones I-premise
to I-premise
triumph I-premise
. O

To O

David B-premise
Archuleta I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
once I-premise
a I-premise
nobody I-premise

now I-premise
taken I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
space I-premise
in I-premise
hearts I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
individuals B-claim
born I-claim
with I-claim
talents I-claim
have I-claim
also I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
successful I-claim
. O

To O
wrap O
it O
all O
up O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
indeed I-claim
true I-claim
that I-claim
university I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
pivotal I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
for I-claim
one I-claim
to I-claim
prosper I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
wrong I-claim
to I-claim
say I-claim
that I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
success I-claim
completely I-claim
depends I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
education I-claim
he I-claim

at I-claim
the I-claim
institutions I-claim
. O

Natural O

Should O
people O
be O
forced O
to O
stop O
working O
? O

The O
appropriate O
age O
at O
which O
a O
person O
should O
stop O
working O
is O
now O
a O
much O
debated O
issue O
in O
the O
society O

Some O
opine O
that O
people O

be O
given O
the O
option O
to O
choose O
when O
they O
want O
to O
call O
it O
a O
day O
while O
others O
oppose O
this O
notion O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the B-claim
right I-claim
age I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
to I-claim
retire I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
around I-claim
60 I-claim
years I-claim
old I-claim
. O

I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
strongly B-claim
agree I-claim
that I-claim
age I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
set I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
criterion I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
retire I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
aforementioned I-claim
age I-claim
due O
to O
several O
reasons O
that O
I O
shall O
discuss O
below O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
if B-premise
senior I-premise
workers I-premise
dominate I-premise
the I-premise
working I-premise
sector I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
lesser I-premise
job I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
fresh I-premise
graduates I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
most B-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
forced I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
up I-claim
careers I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
poles I-claim
apart I-claim
from I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
had I-claim
studied I-claim
for I-claim
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
a B-premise
medical I-premise
graduate I-premise
might I-premise
find I-premise
it I-premise
very I-premise
disheartened I-premise
when I-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
around I-premise
five I-premise
precious I-premise
years I-premise
studying I-premise
medicine I-premise
and I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
up I-premise
another I-premise
profession I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
doctor I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
insufficient I-premise
job I-premise
opportunities I-premise
available I-premise
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
due B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
genuine I-premise
passion I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
which I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
option I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
possibility I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
performance I-premise
standard I-premise
to I-premise
dwindle I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
workplace I-premise
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
not B-premise
all I-premise
elderly I-premise
workers I-premise
are I-premise
physically I-premise
well I-premise
. O

Beyond B-premise
that I-premise
age I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
elevated I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
contracting I-premise
a I-premise
multitude I-premise
of I-premise
health I-premise
problems I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
stress I-premise
related I-premise
diseases I-premise
and I-premise
cardiovascular I-premise
illnesses I-premise
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
the B-premise
stressful I-premise
life I-premise
that I-premise
an I-premise
aged I-premise
teacher I-premise
goes I-premise
through I-premise
will I-premise
definitely I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
toll I-premise
on I-premise
him I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
in I-premise
whatever I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
doing I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
the B-premise
academic I-premise
institution I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
his I-premise
medical I-premise
bills I-premise
, I-premise
resulting I-premise
in I-premise
more I-premise
loss I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
institution I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
indeed I-claim
be I-claim
better I-claim
if I-claim
at I-claim
an I-claim
older I-claim
age I-claim
, I-claim
opportunities I-claim
are I-claim
given I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
younger I-claim
ones I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-claim
expertise I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
senior I-claim
workers I-claim
who I-claim
had I-claim
retired I-claim
should I-claim
never I-claim
be I-claim
underestimated I-claim
. O

Their B-premise
invaluable I-premise
experiences I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
respective I-premise
fields I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
engineering I-premise
, I-premise
medicine I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
law I-premise
can I-premise
certainly I-premise
be I-premise
beneficial I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
younger I-premise
generation I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
highly I-premise
recommended I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
retiree I-premise
come I-premise
over I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
companies I-premise
or I-premise
hospitals I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
regular I-premise
sessions I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
present I-premise
staffs I-premise
to I-premise
bridge I-premise
the I-premise
gap I-premise
between I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
pass I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
indeed I-claim
evident I-claim
that I-claim
age I-claim
limit I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
set I-claim
for I-claim
retirement I-claim
. O

There O
will O
come O
a O
certain O
time O
when O
the O
older O
generation O
should O
hand O
over O
the O
responsibility O
to O
the O
fresh O
comers O
who O
are O
certainly O
waiting O
to O
be O
given O
a O
choice O
to O
prove O
themselves O
. O

After O
all O
, O
retirement O
not O
only O
marks O
the O
end O
of O
an O
individual O
, O
but O
also O
gives O
him O
a O
chance O
to O
make O
up O
for O
what O
he O
has O
lost O
throughout O
his O
working O
life O
. O

Are O
museums O
necessary O
? O

I O
believe O
public B-claim
museums I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
galleries I-claim
will I-claim
still I-claim
be I-claim
necessary I-claim
, O
even O
though O
we B-claim
can I-claim
see I-claim
the I-claim
art I-claim
works I-claim
and I-claim
historical I-claim
objects I-claim
online I-claim
. O

Most B-claim
people I-claim
nowadays I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
the I-claim
Internet I-claim
to I-claim
search I-claim
for I-claim
art I-claim
work I-claim
because O
the B-premise
Internet I-premise
really I-premise
brings I-premise
them I-premise
convenience I-premise
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
browse I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
work I-premise
from I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
. O

However O
, O
people B-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
spiritual I-premise
experience I-premise
since O
pictures B-premise
online I-premise
are I-premise
only I-premise
limited I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise

size I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
the B-premise

in I-premise
museums I-premise

all I-premise

For O

only B-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise

we I-premise

In B-claim
order I-claim

to I-claim
learn I-claim
more I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
exhibits I-claim

you I-premise

Seeing B-claim
an I-claim
art I-claim
work I-claim

not I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim

by I-claim
your I-claim
own I-claim
eyes I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you B-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
see I-premise
the I-premise
texture I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
artwork I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
the I-premise
skills I-premise
used I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
artist I-premise
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
not B-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
details I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
artwork I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
shown I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
computer I-premise
screen I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
details I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
dim I-premise
since O
the B-premise
resolution I-premise
ratio I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
screen I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
high I-premise
enough I-premise
. O

These B-premise
may I-premise
influence I-premise
the I-premise
comprehension I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
work I-premise
or I-premise
historical I-premise
objects I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
we B-claim
still I-claim
need I-claim
museums I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
galleries I-claim
but O
computers B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
introduced I-claim
to I-claim
museums I-claim
and I-claim
galleries I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim

about I-claim

Should O
the O
cost O
of O
medicines O
be O
reduced O
? O

At O
present O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
patients O
in O
poor O
countries O
are O
suffering O
from O
deaths O
caused O
by O
lack O
of O
medication O
rather O
than O
dangerous O
diseases O
. O

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
companies O
in O
developed O
countries O
ought O
to O
reduce O
their O
price O
of O
medicines O
to O
avoid O
such O
unnecessary O
deaths O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
more B-premise
lives I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
saved I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
effective I-premise
medicines I-premise
. O

The B-premise
medical I-premise
industry I-premise
in I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
is I-premise
incapable I-premise
of I-premise
producing I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
quality I-premise
drugs I-premise
. O

With B-premise
advanced I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
developed I-premise
world I-premise
has I-premise
achieved I-premise
remarkable I-premise
breakthroughs I-premise
in I-premise
making I-premise
medicines I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
cure I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
serious I-premise
illnesses I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
poorer I-premise
countries I-premise
gain I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
these I-premise
drugs I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
health I-premise
situations I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
better I-premise
. O

The B-claim
reduction I-claim
in I-claim
cost I-claim
of I-claim
medicines I-claim
therefore I-claim
shows I-claim
the I-claim
sign I-claim
of I-claim
humanity I-claim
. O

However O
, O
the B-claim
current I-claim
cost I-claim
of I-claim
medicines I-claim
is I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
fact I-claim
, I-claim
reasonable I-claim
and I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
medicines I-claim
' I-claim
effectiveness I-claim
. O

Apparently O
, O
the B-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
researching I-premise
, I-premise
testing I-premise
and I-premise
producing I-premise
drugs I-premise
in I-premise
masses I-premise
costs I-premise
a I-premise
substantial I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
these B-premise
products I-premise
prove I-premise
to I-premise
ensure I-premise
human I-premise
health I-premise
completely I-premise
. O

Suppose B-premise
companies I-premise
were I-premise
forced I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
cost I-premise
of I-premise
drugs I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
make I-premise
no I-premise
profit I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
running I-premise
up I-premise
debt I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
production I-premise
expenditure I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
measure I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
adopted I-claim
, I-claim
otherwise I-claim
those I-claim
companies I-claim
will I-claim
go I-claim
into I-claim
liquidation I-claim
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
long O
- O
term O
solution O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
other I-claim
measures I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
situation I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
advisable I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
to I-premise
encourage I-premise
medical I-premise
production I-premise
by I-premise
supplying I-premise
land I-premise
for I-premise
building I-premise
factories I-premise
and I-premise
reducing I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
taxes I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
charitable B-premise
organizations I-premise
can I-premise
buy I-premise
medicines I-premise
from I-premise
developed I-premise
countries I-premise
and I-premise
distribute I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
undeveloped I-premise
world I-premise
for I-premise
free I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
reducing I-claim
the I-claim
cost I-claim
of I-claim
medicines I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
may I-claim
exacerbate I-claim
their I-claim
qualities I-claim
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
government O
and O
medical O
foundations O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
distribution O
of O
drugs O
to O
the O
undeveloped O
world O
at O
a O
more O
reasonable O
price O
. O

Prohibit O
public O
smoking O
? O

The O
awareness O
on O
harmful O
effects O
from O
smoking O
among O
the O
general O
public O
has O
put O
much O
pressure O
on O
the O
government O
and O
private O
sectors O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some O
businesses O
prohibit O
smoking O
in O
their O
premises O
and O
even O
some O
governments O
restrict O
smoking O
in O
public O
area O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
the B-claim
move I-claim
will I-claim
do I-claim
more I-claim
good I-claim
by I-claim
looking I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim

. O

Firstly O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
well I-premise
known I-premise

clinically I-premise
proven I-premise
that I-premise
smoking I-premise
is I-premise
extremely I-premise

over I-premise

Recent B-premise
death I-premise
statistic I-premise
released I-premise

lethal I-premise
diseases I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
fatality I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
significantly I-claim
reduced I-claim
if I-claim
a I-claim
total I-claim
ban I-claim
on I-claim
public I-claim
smoking I-claim
is I-claim
implemented I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
image I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
nation I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
promoted I-claim
when I-claim
government I-claim
restricts I-claim
public I-claim
smoking I-claim
by I-claim
imposing I-claim
stern I-claim
penalty I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
offender I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
Brunei I-premise
government I-premise
had I-premise
recently I-premise
enforced I-premise
a I-premise
law I-premise
against I-premise
smoking I-premise
in I-premise
public I-premise
areas I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
cafés I-premise
, I-premise
hospital I-premise
and I-premise
shopping I-premise
street I-premise
. O

This B-premise
step I-premise
has I-premise
curbed I-premise
down I-premise
the I-premise
numbers I-premise
of I-premise
smokers I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
and I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
result I-premise
, I-premise
Brunei I-premise
remains I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
known I-premise
for I-premise
its I-premise
tranquility I-premise
and I-premise
cleanliness I-premise
. O

This B-premise
example I-premise
shows I-premise
the I-premise
benefit I-premise
of I-premise
restricting I-premise
public I-premise
smoking I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
whole I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
the B-claim
effort I-claim
to I-claim
prohibit I-claim
people I-claim
from I-claim
smoking I-claim
in I-claim
public I-claim
area I-claim
is I-claim
certainly I-claim
helping I-claim
in I-claim
curtailing I-claim
the I-claim
associated I-claim
health I-claim
risks I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
nation I-claim
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
more O
businesses O
and O
governments O
will O
follow O
the O
same O
initiatives O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
people O
and O
the O
country O
. O

Human O
activities O
are O
harming O
the O
Earth O
" O
Save O
the O
planet O
Earth O
" O
is O
a O
common O
line O
which O
can O
be O
read O
and O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
initiatives O
to O
protect O
the O
planet O
Earth O
from O
unbridled O
human O
developments O
. O

Although O
some O
people O
argue O
these O
developments O
are O
making O
our O
life O
comfortable O
, O
but O
concerns B-claim
to I-claim
save I-claim
Earth I-claim
are I-claim
vital I-claim
due O
to O
various O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
rapid B-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
infrastructure I-claim
is I-claim
eating I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
forest I-claim
throughout I-claim
world I-claim
. O

The B-premise
so I-premise
- I-premise
called I-premise
Concrete I-premise
jungles I-premise
have I-premise
evolved I-premise
endangering I-premise
forests I-premise
and I-premise
wild I-premise
life I-premise
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
life B-premise
saving I-premise
oxygen I-premise
is I-premise
produced I-premise
by I-premise
trees I-premise
after I-premise
converting I-premise
harmful I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxide I-premise
gas I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
wild B-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
essential I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
ecological I-premise
balance I-premise
on I-premise
planet I-premise
Earth I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
large B-claim
emissions I-claim
of I-claim
carbon I-claim
monoxide I-claim
gas I-claim
from I-claim
refrigerants I-claim
like I-claim
air I-claim
conditioners I-claim
have I-claim
depleted I-claim
ozone I-claim
layer I-claim
. O

Importance B-premise
of I-premise
ozone I-premise
layer I-premise
is I-premise
evident I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
fact I-premise
as I-premise
it I-premise
protects I-premise
us I-premise
from I-premise
harmful I-premise
ultra I-premise
violet I-premise
rays I-premise
. O

To O
add O
to O
it O
, O
excess B-premise
emission I-premise
of I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxide I-premise
gas I-premise
mainly I-premise
by I-premise
vehicles I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
has I-premise
increased I-premise
the I-premise
average I-premise
temperature I-premise
at I-premise
north I-premise
pole I-premise
which I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
has I-premise
increased I-premise
water I-premise
level I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
gradual I-premise
melting I-premise
of I-premise
glaciers I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
either B-claim
industrial I-claim
waste I-claim
or I-claim
domestic I-claim
waste I-claim
produced I-claim
everyday I-claim
is I-claim
badly I-claim
polluting I-claim
the I-claim
planet I-claim
Earth I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
a B-premise
large I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
unnoticed I-premise
industrial I-premise
waste I-premise
released I-premise
in I-premise
oceans I-premise
effects I-premise
aquatic I-premise
life I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
extent I-premise
. O

Harmful B-premise
chemicals I-premise
present I-premise
in I-premise
industrial I-premise
waste I-premise
kills I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
sea I-premise
creatures I-premise
in I-premise
oceans I-premise
or I-premise
rivers I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
Earth B-claim
is I-claim
our I-claim
home I-claim

and I-claim
it I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
protected I-claim
. O

Any O
human O
activity O
causing O
harm O
to O
Earth O
should O
be O
controlled O
and O
alternate O
ways O
should O
be O
devised O
to O
control O
damage O
. O

Creative O
ideas O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
leave O
minimum O
environmental O
footprints O
without O
compromising O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

Amount O
of O
control O
on O
media O
information O

Nowadays O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
controversial O
issues O
related O
to O
mass O
media O
is O
the O
correct O
amount O
of O
control O
posed O
on O
newspapers O
, O
televisions O
and O
websites O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
the O
government O
should O
exercise O
less O
restriction O
on O
sharing O
of O
media O
information O
to O
public O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
should I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
control I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
against I-claim
inappropriate I-claim
contents I-claim
and I-claim
unsuitable I-claim
foreign I-claim
cultures I-claim
. O

One B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
strong I-claim
arguments I-claim
in I-claim
favour I-claim
of I-claim
tighter I-claim
media I-claim
control I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
limit I-claim
the I-claim
violent I-claim
and I-claim
sexual I-claim
content I-claim
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
serious I-premise
impact I-premise
on I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
puberty I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
an B-premise
internet I-premise
cartoon I-premise
comedy I-premise
called I-premise
happy I-premise
tree I-premise
is I-premise
extremely I-premise
brutal I-premise
, I-premise
where I-premise
the I-premise
characters I-premise
usually I-premise
have I-premise
their I-premise
heads I-premise
or I-premise
limbs I-premise
tear I-premise
off I-premise
. O

Another O
supporting O
reason O
is O
that O
television B-claim
companies I-claim
import I-claim
foreign I-claim
programmes I-claim
from I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
audiences I-claim
might I-claim
accept I-claim
their I-claim
ideas I-claim
which I-claim
maybe I-claim
otherwise I-claim
not I-claim
welcomed I-claim
to I-claim
local I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

A B-premise
few I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
there I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
Japanese I-premise
game I-premise
show I-premise
which I-premise
involved I-premise
throwing I-premise
cream I-premise
cakes I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
loser I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
actually I-premise
very I-premise
environmentally I-premise
unfriendly I-premise
. O

The O
major O
opposing O
argument O
is O
to O
protect O
the O
safety O
of O
citizens O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
disclose I-claim
the I-claim
information I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
media I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
timely I-claim
manner I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
for I-claim
disasters I-claim
and I-claim
outbreak I-claim
of I-claim
new I-claim
diseases I-claim
. O

Taking B-premise
the I-premise
SARS I-premise
in I-premise
2003 I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
Chinese I-premise
government I-premise
limited I-premise
the I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
for I-premise
public I-premise
access I-premise
which I-premise
therefore I-premise
causes I-premise
numerous I-premise
deaths I-premise
. O

Even O
so O
, O
another B-premise
perspective I-premise
on I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
the I-premise
citizen I-premise
from I-premise
unnecessary I-premise
fear I-premise
and I-premise
unrest I-premise
. O

Both O
sides O
of O
the O
arguments O
have O
its O
merits O
. O

My O
personal O
view O
is O
that O
despite O
the O
emphasis O
of O
citizen O
safety O
, O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
regulate I-claim
the I-claim
correct I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
violent I-claim
and I-claim
sexual I-claim
content I-claim
and I-claim
censor I-claim
the I-claim
culturally I-claim
unsuitable I-claim
information I-claim
. O

Setting O
up O
a O
council O
to O
monitor O
the O
media O
information O
to O
the O
public O
could O
be O
a O
practical O
idea O
. O

Citizen O
's O
only O
responsibility O
is O
to O
pay O
taxes O

There O
is O
a O
controversial O
debate O
around O
the O
world O
about O
the O
duties O
of O
citizen O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
paying O
tax O
is O
the O
only O
responsibility O
of O
citizens O
, O
while O
others O
disagree O
and O
think O
that O
being O
a O
person O
in O
society O
involves O
more O
responsibilities O
. O

Taxes B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
income I-premise
for I-premise
every I-premise
country I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
extremely I-premise
important I-premise
for I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
paying I-premise
taxes I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
means I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
taking I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
economy I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
fulfilled I-claim
their I-claim
duty I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
citizen I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
individuals B-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
country I-claim
are I-claim
responsible I-claim
for I-claim
many I-claim
other I-claim
things I-claim
apart I-claim
from I-claim
paying I-claim
tax I-claim
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
citizens I-premise
must I-premise
obey I-premise
laws I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
were I-premise
imposed I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the B-premise
crime I-premise
rate I-premise
is I-premise
reduced I-premise
and I-premise
society I-premise
becomes I-premise
a I-premise
peaceful I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
will I-premise
develop I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
rapid I-premise
pace I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
being B-premise
a I-premise
citizen I-premise
in I-premise
society I-premise
should I-premise
protect I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
history I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people B-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
history I-premise
by I-premise
studying I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
with I-premise
full I-premise
concentration I-premise
or I-premise
reading I-premise
them I-premise
from I-premise
books I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a B-premise
person I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
unite I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
community I-premise
so I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
nation I-premise
. O

Indeed O
, O
if B-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
society I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
strong I-premise
bond I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
society I-premise
will I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
peaceful I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
helping I-premise
and I-premise
sharing I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

Taking O
everything O
into O
account O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
being B-claim
a I-claim
citizen I-claim
involves I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
duties I-claim
, I-claim
other I-claim
than I-claim
paying I-claim
taxes I-claim
. O

People B-claim
in I-claim
society I-claim
must I-claim
do I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
paying I-claim
taxes I-claim
to I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Testing O
on O
animals O
and O
keeping O
them O
in O
unnatural O
conditions O
Perhaps O
the O
most O
serious O
problem O
facing O
the O
animals O
' O
rights O
today O
is O
animal O
experimentation O
. O

Many O
medical O
treatments O
have O
been O
discovered O
by O
animal O
testing O
, O
including O
cancer O
and O
HIV O
drugs O
While O
most O
scientists O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
vital O
for O
improving O
human O
health O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
primates B-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
rights I-claim
as I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
. O

There B-claim
are I-claim
several I-claim
reasons I-claim
why I-claim
animal I-claim
testing I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
banned I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-premise
costs I-premise
outweigh I-premise
the I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
year I-premise
, I-premise
cosmetic I-premise
companies I-premise
, I-premise
farms I-premise
or I-premise
medical I-premise
schools I-premise
kill I-premise
millions I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
to I-premise
test I-premise
their I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
beneficial I-premise
result I-premise
. O

Animal B-premise
testing I-premise
costs I-premise
an I-premise
enormous I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
, O
since O
they B-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
fed I-premise
, I-premise
cared I-premise
for I-premise
and I-premise
treated I-premise
with I-premise
drugs I-premise
or I-premise
experimental I-premise
substances I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
animals B-premise
are I-premise
kept I-premise
in I-premise
unnatural I-premise
conditions I-premise
. O

Recent B-premise
studies I-premise
point I-premise
out I-premise
that I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
neglected I-premise
and I-premise
treated I-premise
poorly I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
influences I-premise
their I-premise
reactions I-premise
to I-premise
drugs I-premise
. O

In B-premise
March I-premise
2003 I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
lab I-premise
technician I-premise
shot I-premise
a I-premise
video I-premise
inside I-premise
a I-premise
lab I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
revealed I-premise
primates I-premise
in I-premise
cages I-premise
without I-premise
pain I-premise
medication I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
one I-premise
baboon I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
metal I-premise
cylinder I-premise
screwed I-premise
into I-premise
its I-premise
head I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
I O
think O
that O
sacrificing B-claim
animals I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
expensive I-claim
and I-claim
painful I-claim
activity I-claim
. O

There O
is O
also O
the O
argument O
that O
many O
ethical O
and O
genetic O
principles O
are O
broken O
when O
testing O
on O
animals O
. O

Many O
people O
agree O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
inhumane I-premise
and I-premise
cruel I-premise
to I-premise
cause I-premise
pain I-premise
to I-premise
animals I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
misleading I-premise
, O
since O
animals B-premise
and I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
response I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
drug I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
different I-premise
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
human B-claim
beings I-claim
have I-claim
no I-claim
moral I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
animals I-claim
in I-claim
ways I-claim
that I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
benefit I-claim
the I-claim
individual I-claim
. O

For O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O
it B-claim
seems I-claim
to I-claim
me I-claim
that I-claim
testing I-claim
on I-claim
animals I-claim
has I-claim
no I-claim
clear I-claim
result I-claim
and O
consequently O
, O
it B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
made I-claim
illegal I-claim
. O

In O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
exams B-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
role I-claim
to I-claim
play I-claim
in I-claim
ensuring I-claim
proper I-claim
and I-claim
objective I-claim
assessment I-claim
of I-claim

However O
, O
exams B-claim
need I-claim

carefully I-claim
designed I-claim

supplemented I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim

if I-claim
they I-claim

a I-claim
truly I-claim
useful I-claim

Richer O

in O

Improvements O
in O
health O
, O
education O
and O

are O
essential O
for O
the O
development O
of O
poorer O
nations O
. O

Poorer B-claim
nations I-claim
need I-claim
help I-claim
from I-claim
richer I-claim
nations I-claim
in I-claim
these I-claim
areas I-claim
to I-claim
develop I-claim
their I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
in B-premise
the I-premise
area I-premise
of I-premise
health I-premise
, I-premise
poorer I-premise
nations I-premise
normally I-premise
have I-premise
less I-premise
quantity I-premise
of I-premise
doctors I-premise
and I-premise
nurses I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
richer I-premise
nations I-premise
. O

High B-premise
population I-premise
in I-premise
poorer I-premise
countries I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
family I-premise
planning I-premise
caused I-premise
the I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
doctors I-premise
unbalance I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
quantity I-premise
of I-premise
resident I-premise
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
poorer B-premise
nations I-premise
are I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
hospitals I-premise
to I-premise
fulfill I-premise
the I-premise
demand I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
patients I-premise
. O

To O
solve O
these O
issues O
, O
richer B-claim
nations I-claim
can I-claim
contribute I-claim
by I-claim
delegating I-claim
doctors I-claim
and I-claim
nurses I-claim
to I-claim
these I-claim
power I-claim
nations I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
donate I-claim
money I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
hospitals I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
in B-premise
the I-premise
area I-premise
of I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
generally I-premise
agreed I-premise
that I-premise
poorer I-premise
countries I-premise
often I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
in I-premise
schools I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
lecturers I-premise
in I-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
institutions I-premise
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
education B-premise
for I-premise
these I-premise
countries I-premise
normally I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
free I-premise
so I-premise
only I-premise
certain I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
afford I-premise
it I-premise
. O

In O
order O
to O
solve O
the O
education O
manpower O
problem O
, O
richer B-claim
countries I-claim
can I-claim
allocate I-claim
experienced I-claim
educators I-claim
to I-claim
train I-claim
more I-claim
teachers I-claim
and I-claim
lecturers I-claim
in I-claim
poorer I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
for B-claim
the I-claim
issue I-claim
of I-claim
education I-claim
fee I-claim
, I-claim
richer I-claim
countries I-claim
should I-claim
offer I-claim
scholarships I-claim
and I-claim
loan I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
qualified I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Lastly O
, O
in B-claim
the I-claim
area I-claim
of I-claim
trade I-claim
, I-claim
no I-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
deny I-claim
that I-claim
poorer I-claim
countries I-claim
are I-claim
lagging I-claim
behind I-claim
richer I-claim
countries I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
shortage I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
. O

Trading B-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
active I-premise
in I-premise
poorer I-premise
countries I-premise
may I-premise
also I-premise
be I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
incomplete I-premise
transportation I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
residents B-premise
in I-premise
rural I-premise
areas I-premise
still I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
farm I-premise
for I-premise
food I-premise
production I-premise
. O

As O
a O
token O
of O
goodwill O
, O
richer B-premise
nations I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
financial I-premise
service I-premise
to I-premise
poorer I-premise
countries I-premise
to I-premise
encourage I-premise
trading I-premise
. O

The B-premise
former I-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
give I-premise
consultation I-premise
on I-premise
setting I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
complete I-premise
and I-premise
efficient I-premise
transportation I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
trading I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
richer B-claim
nations I-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
more I-claim
responsibility I-claim
for I-claim
helping I-claim
the I-claim
poorer I-claim
nations I-claim
in I-claim
all I-claim
health I-claim
, I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
trade I-claim
. O

Improvements B-claim
in I-claim
these I-claim
areas I-claim
will I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
life I-claim
for I-claim
residents I-claim
in I-claim
poorer I-claim
nations I-claim
which I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
use I-claim
to I-claim
grow I-claim
their I-claim
homeland I-claim
. O

There O
will O
be O
soon O
no O

for O

In O
recent O
years O
it O
has O
become O
more O
common O
for O
teachers O
to O
use O
technological O
tools O
in O
the O
learning O
process O
. O

However O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
agree I-claim
that I-claim
this I-claim
explosion I-claim
in I-claim
technology I-claim
will I-claim
' I-claim
innovate I-claim
' I-claim
the I-claim
education I-claim
system I-claim
, I-claim
by I-claim
replacing I-claim
teachers I-claim
with I-claim
computers I-claim
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
teachers O
will O
never O
be O
replaced O
by O
computers O
. O

Firstly O
, O
computers B-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
operated I-claim
by I-claim
people I-claim
. O

No B-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
argue I-premise
that I-premise
technological I-premise
tools I-premise
are I-premise
must I-premise
- I-premise
haves I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
classroom I-premise
of I-premise
today I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
lessons B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
attractive I-premise
and I-premise
easier I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
put I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
Power I-premise
Point I-premise
presentation I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
presented I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
LCD I-premise
Projector I-premise
. O

However O
, O
scientists B-premise
prove I-premise
that I-premise
every I-premise
classroom I-premise
needs I-premise
trained I-premise
staff I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
these I-premise
interactive I-premise
and I-premise
innovative I-premise
ways I-premise
of I-premise
teaching I-premise
. O

I O
agree O
that O
nowadays O
the O
learning O
process O
benefits O
greatly O
from O
computers O
, O
but O
they B-premise
are I-premise
just I-premise
tools I-premise
for I-premise
teachers I-premise

and I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
work I-premise
properly I-premise
without I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
touch I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
children B-claim
need I-claim
human I-claim
interactions I-claim
. O

No B-premise
matter I-premise
how I-premise
advanced I-premise
technology I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
clear I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
computer I-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
its I-premise
pupils I-premise
. O

As B-premise
a I-premise
recent I-premise
interview I-premise
with I-premise
Josh I-premise

human I-premise

' I-premise
This I-premise
verbal I-premise
and I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
verbal I-premise
communication I-premise
between I-premise
teachers I-premise
and I-premise
children I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
step I-premise
towards I-premise
a I-premise
proper I-premise
education O
. O

Without B-premise
someone I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
explain I-premise
and I-premise
understand I-premise
their I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
pupils I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
actually I-premise
learn I-premise
' I-premise
. O

I O
am O
inclined O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
scientific O
view O
, O
because O
only B-premise
a I-premise
teacher I-premise
can I-premise
feel I-premise
and I-premise
connect I-premise
with I-premise
pupils I-premise
, I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
model I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
no I-claim
school I-claim
without I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

I O
think O
that O
computers B-claim
will I-claim
continue I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
used I-claim
by I-claim
teachers I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
learning I-claim
process I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
never I-claim
take I-claim
their I-claim
place I-claim
. O

Teachers B-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
just I-claim
teachers I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
conseilieurs I-claim

Advanced O

and O
machine O
for O
farmers O
, O
good O
or O
bad O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
discussion O
about O
the O
agriculture O
development O
has O
become O
a O
controversy O
. O

While O
some O
appear O
to O
believe O
that O
advanced O
plant O
foods O
incorporate O
with O
newly O
developed O
devices O
significantly O
reduce O
the O
cost O
of O
producing O
farm O
products O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
this O
collaboration O
exerts O
a O
series O
of O
negative O
effects O
to O
people O
's O
health O
condition O
and O
the O
society O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
applying B-premise
the I-premise
advanced I-premise
fertilizers I-premise
in I-premise
combine I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
automatic I-premise
reaping I-premise
resources I-premise
increase I-premise
farmers I-premise
' I-premise
economic I-premise
profit I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
artificial B-premise
fertilizers I-premise
catalyze I-premise
the I-premise
capacity I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
inch I-premise
of I-premise
farmland I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
churn I-premise
out I-premise
the I-premise
crops I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
automatic I-premise
machinery I-premise
enhances I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
efficiency I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
harvest I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
the B-claim
production I-claim
and I-claim
labour I-claim
cost I-claim
of I-claim
each I-claim
kilogram I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
agriculture I-claim
products I-claim
dramatically I-claim
decreased I-claim
. O

However O
, O
high B-claim
- I-claim
tech I-claim
fertilizers I-claim
pose I-claim
a I-claim
potential I-claim
threat I-claim
to I-claim
individuals I-claim
' I-claim
health I-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim
being I-claim
. O

Unlike B-premise
the I-premise
organic I-premise
plant I-premise
foods I-premise
, I-premise
industrialized I-premise
fertilizers I-premise
are I-premise
made I-premise
of I-premise
unusual I-premise
chemicals I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
varying I-premise
the I-premise
gene I-premise
of I-premise
crops I-premise
into I-premise
those I-premise
unknown I-premise
substances I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
remaining I-premise
inside I-premise
of I-premise
plants I-premise
permanently I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
consumers B-premise
who I-premise
intake I-premise
those I-premise
fertilized I-premise
products I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
regular I-premise
base I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
suffer I-premise
a I-premise
series I-premise
of I-premise
disease I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
excessively B-claim
relying I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
electronic I-claim
equipment I-claim
for I-claim
harvest I-claim
causes I-claim
several I-claim
impacts I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

One B-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
worsens I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
by I-premise
releasing I-premise
the I-premise
excessive I-premise

emission I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
manual B-premise
harvest I-premise
prevents I-premise
severe I-premise
environmental I-premise
damages I-premise
. O

For O
another O
, O
mechanical B-premise
reaper I-premise
causes I-premise
the I-premise
rise I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
unemployment I-premise
rate I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
farming I-premise
industry I-premise
, O
possibly O
because O
high B-premise
- I-premise
end I-premise
reaping I-premise
plants I-premise
replace I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
workers I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
fields I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
even O
though O
newly B-claim
developed I-claim
plant I-claim
foods I-claim
and I-claim
machinery I-claim
make I-claim
significant I-claim
financial I-claim
success I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
farmers I-claim
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
the B-claim
demerits I-claim
of I-claim
applying I-claim
these I-claim
new I-claim
developments I-claim
in I-claim

Funding O
artists O

Nowadays O
, O
in O
order O
to O
save O
as O
much O
budget O
as O
possible O
and O
improve O
the O
economy O
of O
the O
country O
, O
every O
government O
around O
the O
world O
is O
seeking O
for O
some O
ways O
to O
spend O
wisely O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
suggestion O
that O
governments O
should O
not O
continue O
to O
fund O
the O
artists O
, O
but O
they O
ought O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
other O
necessary O
subjects O
such O
as O
medical O
research O
and O
space O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
firmly O
disagree O
with O
this O
recommendation O
due O
to O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
believe O
artists O
should O
be O
funded O
is O
because O
art B-premise
helps I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
lives I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
attracting I-premise
tourists I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
monuments B-premise
that I-premise
represent I-premise
each I-premise
city I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
illustrate I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
's I-premise
history I-premise
and I-premise
culture I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
more I-premise
beautiful I-premise
and I-premise
an I-premise
attractive I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
tourists I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some B-premise
countries I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
tourism I-premise
as I-premise
their I-premise
main I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
revenue I-premise
, O
thus O
, O
the B-claim
governments I-claim
should I-claim
help I-claim
arts I-claim
because O
their B-premise
work I-premise
crafts I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
necessary I-premise
to I-premise
boost I-premise
the I-premise
tourist I-premise
industry I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
sculptures B-premise
and I-premise
paintings I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
museums I-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
galleries I-premise
generally I-premise
reflect I-premise
the I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
civilization I-premise
of I-premise
every I-premise
generation I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
culture B-claim
and I-claim
history I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
country I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
reserved I-claim
and I-claim
assured I-claim
by I-claim
art I-claim
. O

Young B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
history I-premise
and I-premise
culture I-premise
by I-premise
observing I-premise
various I-premise
work I-premise
crafts I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
why O
artists O
should O
be O
helped O
is O
because O
talent B-claim
in I-claim
art I-claim
is I-claim
extremely I-claim
precious I-claim
and I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
wasted I-claim
. O

Indeed O
, O
not B-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
blessed I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
talent I-premise
of I-premise
paintings I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
crafts I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
this B-premise
type I-premise
of I-premise
talent I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
valued I-premise
as I-premise
other I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
talents I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
talent I-premise
in I-premise
science I-premise
or I-premise
literature I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
art B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
valuable I-claim
object I-claim
for I-claim
every I-claim
country I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
talent I-claim
in I-claim
this I-claim
area I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
discovered I-claim
everywhere I-claim
, O
so O
I O
think O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
help I-claim
and I-claim
encourage I-claim
artists I-claim
to I-claim
continue I-claim
their I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Whether O
athletes O
and O
singers O
are O
overpaid O
? O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
are O
paid O
reasonable O
salaries O
, O
which O
can O
be O
up O
to O
millions O
of O
dollars O
each O
year O
. O

However O
, O
that O
is O
not O
equal O
to O
their O
actual O
contributions O
to O
the O
society O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
their B-claim
salary I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
lower I-claim
level I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
appropriate I-claim
compared I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
peoples I-claim
in I-claim
scientific I-claim
or I-claim
social I-claim
, I-claim
economic I-claim
fields I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
some O
people O
claim O
that O
athletes B-claim
and I-claim
singers I-claim
deserve I-claim
their I-claim
current I-claim
salary I-claim
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
exceptional I-premise
ability I-premise
that I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
own I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
hardly B-premise
anyone I-premise
could I-premise
play I-premise
basketball I-premise
as I-premise
skillfully I-premise
as I-premise
Michael I-premise
Jordan I-premise
- I-premise
a I-premise
legendary I-premise
former I-premise
American I-premise
player I-premise
who I-premise
won I-premise
several I-premise
times I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
NBA I-premise
championship I-premise
. O

They B-premise
also I-premise
point I-premise
out I-premise
that I-premise
these I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
undergo I-premise
painstaking I-premise
and I-premise
industrious I-premise
training I-premise
, I-premise
let I-premise
alone I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
contests I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
recognized I-premise
and I-premise
prove I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
singers I-premise
and I-premise
athletes I-premise
, I-premise
few I-premise
of I-premise
whom I-premise
could I-premise
rise I-premise
to I-premise
fame I-premise
and I-premise
victory I-premise
ultimately I-premise
. O

Overcoming B-premise
all I-premise
these I-premise
obstacles I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
paid I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
deal I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
extraordinary I-premise
efforts I-premise
. O

However O
, O
their O
talents O
should O
not O
be O
overrated O
. O

Other O
people O
say O
that O
singers B-premise
and I-premise
athletes I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
fact I-premise
, I-premise
contribute I-premise
insignificantly I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
assumed I-premise
the I-premise
amazing I-premise
performances I-premise
they I-premise
give I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
audiences I-premise
are I-premise
only I-premise
valuable I-premise
in I-premise
aesthetic I-premise
and I-premise
entertaining I-premise
terms I-premise
. O

While B-premise
scientists I-premise
invent I-premise
machines I-premise
serving I-premise
daily I-premise
lives I-premise
, I-premise
doctors I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
and I-premise
cure I-premise
their I-premise
diseases I-premise
and I-premise
policemen I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
ensure I-premise
the I-premise
safety I-premise
and I-premise
stability I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
nation I-premise
, I-premise
singers I-premise
and I-premise
athletes I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
play I-premise
a I-premise
helpful I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
improving I-premise
the I-premise
material I-premise
life I-premise
. O

They B-premise
commit I-premise
themselves I-premise
to I-premise
promoting I-premise
relaxation I-premise
and I-premise
enjoyment I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
audience I-premise
. O

Indeed O
, O
their B-premise
contribution I-premise
is I-premise
less I-premise
important I-premise
than I-premise
those I-premise
from I-premise
doctors I-premise
or I-premise
scientists I-premise
, I-premise
albeit I-premise
necessary I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
their B-claim
privilege I-claim
of I-claim
salary I-claim
seems I-claim
groundless I-claim
, I-claim
while I-claim
the I-claim
main I-claim
work I-claim
forces I-claim
receive I-claim
modest I-claim
salaries I-claim
which I-claim
only I-claim
enable I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
afford I-claim
bare I-claim
necessities I-claim
. O

From O
all O
analysis O
suggested O
above O
, O
professional B-claim
athletes I-claim
and I-claim
singers I-claim
are I-claim
overpaid I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
contributions I-claim
. O

I O
think O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
modification O
in O
the O
salary O
of O
professional O
singers O
and O
athletes O
to O
balance O
with O
those O
of O
people O
in O
other O
fields O
, O
namely O
science O
and O
society O
, O
who O
are O
the O
driving O
forces O
for O
the O
prosperity O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

Capital O
punishment O
is O
necessary O
or O
not O
? O

Capital O
punishment O
is O
a O
controversial O
debate O
in O
many O
countries O
. O

In O
a O
world O
where O
brutal O
crimes O
need O
to O
be O
deterred O
, O
it O
may O
be O
true O
that O
the O
death O
penalty O
is O
an O
efficient O
retribution O
to O
admonish O
the O
violence O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
society O
grows O
, O
human O
rights O
become O
more O
highly O
respected O
, O
" B-claim
murdering I-claim
" I-claim
criminals I-claim
is I-claim
therefore I-claim
immoral I-claim
and I-claim
hard I-claim
to I-claim
accept I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
recognized O
that O
every B-claim
human I-claim
being I-claim
has I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
and I-claim
no I-claim
authority I-claim
is I-claim
empowered I-claim
to I-claim
deprive I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Although O
what B-premise
criminals I-premise
cause I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
specifically I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
victims I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
indeed I-premise
significantly I-premise
offensive I-premise
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
humans I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
lives I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
valued I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
execution B-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
resolve I-premise
the I-premise
consequences I-premise
of I-premise
crime I-premise
, O
not O
to O
mention O
it B-premise
could I-premise
put I-premise
the I-premise
criminal I-premise
's I-premise
family I-premise
through I-premise
hardship I-premise
while I-premise
the I-premise
pain I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
victim I-premise
's I-premise
kin I-premise
is I-premise
never I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
consoled I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
capital B-claim
punishment I-claim
is I-claim
certainly I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
only I-claim
option I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
crimes I-claim
, I-claim
life I-claim
imprisonment I-claim
is I-claim
just I-claim
as I-claim
effective I-claim
by I-claim
detaining I-claim
the I-claim
criminals I-claim
in I-claim
prison I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
rest I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
in B-premise
terms I-premise
of I-premise
punishment I-premise
, I-premise
living I-premise
a I-premise
miserable I-premise
life I-premise
with I-premise
restriction I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
outside I-premise
and I-premise
sustaining I-premise
the I-premise
feeling I-premise
of I-premise
guilt I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dark I-premise
bounded I-premise
room I-premise
are I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
obsessing I-premise
than I-premise
being I-premise
killed I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
. O

The B-claim
third I-claim
reason I-claim
why I-claim
the I-claim
death I-claim
penalty I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
banned I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
chance I-claim
that I-claim
innocent I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
wrongly I-claim
convicted I-claim
. O

Juries B-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
humans I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
discretion I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
many B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
executed I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
crime I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
commit I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
question I-premise
of I-premise
fairness I-premise
in I-premise
judicial I-premise
system I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
capital B-claim
punishment I-claim
presents I-claim
an I-claim
extreme I-claim
warning I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
community I-claim
, O
I O
firmly O
object O
to O
it O
because O
it B-claim
is I-claim
absurd I-claim
and I-claim
inhumane I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
replaced I-claim
by I-claim
a I-claim
life I-claim
sentence I-claim
. O

Businesses O
should O
be O
only O
concerned O
about O
making O
profits O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
companies O
, O
factories O
and O
businesses O
establish O
to O
provide O
products O
which O
are O
people O
's O
need O
and O
make O
a O
profit O
for O
their O
managers O
. O

However O
, O
I B-claim
completely I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
idea I-claim
that I-claim
businesses I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
anything I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
profit I-claim
. O

With B-claim
this I-claim
permission I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
hit I-claim
and I-claim
damage I-claim
everything I-claim
for I-claim
just I-claim
making I-claim
a I-claim
profit I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
if B-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
any I-claim
control I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
businesses I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
permitted I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
everything I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
threaten I-claim
the I-claim
beings I-claim
' I-claim
life I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
human I-claim
, I-claim
animals I-claim
and I-claim
plants I-claim
. O

As B-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
we I-premise
read I-premise
and I-premise
hear I-premise
in I-premise
televisions I-premise
and I-premise
newspapers I-premise
that I-premise
some I-premise
factories I-premise
hit I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
by I-premise
their I-premise
toxic I-premise
substances I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
if B-premise
we I-premise
let I-premise
them I-premise
do I-premise
anything I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
to I-premise
just I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
profit I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
produce I-premise
products I-premise
with I-premise
low I-premise
qualities I-premise
and I-premise
high I-premise
prices I-premise
, O
therefore O
they B-claim
might I-claim
hit I-claim
consumer I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
few I-premise
months I-premise
ago I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
broadcast I-premise
from I-premise
TV I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
company I-premise
which I-premise
produced I-premise
baby I-premise
milk I-premise
, I-premise
sold I-premise
milk I-premise
which I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
quality I-premise
and I-premise

it I-premise
caused I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
babies I-premise
die I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
all B-claim
companies I-claim
, I-claim
factories I-claim
and I-claim
businesses I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
monitored I-claim
by I-claim
governments I-claim
and I-claim
executive I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
let I-claim
do I-claim
anything I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
just I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
making I-claim
profit I-claim
. O

They B-claim
can I-claim
hit I-claim
both I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
and I-claim
human I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
easily I-claim
. O

New O
high O
school O

Although O
some O
of O
my O
neighbors O
will O
oppose O
this O
idea O
, O
personally O
I O
approve O
it O
. O

The B-claim
new I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
will I-claim
bring I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
advantages I-claim
to I-claim
my I-claim
community I-claim
. O

The B-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
of I-claim
my I-claim
district I-claim
is I-claim
pretty I-claim
old I-claim
and I-claim
lacks I-claim
in I-claim
necessities I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
, I-claim
so I-claim
they I-claim
ca I-claim
n't I-claim
get I-claim
enough I-claim
education I-claim
. O

I O
really O
believe O
that O
new B-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
addition I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
educational I-claim
system I-claim
of I-claim
my I-claim
community I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the B-claim
new I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
will I-claim
bring I-claim
a I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
opportunities I-claim
for I-claim
student I-claim
concerned I-claim
in I-claim
education I-claim
. O

Their B-premise
old I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
is I-premise
pretty I-premise
old I-premise
and I-premise
need I-premise
in I-premise
new I-premise
educational I-premise
materials I-premise
, I-premise
repairing I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
sport I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Also O
the B-premise
laboratory I-premise
of I-premise
physics I-premise
and I-premise
chemistry I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
bad I-premise
condition I-premise
, O
so O
the B-premise
students I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
study I-premise
well I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
study I-premise
with I-premise
new I-premise
breath I-premise
and I-premise
great I-premise
enthusiasm I-premise
in I-premise
new I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
new I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
place I-claim
for I-claim
new I-claim
connections I-claim
between I-claim
the I-claim
student I-claim
of I-claim
different I-claim
communities I-claim
and I-claim
districts I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
city I-claim
. O

After B-premise
classes I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
get I-premise
together I-premise
in I-premise
building I-premise
of I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
competitions I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
during B-premise
the I-premise
football I-premise
match I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
high I-premise
schools I-premise
will I-premise
come I-premise
and I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
competition I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
keep I-premise
in I-premise
touch I-premise
. O

This B-premise
will I-premise
increase I-premise
the I-premise
social I-premise
connections I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
. O

The B-premise
only I-premise
disadvantage I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
noisiness I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
competitions I-premise
. O

The B-premise
people I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
neighborhood I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
bit I-premise
perturbed I-premise
, O
but O
I O
think O
this B-premise
is I-premise
n't I-premise
a I-premise
important I-premise
reason I-premise
for I-premise
ceasing I-premise
the I-premise
competitions I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
this B-claim
new I-claim
construction I-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
advantages I-claim
like I-claim
new I-claim
connections I-claim
between I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
communities I-claim
, I-claim
also I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
educational I-claim
equipment I-claim
will I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
enthusiasm I-claim
toward I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

The B-claim
only I-claim
disadvantage I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
nosiness I-claim
of I-claim
competitions I-claim
which I-claim
students I-claim
will I-claim
participate I-claim
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
n't I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
deal I-premise
. O

So O
the B-claim
new I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
addition I-claim
for I-claim
my I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Parents O
or O
other O
adult O
relatives O
should O
make O
important O
decisions O
for O
their O
olde O

It O
might O
seem O
that O
teenaged O
children O
particularly O
in O
age O
of O
15 O
- O
18 O
are O
fully O
grown O
, O
so O
they O
do O
not O
need O
any O
help O
for O
making O
important O
decisions O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
teenagers B-claim
need I-claim
more I-claim
attention I-claim
and I-claim
help I-claim
in I-claim
comparison I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
higher I-claim
ages I-claim
. O

I O
will O
discuss O
my O
view O
in O
two O
main O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
parents B-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
adult I-premise
relatives I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
experienced I-premise
towards I-premise
children I-premise
, O
therefore O
they B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
advisor I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
experienced I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
numbers I-premise
of I-premise
stuffs I-premise
during I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
, O
so O
if B-premise
children I-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
advices I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
prevent I-premise
happening I-premise
worst I-premise
things I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
value I-premise
things I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
money I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
enjoy I-premise
they I-premise
life I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
parents B-claim
and I-claim
adults I-claim
relatives I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
consular I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
teenagers I-claim
, O
because O
unfortunately B-premise
nowadays I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
some I-premise
individuals I-premise
who I-premise
cheat I-premise
the I-premise
others I-premise
for I-premise
gaining I-premise
more I-premise
power I-premise
and I-premise
money I-premise
. O

They B-premise
cheat I-premise
young I-premise
ages I-premise
because O
they B-premise
believe I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
immature I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
trap I-premise
them I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
makes O
no O
difference O
, O
people O
from O
young O
ages O
to O
old O
ages O
are O
free O
to O
make O
a O
decision O
, O
nonetheless O
sometimes O
to O
prevent O
some O
problems O
coming O
up O
for O
young O
individuals O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
idea I-claim
to I-claim
ask I-claim
parents I-claim
and I-claim
adult I-claim
relatives I-claim
to I-claim
give I-claim
a I-claim
piece I-claim
of I-claim
advice I-claim
. O

Children O
are O
free O
You O
hardly O
ever O
can O
find O
a O
person O
who O
says O
that O
he O
or O
she O
had O
unpleasant O
childhood O
. O

When O
individuals O
reminisce O
their O
memories O
they O
absolutely O
infer O
to O
some O
of O
their O
childhood O
events O
. O

As O
much O
as O
their O
events O
might O
were O
bitter O
, O
in O
their O
adulthood O
they O
are O
sweet O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
childhood B-claim
is I-claim
definitely I-claim
the I-claim
happiest I-claim
time I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
two I-claim
main I-claim
areas I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
children B-premise
are I-premise
free I-premise
whatever I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
restricted I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
limitation I-premise
are I-premise
really I-premise
rare I-premise
. O

Because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
age I-premise
of I-premise
growth I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
allowed I-premise
whatever I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
to I-premise
experience I-premise
new I-premise
stuffs I-premise
. O

Therefore O
there B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
argument I-claim
and I-claim
punishment I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in B-claim
this I-claim
age I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
expected I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
responsible I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
educate I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
, O
so O
they B-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
hand I-claim
to I-claim
enjoy I-claim
this I-claim
stage I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I B-premise
made I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
friends I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
age I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
almost I-premise
traveled I-premise
to I-premise
all I-premise
cities I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
county I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
kindergarten I-premise
. O

Also O
I B-premise
got I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
different I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
and I-premise
plants I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
age I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
maintain O
that O
the B-claim
best I-claim
phase I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
life I-claim
is I-claim
their I-claim
childhood I-claim
. O

They B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
free I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
whatever I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
without I-claim
any I-claim
confine I-claim
or I-claim
punishment I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
free I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
hands I-claim
to I-claim
try I-claim
and I-claim
experience I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
and I-claim
enjoy I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Concentrate O
on O
the O
objectives O
- O
people O
attend O
schools O
for O
various O
reasons O

From O
many O
centuries O
ago O
, O
universities O
have O
been O
playing O
an O
important O
role O
in O
ones O
' O
life O
. O

Different O
people O
attend O
university O
for O
different O
point O
of O
views O
. O

In O
my O
perspective O
, O
the B-claim
three I-claim
most I-claim
reasons I-claim
are I-claim
increased I-claim
knowledge I-claim
, I-claim
career I-claim
preparation I-claim
and I-claim
new I-claim
experiences I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
for B-premise
most I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
university I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
ideal I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
understanding I-premise
. O

Truthfully O
, O
in B-premise
this I-premise
wonderful I-premise
academic I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
everyone I-premise
is I-premise
provided I-premise
with I-premise
varieties I-premise
and I-premise
gigantic I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
by I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
professors I-premise
and I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
trained I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
people B-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
strengthen I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
through B-premise
the I-premise
instructions I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
sufficient I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
laboratory I-premise
, I-premise
library I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
is I-premise
capable I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
research I-premise
on I-premise
every I-premise
academic I-premise
aspect I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
can I-claim
gain I-claim
a I-claim
deep I-claim
sight I-claim
into I-claim
what I-claim
are I-claim
they I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
studying O
in O
university O
means O
that O
you O
have O
totally O
turned O
into O
a O
different O
page O
of O
your O
life O
, O
which O
included O
many O
new O
experiences O
. O

The B-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
individual I-premise
who I-premise
enroll I-premise
in I-premise
university I-premise
are I-premise
enormous I-premise
, I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
school I-premise
one I-premise
person I-premise
have I-premise
studied I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
students B-claim
are I-claim
given I-claim
such I-claim
fantastic I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
new I-claim
and I-claim
wide I-claim
relationships I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
from I-claim
any I-claim
corner I-claim
of I-claim
one I-claim
nation I-claim
, I-claim
even I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
whole I-claim
world I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my B-premise
brother I-premise
are I-premise
studying I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
international I-premise
university I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
mixed I-premise
community I-premise
include I-premise
Vietnam I-premise
, I-premise
Brazil I-premise
, I-premise
Argentina I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

And B-premise
he I-premise
told I-premise
me I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
excited I-premise
for I-premise
experiencing I-premise
such I-premise
new I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
main I-premise
purposes I-premise
when I-premise
attending I-premise
university I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
preparing B-claim
for I-claim
career I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
essential I-claim
function I-claim
of I-claim
university I-claim
. O

Students B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
do I-premise
homework I-premise
, I-premise
assignment I-premise
and I-premise
attend I-premise
class I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
volunteer I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
internship I-premise
and I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
some I-premise
experiences I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
outside I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
discover I-premise
what I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
goals I-premise
are I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
they B-premise
know I-premise
where I-premise
and I-premise
what I-premise
to I-premise
put I-premise
high I-premise
emphasis I-premise
on I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
their I-premise
objectives I-premise
. O

In O
summation O
, O
people O
may O
attend O
university O
for O
various O
reasons O
. O

Some O
want O
to O
enjoy O
new O
experiences O
, O
some O
are O
going O
to O
prepare O
for O
their O
future O
career O
, O
while O
others O
are O
eager O
to O
develop O
their O
understanding O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
purposes O
could O
be O
various O
, O
everybody B-claim
who I-claim
is I-claim
studying I-claim
in I-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
concentrate I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
objectives I-claim
and I-claim
try I-claim
their I-claim
best I-claim
. O

People O
are O
put O
too O
much O
focus O
on O
making O
wealth O
and O
progress O
in O
technology O

The O
life O
today O
is O
totally O
different O
from O
half O
centuries O
before O
. O

Advances O
in O
technology O
do O
help O
humans O
to O
solve O
abundant O
of O
problems O
; O
however O
it O
also O
deprives O
of O
some O
things O
that O
we O
had O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
life B-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
old I-claim
days I-claim
brings I-claim
more I-claim
happiness I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
than I-claim
today I-claim
for I-claim
several I-claim
reasons I-claim
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
life B-premise
is I-premise
simple I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
all I-premise
humans I-premise
compete I-premise
together I-premise
. O

Since O
world B-premise
population I-premise
getting I-premise
higher I-premise
, O
competition B-premise
is I-premise
getting I-premise
fierce I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
handle I-premise
your I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
someone I-premise
will I-premise
replace I-premise
you I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
. O

People B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
put I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
effort I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
their I-premise
living I-premise
condition I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
lives B-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
old I-claim
days I-claim
is I-claim
easier I-claim
than I-claim
today I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
the B-premise
environment I-premise
today I-premise
is I-premise
serious I-premise
damaged I-premise
. O

Looking B-premise
out I-premise
the I-premise
windows I-premise
, I-premise
what I-premise
I I-premise
see I-premise
is I-premise
n't I-premise
sky I-premise
, I-premise
trees I-premise
or I-premise
mountains I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
is I-premise
coldly I-premise
high I-premise
buildings I-premise
. O

Everyday B-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
walk I-premise
on I-premise
hard I-premise
roads I-premise
, I-premise
breath I-premise
in I-premise
polluted I-premise
air I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
limited I-premise
space I-premise
. O

What O
's O
worse O
, O
it B-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
proved I-premise
that I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
condition I-premise
will I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
mental I-premise
diseases I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
environment I-claim
our I-claim
grandparents I-claim
live I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
comfortable I-claim
than I-claim
today I-claim
. O

The B-claim
third I-claim
reason I-claim
is I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
pace I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Today B-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
the I-premise
news I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
chat I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
through I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
by I-premise
planes I-premise
; O
however O
, O
it B-premise
also I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
any I-premise
thing I-premise
happens I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
will I-premise
affect I-premise
our I-premise
life I-premise
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
react I-premise
properly I-premise
and I-premise
immediately I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
vulnerable I-premise
situation I-premise
. O

We B-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
choice I-premise
but I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
fast I-premise
pace I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
while O
there O
some B-claim
people I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
pretty I-claim
good I-claim
condition I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
only I-claim
a I-claim
minority I-claim
. O

People B-claim
are I-claim
put I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
making I-claim
wealth I-claim
and I-claim
progress I-claim
in I-claim
technology I-claim
; O
nevertheless O
, O
behind O
the O
glamorous O
facade O
of O
it O
, O
what O
we O
loss O
will O
never O
be O
returned O
. O

Educated O
high O
- O
school O
students O
with O
bright O
and O
independent O
mind O
High O
school O
is O
the O
time O
when O
you O
decide O
your O
future O
career O
and O
particular O
field O
you O
want O
to O
concentrate O
and O
interested O
in O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
high B-claim
school I-claim
should I-claim
permit I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
courses I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
for I-claim
several I-claim
reasons I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
freedom I-claim
of I-claim
choice I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
progress I-claim
in I-claim
students I-claim
grades I-claim
and I-claim
knowledge I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
students I-claim
explore I-claim
their I-claim
aptitude I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
above O
students B-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
. O

Not B-premise
allowing I-premise
students I-premise
their I-premise
desired I-premise
subjects I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
chosen I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
restriction I-premise
of I-premise
human I-premise
rights I-premise
. O

As B-premise
children I-premise
of I-premise
independent I-premise
country I-premise
we I-premise
should I-premise
know I-premise
our I-premise
rights I-premise
and I-premise
opportunities I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
our I-premise
goals I-premise
and I-premise
dreams I-premise
. O

Next O
, O
students B-premise
should I-premise
choose I-premise
their I-premise
classes I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
progress I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
and I-premise
grades I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
avoid I-premise
conflicts I-premise
among I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
teachers I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
and I-premise
productive I-premise
for I-premise
both I-premise
instructor I-premise
and I-premise
students I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
taking I-premise
art I-premise
class I-premise
everyone I-premise
shared I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
interests I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

Giving B-claim
chance I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
their I-claim
interested I-claim
fields I-claim
of I-claim
study I-claim
is I-claim
merit I-claim
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
most O
important O
reason O
I O
support O
this O
idea O
is O
he B-premise
or I-premise

she I-premise
can I-premise
explore I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
area I-premise

she I-premise
/ I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
an I-premise
aptitude I-premise
. O

When B-premise
schools I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
such I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
opportunity I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
do I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
and I-premise
succeed I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
lives I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
point I-premise
most I-premise
people I-premise
get I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
this B-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
opportunities I-claim
can I-claim
raise I-claim
future I-claim
geniuses I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
as O
a O
young O
women O
I B-claim
want I-claim
my I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
knowledge I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
desire I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
distinguished I-claim
achievement I-claim
so O
it B-claim
has I-claim
advantage I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
for I-claim
him I-claim

but I-claim
for I-claim
society I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
. O

Having O
three O
reasons O
helps O
us O
to O
bring O
up O
students O
who O
are O
well O
- O
educated O
, O
with O
a O
bright O
and O
independent O
mind O
. O

Under O
suitable O
administration O
, O
tourism O
enhances O
local O
economic O
development O
Tourist O
trade O
is O
becoming O
a O
powerful O
engine O
for O
the O
economy O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
individuals O
believe O
that O
this O
position O
ignores O
the O
ecological O
and O
environmental O
destruction O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
tourist O
activities O
, O
and O
its O
adverse O
effects O
on O
local O
communities O

ecosystems O
. O

While O
both O
positions O
seem O
reasonable O
, O
my O
view O
is O
that O
, O
through B-claim
proper I-claim
management I-claim
and I-claim
regulation I-claim
, I-claim
a I-claim
booming I-claim
tourist I-claim
industry I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
excellent I-claim
source I-claim
of I-claim
economic I-claim
growth I-claim
and I-claim
wealth I-claim
for I-claim
rural I-claim
and I-claim
urban I-claim
areas I-claim
. O

The B-claim
most I-claim
obvious I-claim
merit I-claim
is I-claim
that I-claim
tourism I-claim
can I-claim
vastly I-claim
boost I-claim
economic I-claim
development I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
particular I-claim
state I-claim
or I-claim
region I-claim
. O

This B-premise
takes I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
through I-premise
direct I-premise
expenditure I-premise
from I-premise
tourists I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
because I-premise
it I-premise
provides I-premise
direct I-premise
and I-premise
indirect I-premise
jobs I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
community I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
retail I-premise

in I-premise
the I-premise

The B-premise
increasing I-premise
tax I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
expansion I-premise
of I-premise
local I-premise
markets I-premise
for I-premise
accommodation I-premise

luxury I-premise
goods I-premise
amongst I-premise
others I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
result I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
solid I-premise
, I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
regulated I-premise
tourism I-premise

Furthermore O
, O
tourism B-premise
provides I-premise
a I-premise
considerable I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
direct I-premise
and I-premise
indirect I-premise
jobs I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise

hotels I-premise
, I-premise
transport I-premise

and I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
service I-premise
industry I-premise

This B-premise
increase I-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
opportunities I-premise
allows I-premise
more I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
significant I-premise
contribution I-premise
to I-premise
society I-premise
through I-premise
the I-premise
purchasing I-premise
of I-premise
commodities I-premise
by I-premise
their I-premise
growing I-premise
incomes I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
this B-premise
gives I-premise
energy I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
cycle I-premise
, I-premise
generating I-premise
local I-premise
economic I-premise
prosperity I-premise

Some B-claim
people I-claim
may I-claim
oppose I-claim
these I-claim

citing I-claim
the I-claim
environmental I-claim

cultural I-claim
destruction I-claim
caused I-claim

tourism I-claim

In O
fact O

compared B-premise

the I-premise
tourism I-premise

other I-premise
alternatives I-premise

like I-premise
resource I-premise

On O
the O

the B-premise
dramatic I-premise
majority I-premise

those I-premise

It B-premise
is I-premise
illogical I-premise

believe I-premise
that I-premise
these I-premise
rational I-premise
folks I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
conduct I-premise
themselves I-premise
decently I-premise
if I-premise

After O
careful O

both O

the O

the B-claim
tourism I-claim
sector I-claim

desirable I-claim
for I-claim
its I-claim
important I-claim
socioeconomic I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
evident I-claim
that I-claim
under I-claim
suitable I-claim
administration I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
benefits I-claim
of I-claim
tourism I-claim
outweigh I-claim
its I-claim
drawbacks I-claim
. O

The O
government O

allocate O
more O

The O
issue O
of O

sparked O
a O
heated O
debate O

While O
some O
argue O
that O
the O
budget O
allocation O
to O
the O
arts O
is O
waste O
of O
national O
resources O
and O
the O
money O
should O
instead O
be O
spent O
on O
public O
services O
, O
I O
contend O
that O
this B-claim
investment I-claim
in I-claim
field I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
arts I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
interest I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
governments B-claim
are I-claim
liable I-claim
for I-claim
providing I-claim
societies I-claim
with I-claim
appropriate I-claim
public I-claim
services I-claim
and I-claim
adequate I-claim
facilities I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
efficient I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
no B-premise
one I-premise
should I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
any I-premise
sort I-premise
of I-premise
deficiency I-premise
in I-premise
field I-premise
of I-premise
health I-premise
, I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
transportation I-premise
and I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

However O
, O
these B-premise
could I-premise
only I-premise
help I-premise
individuals I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
physical I-premise
requirements I-premise
. O

There B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
burden I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
to I-premise
highly I-premise
concern I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
mental I-premise
health I-premise
initiatives I-premise
which I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
unconsciously I-premise
or I-premise
sensibly I-premise
provided I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
arts I-premise
. O

On O
top O
of O
this O
, O
the B-claim
arts I-claim
play I-claim
a I-claim
pivotal I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
all I-claim
- I-claim
round I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
. O

No B-premise

music I-premise
, I-premise
painting I-premise
, I-premise

other I-premise
fields I-premise
of I-premise

are I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise

consideration I-premise

Enriching B-premise
people I-premise

life I-premise

enlightening I-premise
their I-premise
thoughts I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise

basically I-premise
affect I-premise
the I-premise
enhancement I-premise
of I-premise
societies I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
positive I-premise
ways I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
investing B-claim
in I-claim
art I-claim
could I-claim
bring I-claim
employment I-claim
opportunities I-claim
and I-claim
could I-claim
end I-claim
in I-claim
return I-claim
of I-claim
capital I-claim
occasionally I-claim

The B-premise

the I-premise
values I-premise

as I-premise
a I-premise
matter I-premise

be I-premise
considered I-premise

national I-premise

To O
sum O
up O
, O
not B-claim
only I-claim
could I-claim
investing I-claim
in I-claim
art I-claim
be I-claim
considered I-claim
as I-claim
wasting I-claim
money I-claim
at I-claim
any I-claim
kind I-claim
, O
but O
also O
it B-claim
would I-claim
enriches I-claim
the I-claim
culture I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim

governments I-claim

individuals I-claim
would I-claim
benefit I-claim

it I-claim
in I-claim
multiple I-claim
ways I-claim

People O
are O
now O
more O

The O

the O
motto O

living O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
industrialization O
in O
the O
late O
19th O
century O
. O

People O
usually O
tend O
to O
have O
a O
single O
career O
as O
a O

of O

. O

However O
, O
a O
modern O

A B-premise
full I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
steady I-premise

enough I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
potential I-premise
employee I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise

But O
with B-premise
the I-premise
recent I-premise
recession I-premise

almost I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
countries I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
are I-premise
seeing I-premise
significant I-premise
economic I-premise
downfall I-premise
. O

This B-premise
overwhelming I-premise
crisis I-premise
is I-premise
prompting I-premise
delayering I-premise
and I-premise
reduction I-premise
of I-premise
workers I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people B-claim
are I-claim
focusing I-claim
on I-claim
doing I-claim
several I-claim
jobs I-claim
or I-claim
gaining I-claim
further I-claim
qualification I-claim
to I-claim
secure I-claim
their I-claim
economic I-claim
condition I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise
arrival I-premise
of I-premise
technology I-premise
has I-premise
also I-premise
been I-premise
playing I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
role I-premise
promoting I-premise

North B-premise
American I-premise
economists I-premise
have I-premise
published I-premise
reports I-premise
after I-premise
scrutinizing I-premise
the I-premise
recent I-premise
American I-premise
economic I-premise
situation I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
technology I-premise
is I-premise
eliminating I-premise
more I-premise
jobs I-premise
than I-premise
creating I-premise
one I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
robots B-premise
, I-premise
automation I-premise
and I-premise
softwares I-premise
are I-premise
taking I-premise
over I-premise
manual I-premise
human I-premise

such I-premise
as I-premise

specially I-premise
in I-premise
manufacturing I-premise

Thus O
many B-premise
people I-premise

jobs I-premise
are I-premise
now I-premise
at I-premise
high I-premise

. O

The B-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
ensure I-claim
a I-claim
flexible I-claim
earning I-claim
is I-claim
getting I-claim
more I-claim

. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
corporational B-premise
policy I-premise
to I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
less I-premise
to I-premise
inferiors I-premise
is I-premise
another I-premise
reason I-premise
that I-premise
drives I-premise

to I-premise
work I-premise
on I-premise
different I-premise
sectors I-premise
. O

For O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
people B-claim
are I-claim
now I-claim
more I-claim
conscious I-claim
to I-claim
gain I-claim
more I-claim
educational I-claim
qualification I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
interested I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
on I-claim
various I-claim
fields I-claim
simultaneously I-claim
to I-claim
earn I-claim
more I-claim

support I-claim
themselves I-claim

Nowadays O
human O
activities O

People O
use O
computer O
particularly O
for O
work O

However O
, O
many O
people O
argue O
that O
computer O
more O
give O

a O

Other O
sides O
believe O
that O
it O

and O
they O
can O
not O
do O
anything O
without O
that O
device O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
computer B-claim
can I-claim
influence I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
lives I-claim
have I-claim
already I-claim
been I-claim
controlled I-claim
by I-claim
device I-claim
. O

I O
would O
argue O
that O
this B-claim
modern I-claim
device I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
a I-claim
major I-claim
hindrance I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
people I-claim
. O

A B-premise
study I-premise
conducted I-premise
by I-premise
Mediabank I-premise
shows I-premise
that I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
Australian I-premise
adults I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
socialize I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
families I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
as I-premise
much I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they B-premise
spend I-premise
almost I-premise
nine I-premise
hours I-premise
a I-premise
day I-premise
dealing I-premise
with I-premise
computers I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
produce I-premise
efficient I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
working I-premise

As O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
example O
, O
the B-premise
idea I-premise
that I-premise
computers I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
help I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
neglected I-premise
. O

However O
, O
using B-claim
computer I-claim
can I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
easier I-claim
to I-claim
complete I-claim
their I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Businessmen B-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
use I-premise
computer I-premise
device I-premise

Communication B-premise

computer I-premise
such I-premise

businessmen I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
relation I-premise
even I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
country I-premise

This B-premise
is I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
using I-premise
computer I-premise
more I-premise
efficient I-premise

, I-premise
many I-premise
workers I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
do I-premise
more I-premise
in I-premise
work I-premise
without I-premise

In O
conclusion O
, O
in B-claim
era I-claim
technology I-claim
like I-claim
this I-claim
age I-claim

Firstly O

some O
people O
suggest O
that O

the I-claim

It B-premise

Social B-premise

been I-claim
recognized I-claim
by I-claim
increasing I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
employers I-claim
. O

It O
is O
because O
people B-premise
nowadays I-premise
are I-premise
required I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
jobs I-premise
frequently I-premise
. O

Interpersonal B-premise
skill I-premise
plays I-premise
an I-premise
essential I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
helping I-premise
colleagues I-premise
to I-premise
cooperate I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
when I-premise
conflicts I-premise
arise I-premise
. O

Better B-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
allow I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
resolve I-premise
disagreements I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
harmony I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
organization B-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
transformed I-premise
to I-premise
customers I-premise
oriented I-premise
. O

Excellent B-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
employees I-premise
maintain I-premise
strong I-premise
relationship I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
clients I-premise
which I-premise
thus I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
customer I-premise
satisfaction I-premise
. O

To O
my O
view O
, O
I O
incline O
to O
believe O
qualification B-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
the I-claim
fundamental I-claim
determinant I-claim
of I-claim
an I-claim
employee I-claim
's I-claim
competency I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

Yet O
, O
the B-claim
importance I-claim
of I-claim
social I-claim
skills I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
neglected I-claim
as I-claim
those I-claim
skills I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
one I-claim
to I-claim
perform I-claim
their I-claim
job I-claim
effectiveness I-claim
and I-claim
efficiency I-claim
by I-claim
facilitating I-claim

. O

International O
aid O

The O
world O
has O
become O
more O
prosperous O
than O
ever O
yet O
a O
great O
number O
of O
people O
are O
still O
living O
in O
poverty O
or O
suffering O
by O
wars O
or O
disasters O
. O

Charity O
organisations O
have O
been O
playing O
an O
important O
role O
to O
provide O
support O
to O
those O
people O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
controversial O
whether O
the O
help O
should O
go O
to O
the O
people O
who O
need O
it O
most O
or O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
country O
where O
the O
charity O
organisations O
are O
located O
. O

My O
view O
is O
that O
international B-claim
aid I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
prioritised I-claim
. O

International B-claim
aid I-claim
is I-claim
critical I-claim
because O
people B-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
facing I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
serious I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
African I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
living I-premise
below I-premise
the I-premise
basic I-premise
standards I-premise
. O

They B-premise
lack I-premise
food I-premise
, I-premise
water I-premise
or I-premise
clothes I-premise
which I-premise
keep I-premise
them I-premise
warm I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
mention I-premise
the I-premise
education I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

What B-premise
is I-premise
worse I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
countries I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
confronted I-premise
with I-premise
wars I-premise
or I-premise
natural I-premise
disasters I-premise
are I-premise
facing I-premise
even I-premise
more I-premise
severe I-premise
issues I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
security I-premise
, I-premise
homelessness I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
pain I-premise
of I-premise
losing I-premise
best I-premise
friends I-premise
or I-premise
family I-premise
members I-premise
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
those B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
desperate I-premise
need I-premise
of I-premise
international I-premise
support I-premise
. O

Despite O
the O
importance O
of O
helping O
those O
beyond O
our O
national O
borders O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
reasonable I-claim
to I-claim
lend I-claim
a I-claim
hand I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
fellow I-claim
citizens I-claim
. O

After O
all O
, O
charity B-premise
organisations I-premise
are I-premise
mainly I-premise
funded I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
home I-premise
country I-premise

thus O
there B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
high I-premise
demand I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
money I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
spent I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
place I-premise
where I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
collected I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
, O
even B-premise
within I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
developed I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
poor I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
lack I-premise
their I-premise
basic I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

By B-premise
solving I-premise
the I-premise
problems I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
home I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
beneficial I-premise
for I-premise
social I-premise
stability I-premise
and I-premise
steady I-premise
economic I-premise
growth I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
people B-claim
from I-claim
unfortunate I-claim
countries I-claim
need I-claim
more I-claim
international I-claim
assistance I-claim
while I-claim
helping I-claim
citizens I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
home I-claim
country I-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
necessary I-claim
. O

Popular O
events O
are O
essential O

A O
world O
sportive O
competition O
event O
is O
watched O
by O
almost O
every O
country O
around O
the O
world O
and O
provide O
social O
stimulus O
and O
people O
gathering O
. O

However O
, O
while O
people O
view O
these O
sportive O
events O
as O
vital O
in O
release O
international O
problems O
, O
others O
think O
that O
they O
are O
just O
entertainment O
to O
distract O
people O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
they B-claim
are I-claim
important I-claim
somehow I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
not I-claim
essential I-claim
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
world B-claim
sport I-claim
events I-claim
provide I-claim
positive I-claim
waves I-claim
for I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
. O

The B-premise
main I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
such I-premise
competitions I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
and I-premise
share I-premise
emotions I-premise
between I-premise
supporters I-premise
though I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
team I-premise
. O

These B-premise
emotions I-premise
are I-premise
shared I-premise
locally I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
village I-premise
or I-premise
city I-premise
, I-premise
nationally I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
own I-premise
country I-premise
but I-premise
even I-premise
internationally I-premise
too I-premise
. O

Obviously O
these B-premise
events I-premise
gather I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
nationalist I-premise
pride I-premise
feeling I-premise
is I-premise
increased I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
football I-premise
world I-premise
cup I-premise
taking I-premise
place I-premise
every I-premise
four I-premise
years I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
followed I-premise
event I-premise
during I-premise
which I-premise
everyone I-premise
is I-premise
having I-premise
fun I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
these B-claim
sports I-claim
events I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
essential I-claim
in I-claim
other I-claim
issues I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
politics I-claim
or I-claim
other I-claim
international I-claim
affairs I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
if B-premise
the I-premise
general I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
show I-premise
is I-premise
peaceful I-premise
and I-premise
fraternal I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
reality I-premise
is I-premise
different I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
this O
is O
the O
" O
calm O
before O
the O
storm O
" O
. O

After B-premise
the I-premise
Olympics I-premise
games I-premise
are I-premise
finished I-premise
, I-premise
everything I-premise
came I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
normal I-premise
and I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
game I-premise
competition I-premise
is I-premise
forgotten I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
. O

To O
picture O
it O
, O
recently B-premise
, I-premise
Putin I-premise
was I-premise
pleased I-premise
to I-premise
open I-premise
the I-premise
last I-premise
winter I-premise
Olympic I-premise
games I-premise
and I-premise
gather I-premise
international I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
actually I-premise
it I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
just I-premise
facade I-premise
and I-premise
Putin I-premise
did I-premise
n't I-premise
listen I-premise
international I-premise
warning I-premise
after I-premise
he I-premise
conquered I-premise
the I-premise
Crimea I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
an B-claim
international I-claim
sports I-claim
event I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
good I-claim
thing I-claim
to I-claim
gather I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
let I-claim
them I-claim
dream I-claim
, I-claim
being I-claim
proud I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
nationality I-claim
and I-claim
forget I-claim
problems I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
just I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
while I-claim
. O

These B-claim
meetings I-claim
are I-claim
in I-claim
none I-claim
case I-claim
here I-claim
to I-claim
interact I-claim
with I-claim
international I-claim

Distance O

not O
bring O
the O

offer O

With O
the O
tremendous O
development O
in O
information O

, O
long O
- O
distance O
education O
enables O
people O
to O
study O
at O
home O
without O
going O
to O

. O

Whether O
this O
teaching O
approach O
is O
more O
beneficial O
to O
pupils O
than O
the O
traditional O
way O
sparks O
off O
a O
heated O
debate O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
students B-claim
can I-claim
acquire I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
remote I-claim
education I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
studying B-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
pupils I-claim
enormous I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
considerable I-claim
expense I-claim
. O

Students B-premise
who I-premise
use I-premise
distance I-premise
- I-premise
learning I-premise
programs I-premise
can I-premise
cut I-premise
down I-premise
their I-premise
commuting I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
tuition I-premise
fees I-premise
, I-premise
textbook I-premise
fees I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
forth I-premise
just I-premise
by I-premise
an I-premise
internet I-premise
connection I-premise
. O

This B-premise
especially I-premise
makes I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
difference I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
far I-premise
- I-premise
off I-premise
countryside I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
whose I-premise
families I-premise
are I-premise
living I-premise
below I-premise
the I-premise
poverty I-premise
- I-premise
line I-premise
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
long B-claim
- I-claim
distance I-claim
education I-claim
provides I-claim
students I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
access I-claim
the I-claim
immense I-claim
knowledge I-claim
resources I-claim
and I-claim
a I-claim
variety I-claim
of I-claim
teaching I-claim
approaches I-claim
. O

Pupils B-premise
can I-premise
obtain I-premise
materials I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
curricula I-premise
just I-premise
by I-premise
one I-premise
mouse I-premise
click I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
science I-premise
reports I-premise
, I-premise
study I-premise
posts I-premise
, I-premise
documentary I-premise
records I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

A B-premise
student I-premise
can I-premise
even I-premise
select I-premise
a I-premise
specific I-premise
online I-premise
course I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
his I-premise
own I-premise
preference I-premise
and I-premise
time I-premise
schedule I-premise
so O
he B-premise
can I-premise
control I-premise
the I-premise
learning I-premise
progress I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
satisfactory I-premise
achievement I-premise
on I-premise
this I-premise
course I-premise
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
traditional B-claim
education I-claim
has I-claim
its I-claim
advantages I-claim
in I-claim
face I-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim
- I-claim
face I-claim
communication I-claim
, I-claim
mental I-claim
inspiration I-claim
and I-claim
physical I-claim
educations I-claim
. O

These B-premise
make I-premise
remarkable I-premise
contributions I-premise
in I-premise
providing I-premise
immediate I-premise
feedbacks I-premise
and I-premise
cultivating I-premise
pupils I-premise
' I-premise
personalities I-premise
. O

But O
with B-premise
the I-premise
improvements I-premise
in I-premise
streaming I-premise
and I-premise
sensor I-premise
technologies I-premise
, I-premise
remote I-premise
education I-premise
can I-premise
eliminate I-premise
the I-premise
obstacles I-premise
of I-premise
distance I-premise
and I-premise
body I-premise
contacts I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
concede O
that O
traditional B-claim
education I-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
merits I-claim
like I-claim
feedbacks I-claim
and I-claim
inspirations I-claim
that I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
replaced I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
near I-claim
future I-claim
. O

However O
, O
distance B-claim
- I-claim
learning I-claim
outweighs I-claim
the I-claim
conventional I-claim
way I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
with I-claim
its I-claim
efficiency I-claim
, I-claim
convenience I-claim
and I-claim
economic I-claim
value I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
self I-claim
- I-claim
regulated I-claim
education I-claim
that I-claim
pupils I-claim
can I-claim
study I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
purpose I-claim
. O

Every O
student O
either O
male O
or O
female O
should O
be O
given O
equal O
opportunity O

In O
today O
's O
context O
, O
education O
is O
the O
most O
significant O
factor O
which O
ultimately O
determines O
one O
's O
future O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
opinion O
, O
I O
am O
totally O
agreed O
with O
the O
view O
that O
there B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
any I-claim
room I-claim
for I-claim
partiality I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
gender I-claim
while I-claim
allocating I-claim
seats I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
university I-claim
courses I-claim
. O

There O
appear O
to O
be O
various O
reasons O
often O
strike O
in O
my O
mind O
in O
support O
of O
this O
position O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
judging B-claim
student I-claim
's I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
abilities I-claim
should I-claim
only I-claim
be I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
academic I-claim
qualifications I-claim
and I-claim
talents I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
gender I-claim
in I-claim
particular I-claim
. O

Nowadays O
, O
both B-premise
male I-premise
and I-premise
female I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
equally I-premise
competitive I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
and I-premise
deserve I-premise
to I-premise
produce I-premise
impressive I-premise
results I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
field I-premise
of I-premise
education I-premise
. O

In B-premise
India I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
female I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
often I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
grab I-premise
more I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
top I-premise
scorer I-premise
positions I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
year I-premise
higher I-premise
secondary I-premise
school I-premise
examinations I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
female B-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
highly I-claim
interested I-claim
in I-claim
learning I-claim
courses I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
mechanical I-claim
engineering I-claim
which I-claim
demands I-claim
physical I-claim
activities I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
lab I-claim
workshops I-claim
, I-claim
unlike I-claim
previous I-claim
generation I-claim
females I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
due B-premise
to I-premise
increasing I-premise
exposure I-premise
on I-premise
current I-premise
affairs I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
on I-premise
cutting I-premise
- I-premise
edge I-premise

developments I-premise
, I-premise
female I-premise
graduates I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
huge I-premise
responsibilities I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
workplace I-premise
, I-premise
despite I-premise
its I-premise
intensive I-premise
stress I-premise
and I-premise
pressure I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Chanda B-premise
Kochhar I-premise

who I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
CEO I-premise
of I-premise
India I-premise

the I-premise
country I-premise

most I-premise
powerful I-premise
female I-premise
head I-premise
in I-premise
business I-premise
sector I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
am O
firmly O
supporting O
the O
view O
, O
that O
every B-claim
student I-claim
either I-claim
male I-claim
or I-claim
female I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
given I-claim
fairly I-claim
equal I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
purse I-claim
their I-claim
education I-claim
in I-claim
all I-claim
university I-claim
subjects I-claim
, I-claim
provided I-claim
they I-claim
should I-claim
meet I-claim
the I-claim
required I-claim
qualifications I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
putting I-claim
limitations I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
gender I-claim
. O

Government O
should O
take O
interim O
measures O
, O
to O
regulate O
admission O
process O
for O
university O
courses O
which O
enables O
every O
student O
to O
get O
benefit O
. O

More O
convincing O
There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
face O

- O
face O
communication O
is O
better O
than O
other O
kinds O
of O
communication O
, O
and O
this O
topic O
can O
also O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O

its O
complexity O

Some O

the O
best O

I O

that O

I B-claim
agree I-claim
that I-claim
face I-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim
- I-claim
face I-claim
communication I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
communicating B-premise
in I-premise
person I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
convincing I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
, I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
convince I-premise
or I-premise
complain I-premise
someone I-premise
successfully I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
fitting I-premise
example I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
found I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
uncle I-premise
. O

He B-premise
once I-premise
complained I-premise
a I-premise
service I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
restaurant I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
exaggeration I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
directly I-premise
went I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
boss I-premise
and I-premise
told I-premise
the I-premise
boss I-premise
that I-premise
something I-premise
wrong I-premise
occurred I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
meal I-premise
-- I-premise
a I-premise
fly I-premise
concealed I-premise
in I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Afterward B-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
uncle I-premise
acquired I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
service I-premise
thanks I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

If B-premise
he I-premise
just I-premise
wrote I-premise
something I-premise
to I-premise
complain I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
website I-premise
or I-premise
by I-premise
telephone I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
think I-premise
this I-premise
problem I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
thought I-premise
important I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we B-claim
can I-claim
commence I-claim
to I-claim
agree I-claim
that I-claim
communicating I-claim
with I-claim
someone I-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
another O
equally O
crucible O
aspect O
is O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
deceived I-premise
without I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
had I-premise
received I-premise
some I-premise
harmful I-premise
words I-premise
on I-premise
facebook I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
best I-premise
friend I-premise
, I-premise
Eric I-premise
. O

He B-premise
said I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
totally I-premise
failed I-premise
in I-premise
building I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
friendship I-premise

and I-premise
he I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
anymore I-premise
. O

I B-premise
just I-premise
shocked I-premise
and I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
what I-premise
happened I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
I B-premise
realized I-premise
that I-premise
his I-premise
facebook I-premise
account I-premise
was I-premise
stolen I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we B-claim
are I-claim
capable I-claim
of I-claim
stating I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
talk I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
face I-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim

face I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
dissidents O
proclaiming O
that O
communication B-claim
by I-claim
letters I-claim
, I-claim
email I-claim
, I-claim
or I-claim
telephone I-claim
can I-claim
enable I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
talk I-claim
without I-claim
scruple I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
parts I-claim
in I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
limited O
understanding O

I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
conceivable I-premise
that I-premise
before I-premise
we I-premise
talk I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
imprudent I-premise
about I-premise
our I-premise
words I-premise
. O

Talking B-premise
without I-premise
scruple I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
indispensable I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
communication I-premise
; I-premise
in I-premise
contrast I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
usually I-premise
detrimental I-premise
to I-premise
us I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrated O
above O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
express I-claim
my I-claim
opinion I-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
because O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
are I-claim
qualitatively I-claim
greater I-claim
than I-claim
that I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
opposite I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I O
think O
the B-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
is I-claim
by I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
face I-claim

Still O

I O

the O

tenable O

Successful O
people O
do O
something O
new O

take O
risks O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
successful O
people O
usually O
take O
risk O
or O
try O
new O
things O
, O
and O
the O
topic O
can O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
believe O
that O
to O
be O
successful O
, O
they O
should O
do O
something O
they O
are O
unfamiliar O
with O
, O
while O
others O
seem O
to O
stand O
on O
the O
opposite O
place O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
develop O
my O
own O
perspective O
as O
well O
. O

I O
favor O
the O
latter O
; O
that O
is O
, O
successful B-claim
people I-claim
still I-claim
do I-claim
things I-claim
they I-claim
already I-claim
know I-claim
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
an O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
to B-premise
be I-premise
successful I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
all I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
risk I-premise
we I-premise
might I-premise
encounter I-premise
. O

The B-premise
lower I-premise
the I-premise
factors I-premise
making I-premise
us I-premise
fail I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
higher I-premise
probability I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
we I-premise
own I-premise
. O

Consider B-premise
a I-premise
circumstance I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
one I-premise
person I-premise
is I-premise
rich I-premise
because I-premise
he I-premise
knows I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
investment I-premise
. O

He B-premise
can I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
certain I-premise
companies I-premise
which I-premise
he I-premise
thinks I-premise
is I-premise
worth I-premise
it I-premise
to I-premise
invest I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
just I-premise
waits I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
not I-premise
so I-premise
high I-premise
but I-premise
constant I-premise
income I-premise
. O

He B-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
invest I-premise
some I-premise
dangerous I-premise
companies I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
higher I-premise
profit I-premise
which I-premise
might I-premise
lead I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
bankrupt I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
commence O
to O
agree O
that O
successful B-claim
people I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
try I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
or I-claim
take I-claim
risks I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
another O
equally O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
that O
it B-premise
depends I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
capability I-premise
of I-premise
one I-premise
to I-premise
decide I-premise
whether I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
succeed I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

At O
least O
, O
a B-premise
successful I-premise
person I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
dismantle I-premise
the I-premise
hurdles I-premise
prohibiting I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
sports I-premise
stars I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
some I-premise
drugs I-premise
to I-premise
win I-premise
a I-premise
game I-premise
or I-premise
show I-premise
their I-premise
extraordinary I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

The B-premise
same I-premise
reason I-premise
why I-premise
they I-premise
succeed I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
all I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
predominated I-premise
abilities I-premise
in I-premise
sports I-premise
realm I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
those B-premise
athletes I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
distinctive I-premise
performance I-premise
by I-premise
taking I-premise
risks I-premise
of I-premise
taking I-premise
drugs I-premise
are I-premise
failed I-premise
to I-premise
succeed I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim

something I-claim

because O
they B-premise
can I-premise
become I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
others I-premise

which I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
widely I-premise
accepted I-premise
idea I-premise

However O

Try B-premise

indeed I-premise

while B-premise
it I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise

Based O
on O

I O
believe O

what I-claim
we I-claim
already I-claim

In O

University O
education O
should O
be O
only O
available O
for O
good O
students O

The O
purpose O
of O
education O
is O
always O
a O
controversial O
topic O
among O
people O
and O
society O
, O
especially O
in O
high O
level O
such O
as O
college O
or O
university O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
all O
students O
should O
deserve O
to O
be O
educated O
at O
this O
level O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
leave I-claim
this I-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
training I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
certain I-claim
group I-claim
of I-claim
good I-claim
, I-claim
knowledgeable I-claim
learners I-claim
. O

First O
, O
focusing B-claim
only I-claim
on I-claim
talented I-claim
students I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
option I-claim
because O
it B-premise
helps I-premise
academic I-premise
institutions I-premise
maintain I-premise
their I-premise
high I-premise
education I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

Unlike B-premise
middle I-premise
school I-premise
or I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
university I-premise
and I-premise
college I-premise
require I-premise
far I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
ability I-premise
and I-premise
skills I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
an I-premise
enormous I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
complex I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some B-premise
students I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
capable I-premise
in I-premise
high I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
the I-premise
pressure I-premise
of I-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
tough I-premise
even I-premise
for I-premise
talented I-premise
ones I-premise
. O

That B-premise
explains I-premise
why I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
only I-premise
suitable I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
limited I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
opening I-premise
up I-premise
for I-premise
everyone I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
fatal I-premise
for I-premise
institutions I-premise
, O
since O
they B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
somehow I-premise
lower I-premise
the I-premise
materials I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
practical I-premise
for I-premise
everyone I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
university B-claim
should I-claim
only I-claim
accept I-claim
good I-claim
students I-claim
because O
it B-premise
gives I-premise
better I-premise
human I-premise
resources I-premise
for I-premise
sophisticated I-premise
purposes I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
this B-premise
may I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
' I-premise
social I-premise
division I-premise
' I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
someone I-premise
with I-premise
high I-premise
education I-premise
refuses I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
called I-premise
' I-premise
low I-premise
jobs I-premise
' I-premise
, O
but O
actually O
it B-premise
gives I-premise
no I-premise
harm I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
community I-premise
. O

Those B-premise
standard I-premise
jobs I-premise
will I-premise
always I-premise
be I-premise
available I-premise
for I-premise
everyone I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
complex I-premise
ones I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
only I-premise
handled I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
start I-premise
their I-premise
career I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
institutions I-premise
. O

I O
think O
limiting B-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
admitted I-premise
by I-premise
universities I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
choice I-premise
since O
it B-premise
will I-premise
reward I-premise
the I-premise
motivation I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
constantly I-premise
keep I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
difficult I-premise
level I-premise
of I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

Ultimately O
, O
this B-premise
improves I-premise
the I-premise
overall I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
education I-premise
and I-premise
gives I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
serve I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
necessary I-premise
needs I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
thing O
up O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
everyone B-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
compulsory I-claim
education I-claim
level I-claim
up I-claim
to I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
the I-claim
above I-claim
divisions I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
only I-claim
the I-claim
realm I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
students I-claim
. O

This B-claim
will I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
both I-claim
universities I-claim
and I-claim
students I-claim
, I-claim
thus I-claim
placing I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
positions I-claim
which I-claim
suit I-claim
them I-claim
most I-claim
. O

Improving O

the O

After O

that O

I B-claim

The O
first O

in O
an O

fact O
that O
the B-premise
more I-premise
advanced I-premise

we I-premise

the I-premise
more I-premise

we I-premise

tranquil I-premise
ambience I-premise
; I-premise
also I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
references I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
utilize I-premise
. O

With B-premise
this I-premise
convenient I-premise
and I-premise
versatile I-premise
facility I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
learning I-premise
condition I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
commence O
to O
agree O
that O
certain B-claim
facilities I-claim
are I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
another O
equally O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
that O
students B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
always I-premise
staying I-premise
in I-premise
classrooms I-premise
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
numerous I-premise
activities I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Consider B-premise
a I-premise
circumstance I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
member I-premise
of I-premise
jazz I-premise
ensemble I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
school I-premise
. O

He B-premise
must I-premise
need I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
auditorium I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
extraordinary I-premise
performance I-premise
. O

With B-premise
this I-premise
distinguished I-premise
performance I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
student I-premise
would I-premise
acquire I-premise
an I-premise
unforgettable I-premise
and I-premise
valuable I-premise
experience I-premise
burring I-premise
deeply I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
mind I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
students B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
school I-claim
to I-claim
spending I-claim
on I-claim
improving I-claim
facilities I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
people O
proclaiming O
that O
schools B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
hiring I-claim
prestigious I-claim
teachers I-claim
because O
they B-premise
can I-premise
impart I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
well I-premise
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
my O
limited O
understanding O
, O
I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
owing O
to O
its O
imprudence O
. O

A B-premise
student I-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
whether I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
teacher I-premise
but I-premise
is I-premise
decided I-premise
by I-premise
his I-premise
effort I-premise
on I-premise
study I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
useless I-premise
to I-premise
hire I-premise
a I-premise
super I-premise
famous I-premise
teacher I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
behaviors I-premise
as I-premise
sluggards I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrate O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
improving B-claim
facilities I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
school I-claim
because O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
are I-claim
relatively I-claim
greater I-claim
than I-claim
that I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
students B-claim
can I-claim
procure I-claim
more I-claim
advantages I-claim
from I-claim
better I-claim
facilities I-claim
. O

It O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
other O
points O
of O
view O
are O
completely O
without O
merit O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
an O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
reasons O
I O
have O
proposed O
in O
favor O
of O
my O
sentiment O
are O
much O
more O
tenable O
and O
cogent O
. O

High O
schools O
must O
be O
responsible O
for O
their O
future O
with O
well O
- O
planned O
curriculum O

Some O
people O
state O
that O
high O
schools O
should O
allow O
students O
to O
study O
what O
they O
want O
to O
. O

They O
believe O
this O
motivates O
students O
to O
study O
. O

I O
think O
, O
however O
, O
students B-claim
should I-claim
study I-claim
a I-claim
broad I-claim
range I-claim
of I-claim
subjects I-claim
from I-claim
literature I-claim
to I-claim
mathematics I-claim
. O

I O
believe O
that O
tertiary B-claim
education I-claim
should I-claim
make I-claim
students I-claim
prepare I-claim
for I-claim
specialization I-claim
at I-claim
university I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
extent I-claim
paternalistic I-claim
to I-claim
prevent I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
avoiding I-claim
hurdles I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
students B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
one I-claim
or I-claim
more I-claim
fields I-claim
of I-claim
study I-claim
in I-claim
which I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
really I-claim
interested I-claim
. O

They B-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
decide I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
major I-premise
without I-premise
trying I-premise
a I-premise
broad I-premise
range I-premise
of I-premise
subjects I-premise
, I-premise
otherwise I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
miss I-premise
valuable I-premise
encounter I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
subject I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
would I-premise
- I-premise
be I-premise
mathematician I-premise
student I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
strongly I-premise
intrigued I-premise
by I-premise
philosophy I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
field I-premise
. O

Next O
, O
students B-premise
should I-premise
obtain I-premise
knowledge I-premise
from I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
academic I-premise
fields I-premise
. O

General B-premise
education I-premise
plays I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
specialized I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Science B-premise
today I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
said I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
specialized I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
scientists I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
combine I-premise
knowledge I-premise
from I-premise
chemistry I-premise
to I-premise
physics I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
textbooks B-premise
used I-premise
in I-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
are I-premise
labelled I-premise
particular I-premise
subjects I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
fact I-premise
they I-premise
require I-premise
basic I-premise
understanding I-premise
of I-premise
other I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you B-premise
sometimes I-premise
need I-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
physics I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
a I-premise
text I-premise
on I-premise
chemistry I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
high B-claim
school I-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
learn I-claim
broadly I-claim
and I-claim
prepare I-claim
future I-claim
learning I-claim
at I-claim
university I-claim
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
students B-premise
have I-premise
tendency I-premise
to I-premise
shun I-premise
difficulties I-premise
. O

They B-premise
might I-premise
avoid I-premise
tough I-premise
courses I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
instead I-premise
attend I-premise
mainly I-premise
Mickey I-premise
Mouse I-premise
courses I-premise
and I-premise
enjoy I-premise
themselves I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
. O

This B-premise
might I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
limited I-premise
choices I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
schools B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
responsible I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
and I-claim
protect I-claim
them I-claim
. O

In O
summary O
, O
students B-claim
should I-claim
find I-claim
interesting I-claim
subjects I-claim
and I-claim
acquire I-claim
general I-claim
knowledge I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
higher I-claim
education I-claim
at I-claim
tertiary I-claim
education I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
high O
school O
must O
be O
responsible O
for O
their O
future O
with O

planned O
curriculum O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
games O
for O
adults O
comparing O
to O
children O
As O
people O
grow O
up O
, O
the O
arguments O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
games O
arise O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
, O
adults O
need O
playing O
games O
as O
children O
do O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
games B-claim
are I-claim
no I-claim
longer I-claim
too I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
games B-claim
become I-claim
unnecessary I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
when I-claim
their I-claim
careers I-claim
begin I-claim
. O

Someone B-premise
may I-premise
argue I-premise
that I-premise
games I-premise
help I-premise
adults I-premise
relax I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
balanced I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
. O

But O
, O
more B-premise
often I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
pressure I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
family I-premise
commitment I-premise
force I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
abandon I-premise
their I-premise
lifelong I-premise
hobbies I-premise
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
spend I-premise
enough I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
effort I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
games I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
in I-premise
15 I-premise
or I-premise
20 I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
except I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
minor I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
professional I-premise
athletes I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
stop I-premise
playing I-premise
games I-premise
seriously I-premise
as I-premise
soon I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
decent I-premise
job I-premise
. O

They B-premise
often I-premise
feel I-premise
that I-premise
such I-premise
games I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
troublesome I-premise
than I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
daily I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
should O
be O
mentioned O
is O
that O
adults B-claim
often I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
pursue I-claim
games I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
competitive I-claim
activity I-claim
, I-claim
while I-claim
children I-claim
are I-claim
always I-claim
keen I-claim
on I-claim
competition I-claim
and I-claim
winning I-claim
. O

For B-premise
youngsters I-premise
, I-premise
maintaining I-premise
their I-premise
desire I-premise
to I-premise
win I-premise
often I-premise
develops I-premise
many I-premise
outstanding I-premise
characteristics I-premise
whether I-premise
they I-premise
participate I-premise
sport I-premise
events I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
younger I-premise
sister I-premise
likes I-premise
fencing I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
thanks I-premise
to I-premise
her I-premise
desire I-premise
to I-premise
win I-premise
, I-premise
she I-premise
never I-premise
gives I-premise
up I-premise
when I-premise
facing I-premise
a I-premise
difficult I-premise
situation I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
becoming I-premise
hurt I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
adults B-premise
often I-premise
consider I-premise
such I-premise
behaviors I-premise
as I-premise
childish I-premise
and I-premise
drop I-premise
them I-premise
immediately I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
a B-premise
competitive I-premise
person I-premise
usually I-premise
finds I-premise
it I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
cooperate I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
colleagues I-premise
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
they B-premise
no I-premise
longer I-premise
play I-premise
games I-premise
for I-premise
any I-premise
moderate I-premise
achievements I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
gradually I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
interest I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
think O
adults B-claim
do I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
play I-claim
games I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
their I-claim
styles I-claim
are I-claim
often I-claim
distinct I-claim
from I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
often I-claim
less I-claim
competitive I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
enjoyable I-claim
. O

Along B-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
high I-claim
requirement I-claim
for I-claim
family I-claim
and I-claim
work I-claim
, I-claim
games I-claim
are I-claim
just I-claim
some I-claim
leisure I-claim
activities I-claim
for I-claim
adults I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
something I-claim
necessary I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
meant I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
. O

not O
have O

However O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
a B-claim
single I-claim
modern I-claim
culture I-claim
is I-claim
being I-claim
created I-claim
by I-claim
modern I-claim
technology I-claim
for O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
most B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
countries I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim

Teachers B-premise

research I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise

then I-premise
students I-premise
should I-premise
type I-premise
their I-premise
research I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
computer I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
give I-premise
a I-premise

using I-premise
PowerPoint I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
who I-premise

Iran I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise

their I-premise

Secondly O
, O
new B-claim
technology I-claim

some I-claim
similar I-claim

all I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim

. O

Computer B-premise
technology I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
growing I-premise
job I-premise
in I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
countries I-premise

and I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
being I-premise
encouraged I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
field I-premise
. O

For O

many B-premise

in I-premise

the I-premise

go I-premise

Canadian I-premise
universities I-premise

This O

that O
jobs B-premise
that I-premise

are I-premise
in I-premise
demand I-premise
in I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
there B-claim

some I-claim
cultures I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
making I-claim

in I-claim
each I-claim
culture I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
technology I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
affect I-claim
them I-claim
. O

This O
point O
has O
some O
merits O
on O
the O
surface O

however O
, O
many B-premise
countries I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Canada I-premise

the I-premise
USA I-premise

British I-premise

many I-premise
restaurants I-premise

In O

For O

in O
my O

reading B-claim

for O
the O

is I-premise
a I-premise
story I-premise
of I-premise
Russian I-premise
revolution I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
understand I-premise
the I-premise
leaders I-premise
and I-premise
different I-premise
segments I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
Russian I-premise
people I-premise
. O

However O
, O
a B-premise
movie I-premise
just I-premise
gives I-premise
us I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
small I-premise
review I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
stories I-premise
and I-premise
characters I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
reading B-claim
a I-claim
novel I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
convenient I-claim
. O

Some B-premise
novels I-premise
have I-premise
around I-premise
100 I-premise
pages I-premise
and I-premise
readers I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
finish I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
just I-premise
one I-premise
hour I-premise
. O

Yet B-premise
these I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
continue I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
their I-premise
novels I-premise
wherever I-premise
they I-premise
find I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
in I-premise
bus I-premise
or I-premise
trains I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
have I-premise
started I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
a I-premise
novel I-premise
since I-premise
last I-premise
week I-premise
. O

I B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
enough I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
read I-premise
a I-premise
novel I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
I I-premise
usually I-premise
read I-premise
it I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
coming I-premise
home I-premise
from I-premise
English I-premise
class I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
watch I-premise
a I-premise
complete I-premise
movie I-premise
because O
I B-premise
can I-premise
just I-premise
sit I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
TV I-premise
for I-premise
15 I-premise
minutes I-premise
and I-premise
after I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
people B-claim
enjoy I-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
when O
they O
know O
they B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
many I-premise
things I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
learning I-premise
a I-premise
language I-premise
by I-premise
watching I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

This O
point O
has O
some O
merits O
on O
the O
surface O
; O
however O
, O
movies B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
idea I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
language I-premise
for I-premise
beginners I-premise
since O
characters B-premise
in I-premise
movies I-premise
speak I-premise
very I-premise
fast I-premise
and I-premise
unclear I-premise
for I-premise
language I-premise
learners I-premise
. O

For B-premise
these I-premise
learners I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
to I-premise
start I-premise
by I-premise
reading I-premise
some I-premise
novels I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
comprehensible I-premise
and I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
reading B-claim
fictions I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
pleasant I-claim
because O
these B-claim
books I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
depth I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
much I-claim
easier I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
useful I-claim
for I-claim
language I-claim
learners I-claim
. O

Various O
local O
languages O
are O
becoming O
extinct O
Today O
, O
English O
is O
commonly O
used O
language O
across O
the O
world O
. O

Its O
usage O
is O
increasing O
day O
by O
day O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
various O
local O
languages O
are O
becoming O
extinct O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
change O
and O
would O
help O
people O
to O
easily O
communicate O
. O

While O
there O
are O
others O
who O
disagree O
with O
this O
and O
are O
more O
concerned O
about O
dying O
local O
languages O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
using B-claim
single I-claim
language I-claim
through I-claim
out I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
change I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
helping I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
place I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
. O

A B-claim
world I-claim
with I-claim
fewer I-claim
languages I-claim
helps I-claim
us I-claim
interact I-claim
with I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Due B-premise
to I-premise
globalization I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
traveling I-premise
for I-premise
professional I-premise
trips I-premise
. O

So O
, O
communicating B-premise
in I-premise
single I-premise
language I-premise
will I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
problems I-premise
of I-premise
travelers I-premise
in I-premise
daily I-premise
activities I-premise
like I-premise
ordering I-premise
food I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
restaurant I-premise
or I-premise
in I-premise
going I-premise
around I-premise
places I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students B-premise
who I-premise
migrate I-premise
for I-premise
better I-premise
education I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
through I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
stress I-premise
as O
they B-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
make I-premise
new I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
any I-premise
discussions I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
otherwise I-premise
not I-premise
possible I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
world I-premise
with I-premise
multiple I-premise
languages I-premise
; I-premise
this I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
makes I-premise
it I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
adjust I-premise
in I-premise
new I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

Single B-premise
language I-premise
also I-premise
reduces I-premise
misunderstandings I-premise
between I-premise
people I-premise
. O

Adding O
to O
that O
, O
exchange B-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
sectors I-premise
of I-premise
research I-premise
like I-premise
electronics I-premise
, I-premise
medical I-premise
, I-premise
astronomy I-premise
etc I-premise
would I-premise
become I-premise
easier I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
few B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
worried I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
dying I-claim
local I-claim
languages I-claim
. O

These B-premise
languages I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
basis I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
origination I-premise
and I-premise
initial I-premise
communication I-premise
between I-premise
different I-premise
cultures I-premise
. O

They B-premise
represent I-premise
local I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

As B-premise
the I-premise
usage I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
languages I-premise
decrease I-premise
, I-premise
culture I-premise
also I-premise
changes I-premise
accordingly I-premise
. O

Further O
, O
these B-premise
languages I-premise
are I-premise
tightly I-premise
coupled I-premise
with I-premise
history I-premise
; I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
olden I-premise
day I-premise
literature I-premise
and I-premise
scripts I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
impossible I-premise
to I-premise
decipher I-premise
if I-premise
these I-premise
languages I-premise
are I-premise
lost I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
believe O
change B-claim
is I-claim
inevitable I-claim
and I-claim
that I-claim
usage I-claim
of I-claim
one I-claim
language I-claim
across I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
one I-claim
. O

We O
have O
to O
accept O
these O
changes O
for O
a O
world O
to O
be O
a O
better O
place O
. O

Communication B-claim
in I-claim
single I-claim
language I-claim
would I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
productivity I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
and I-claim
brings I-claim
everyone I-claim
on I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
page I-claim
. O

Do O
you O
believe O
that O
elderly O
people O
used O
to O
live O
in O
a O
better O
world O
? O

Changes O
are O
inseparable O
parts O
of O
this O
world O
which O
normally O
humans O
are O
responsible O
for O
by O
manipulating O
the O
environment O
they O
live O

Sometimes O
these O
changes O
adversely O
affect O
our O
lives O
that O
make O
elderly O
people O
think O
they O
used O
to O
live O
in O
a O
better O
world O
than O
the O
modern O
world O
the O
younger O
generation O
are O
experiencing O
. O

I O
utterly O
disagree O
with O
this O
opinion O
due O
to O
technological O
and O
medical O
reasons O
. O

We B-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
era I-claim
that I-claim
technology I-claim
is I-claim
developing I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
speed I-claim
of I-claim
light I-claim
, I-claim
steering I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
toward I-claim
a I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
convenient I-claim
place I-claim
. O

A B-premise
clear I-premise
- I-premise
cut I-premise
example I-premise
that I-premise
supports I-premise
this I-premise
idea I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
invention I-premise
of I-premise
smart I-premise
phones I-premise
. O

The B-premise
strong I-premise
navigation I-premise
system I-premise
installed I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
phones I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
rescued I-premise
lives I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
who I-premise
left I-premise
alone I-premise
in I-premise
remote I-premise
areas I-premise
like I-premise
forests I-premise
or I-premise
deserts I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
criticize I-premise
social I-premise
networks I-premise
as I-premise
tools I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
ruined I-premise
true I-premise
relationships I-premise
and I-premise

by I-premise
reducing I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
though O
, O
social B-premise
networks I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Facebook I-premise
could I-premise
foster I-premise
the I-premise
ties I-premise
between I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
family I-premise
members I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
obligatorily I-premise
far I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
by I-premise
keeping I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
touch I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
thing I-premise
that I-premise
was I-premise
impossible I-premise
less I-premise
than I-premise
20 I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
. O

The B-premise
phenomenal I-premise
progress I-premise
in I-premise
medical I-premise
science I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
last I-premise
decade I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
achievement I-premise
for I-premise
human I-premise
being I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
a I-premise
healthier I-premise
and I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
happier I-premise
place I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
. O

Today O
, O
even B-premise
some I-premise
disabled I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
serious I-premise
vertebral I-premise
injuries I-premise
can I-premise
start I-premise
doing I-premise
physical I-premise
activities I-premise
like I-premise
walking I-premise
again I-premise
thanks I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
continuingly I-premise
efforts I-premise
of I-premise
biomechanical I-premise

neurologists I-premise
. O

The B-premise
advancement I-premise
in I-premise
drug I-premise
delivery I-premise
systems I-premise
is I-premise
another I-premise
example I-premise
that I-premise
could I-premise
save I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

To O
be O
specific O
, O
scientists B-premise
could I-premise
invent I-premise
ways I-premise

drugs I-premise
directly I-premise

the I-premise

is I-premise
a I-premise
miraculous I-premise

. O

In O

the B-claim

from I-claim
50 I-claim

a I-claim
strong I-claim
evidence I-claim

how I-claim

In O
conclusion O

even O

the B-claim
people I-claim

I O
think O

they B-premise
judge I-premise
the I-premise
contemporary I-premise

In O
light O
of O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
facts O

one O
can O
easily O
conclude O
that O
in B-claim
the I-claim
current I-claim
world I-claim
living I-claim
standards I-claim
stand I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
much I-claim
higher I-claim
level I-claim

in I-claim
better I-claim
conditions I-claim
socially I-claim

Higher O
school O
students O
should O
be O
taught O
how O
to O
manage O
money O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
money O
has O
become O
key O
ingredient O
in O
various O
walks O
of O
our O
life O
than O
before O
. O

Teaching O
financial O
management O
to O
juvenile O
students O
is O
always O
a O
topic O
of O
debate O
. O

Some O
people O
feel O
that O
teaching O
money O
management O
skill O
to O
teenage O
students O
will O
help O
them O
realise O
the O
importance O
of O
money O
, O
while O
few O
feel O
that O
exposing O
children O
to O
money O
math O
at O
this O
age O
may O
turn O
fatal O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
agree O
to O
that O
fact O
that O
higher B-claim
school I-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
made I-claim
aware I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
money I-claim
management I-claim
. O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
think O
teenage B-claim
students I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
understand I-claim
the I-claim
money I-claim
management I-claim
basics I-claim
is O
, O
primarily O
when B-premise
secondary I-premise
school I-premise
students I-premise
attain I-premise
the I-premise
age I-premise
of I-premise
undergoing I-premise
graduation I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
ought I-premise
to I-premise
stay I-premise
in I-premise
hostels I-premise
or I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
family I-premise
, I-premise
during I-premise
such I-premise
situations I-premise
when I-premise
money I-premise
management I-premise
is I-premise
taught I-premise
at I-premise
an I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
increased I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
responsibility I-premise
and I-premise
confidence I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
while B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
kid I-premise
my I-premise
father I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
expense I-premise
log I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
month I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
asked I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
keep I-premise
track I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
pocket I-premise
money I-premise
expenses I-premise
, I-premise
during I-premise
my I-premise
future I-premise
course I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
this I-premise
became I-premise
a I-premise
practice I-premise
and I-premise
helped I-premise
me I-premise
in I-premise
planning I-premise
my I-premise
expenses I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
if B-premise
financial I-premise
management I-premise
is I-premise
taught I-premise
at I-premise
an I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
better I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
understanding I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
financial I-premise
background I-premise
and I-premise
status I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
coming I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
unrealistic I-premise
whims I-premise
and I-premise
fancies I-premise
are I-premise
minimized I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
buying B-premise
a I-premise
gaming I-premise
console I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
deal I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
from I-premise
an I-premise
affluent I-premise
financial I-premise
background I-premise
. O

However O
, O
for B-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
coming I-premise
from I-premise
middle I-premise
class I-premise
buying I-premise
a I-premise
gaming I-premise
console I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
need I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
hour I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
having B-claim
exposed I-claim
to I-claim
money I-claim
management I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
school I-claim
level I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
in I-claim
prioritizing I-claim
the I-claim
financial I-claim
commitments I-claim
efficiently I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
students B-claim
understanding I-claim
the I-claim
money I-claim
management I-claim
techniques I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
positive I-claim
effects I-claim
than I-claim
negative I-claim
impact I-claim
. O

However O
, O
the O
teaching O
should O
be O
in O
a O
constructive O
manner O
and O
students O
should O
not O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
being O
bullied O
for O
every O
expense O
. O

Smoking O
should O
not O
be O
permitted O
in O
restaurants O
Generally O
speaking O
, O
smoking O
is O
never O
been O
good O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
researches O
done O
to O
prove O
that O
a O
cigar O
contains O
harmful O
ingredients O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

Although O
many O
smokers O
claim O
that O
they O
need O
to O
smoke O
in O
order O
to O
work O
more O
effectively O
or O
to O
think O
more O
creatively O
, O
those O
reasons O
never O
proves O
that O
smoking O
has O
any O
benefits O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
smoking B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
permitted I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
public I-claim
places I-claim
like I-claim
restaurants I-claim
because O
it B-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
non I-claim
- I-claim
smokers I-claim
breathe I-claim
uncomfortably I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
restaurants B-premise
are I-premise
places I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
come I-premise
and I-premise
pay I-premise
some I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
their I-premise
meals I-premise
. O

Smoking B-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
will I-claim
absolutely I-claim
disturb I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
enjoying I-claim
their I-claim
meals I-claim
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
their I-premise
meals I-premise
while I-premise
breathing I-premise
in I-premise
smoke I-premise
around I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
restaurants B-premise
are I-premise
places I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
usually I-premise
come I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
families I-premise
. O

This O
means O
, O
there B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
children I-premise
, I-premise
grandparents I-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
pregnant I-premise
women I-premise
inside I-premise
the I-premise
restaurants I-premise
. O

Smoking B-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
can I-claim
give I-claim
a I-claim
bad I-claim
example I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
children I-claim
. O

Children B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
high I-premise
potential I-premise
to I-premise
imitate I-premise
what I-premise
adults I-premise
do I-premise
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
really I-premise
high I-premise
curiosity I-premise
towards I-premise
something I-premise
. O

Smoking B-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
also I-claim
can I-claim
affect I-claim
the I-claim
elders I-claim
' I-claim
health I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
problems I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
hearts I-claim
and I-claim
lungs I-claim
. O

The B-premise
most I-premise
dangerous I-premise
people I-premise
that I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
affected I-premise
by I-premise
smoke I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
pregnant I-premise
women I-premise
because O
they B-premise
will I-premise
breathe I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
contaminated I-premise
air I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
disrupt I-premise
the I-premise
growth I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
babies I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
passive B-premise
smokers I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
health I-premise
risks I-premise
. O

When B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
active I-premise
smokers I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
inhale I-premise
hazardous I-premise
smoke I-premise
. O

Stroke B-premise
, I-premise
heart I-premise
disorders I-premise
, I-premise
hearing I-premise
loss I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
cancers I-premise
are I-premise
some I-premise
diseases I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
attack I-premise
passive I-premise
smokers I-premise
. O

Personally O
speaking O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
unfair I-claim
for I-claim
passive I-claim
smokers I-claim
because O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
smoke I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
same I-premise
health I-premise
risks I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
active I-premise
one I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
smoking B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
permitted I-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
because O
there B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
get I-claim
disadvantaged I-claim
. O

State O
laws O
that O
prohibit O
it O
should O
be O
upheld O
so O
the O
restaurant O
' O
management O
can O
make O
a O
clear O
rule O
in O
their O
restaurants O
because O
everyone O
has O
a O
right O
to O
enjoy O
their O
meals O
. O

Growing O
violence O
in O
films O
has O
affected O
youngsters O
in O
a O
negative O
way O
? O

It O
's O
obvious O
that O
violent O
behavior O
is O
growing O
more O
in O
films O
in O
recent O
20 O
years O
. O

This O
matter O
has O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
way O
to O
advertise O
a O
film O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
violence B-claim
in I-claim
movies I-claim
has I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
youngsters I-claim
mostly I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
behaviors I-claim
, I-claim
emotions I-claim
& I-claim
study I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
children B-premise
behaviors I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
concerning I-premise
matter I-premise
which I-premise
parents I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
trying I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
involved I-premise
in I-premise
TV I-premise
programs I-premise
. O

Imagine B-premise
an I-premise
actor I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
’s I-premise
favorite I-premise
is I-premise
doing I-premise
violent I-premise
roles I-premise
. O

In B-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
child I-premise
would I-premise
imitate I-premise
the I-premise
actor I-premise
's I-premise
behaviors I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
look I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
him I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
unexpectedly B-claim
the I-claim
violent I-claim
behavior I-claim
has I-claim
effected I-claim
on I-claim
child I-claim
’s I-claim
behaviors I-claim
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
human B-premise
beings I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
sensitive I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
of I-premise
youngsters I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
dying B-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
a I-premise
disappointing I-premise
happening I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
killing B-premise
is I-premise
worse I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
if B-claim
these I-claim
scenes I-claim
are I-claim
in I-claim
TV I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
would I-claim
probably I-claim
have I-claim
their I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
viewer I-claim
who I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
. O

Finally O
, O
beside O
all O
above O
mentioned O
items O
, O
the B-premise
study I-premise
of I-premise
youngsters I-premise
shall I-premise
always I-premise
been I-premise
controlled I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
child I-premise
watches I-premise
a I-premise
frightening I-premise
movie I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he B-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

In O
this O
condition O
, O
because O
he B-premise
is I-premise
thinking I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
movie I-premise
or I-premise
whatever I-premise
has I-premise
happened I-premise
in I-premise
it I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
obvious I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
n’t I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
concentrate I-premise
on I-premise
his I-premise
study I-premise
perfectly I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
the B-claim
study I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
youngster I-claim
would I-claim
affected I-claim
terribly I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
certainly O
can O
say O
that O
growing B-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
in I-claim
films I-claim
have I-claim
definitely I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
youngsters I-claim
mostly I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
study I-claim
, I-claim
emotions I-claim
and I-claim
behaviors I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
think O
this O
matter O
should O
be O
controlled O
by O
parents O
or O
somehow O
by O
directors O
. O

Gossip O
- O
based O
information O

Nowadays O
information O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
our O
world O
. O

It O
has O
become O
a O
product O
, O
which O
can O
be O
sold O
, O
bought O
, O
or O
stolen O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
: O
" O
information B-claim
is I-claim
power I-claim
" O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
to O
be O
well O
- O
informed O
. O

I O
consider O
the O
statement O
above O
to O
be O
right O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
by B-claim
using I-claim
different I-claim
sources I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
guarantee I-claim
its I-claim
reliability I-claim
. O

Some B-premise
people I-premise
may I-premise
disinform I-premise
you I-premise
on I-premise
purpose I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
's I-premise
why I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
rather I-premise
unwise I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
conclusions I-premise
before I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
confident I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Russian B-premise
news I-premise
announced I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
war I-premise
between I-premise
Osetia I-premise
and I-premise
Georgia I-premise
had I-premise
been I-premise
initiated I-premise
by I-premise
Georgia I-premise
, I-premise
however I-premise
, I-premise
european I-premise
news I-premise
announced I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
initiated I-premise
by I-premise
Russia I-premise
. O

After B-premise
a I-premise
while I-premise
the I-premise
situation I-premise
became I-premise
clear I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
before I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
had I-premise
already I-premise
condemned I-premise
the I-premise
actions I-premise
of I-premise
Russia I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
facts I-premise
about I-premise
some I-premise
events I-premise
or I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
estimations I-premise
, O
because O
it B-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
you I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise
conclusion I-premise
or I-premise
estimate I-premise
. O

Sometimes O
it O
can O
be O
really O
difficult O
to O
find O
out O
the O
facts O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
internet O
, O
that O
's O
why O
you B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
look I-claim
through I-claim
different I-claim
sources I-claim
before I-claim
you I-claim
manage I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
some I-claim
reliable I-claim
facts I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
possible I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
wrong I-premise
decision I-premise
because O
you B-premise
have I-premise
just I-premise
used I-premise
someone I-premise
's I-premise
personal I-premise
opinion I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
actually I-premise
wrong I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
several B-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
in I-premise
Moscow I-premise
salt I-premise
became I-premise
two I-premise
times I-premise
more I-premise
expensive I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
week I-premise
, I-premise
because I-premise
people I-premise
thought I-premise
that I-premise
soon I-premise
there I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
no I-premise
salt I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
shops I-premise
. O

The B-premise
gossip I-premise
- I-premise
based I-premise
information I-premise
dramatically I-premise
influenced I-premise
the I-premise
prices I-premise
and I-premise
only I-premise
after I-premise
official I-premise
announcement I-premise
the I-premise
" I-premise
salt I-premise
- I-premise
panic I-premise
" I-premise
was I-premise
over I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
confident I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
you I-claim
use I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
when I-claim
your I-claim
conclusion I-claim
or I-claim
decision I-claim
may I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
influence I-claim
. O

Old O
buildings O
should O
be O
preserved O
The O
preservation O
of O
old O
buildings O
always O
is O
a O
large O
question O
for O
governments O
because O
conflict O
between O
the O
issues O
of O
housing O
for O
citizens O
and O
the O
protection O
of O
our O
culture O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
all B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
old I-claim
building I-claim
which I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
sense I-claim
of I-claim
culture I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
conserved I-claim
. O

There O
are O
different O
reasons O
which O
persuade O
that O
people O
should O
not O
restore O
old O
buildings O
. O

As B-premise
a I-premise
result I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
rapid I-premise
urbanization I-premise
process I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
rural I-premise
people I-premise
must I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
urban I-premise
centers I-premise
to I-premise
look I-premise
for I-premise
job I-premise
opportunities I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
question I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
preservation I-premise
of I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
has I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
pressing I-premise
. O

Because O
of O
that O
need O
, O
governments B-claim
can I-claim
construct I-claim
more I-claim
accommodation I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
preserving I-claim
old I-claim
buildings I-claim
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
the B-premise
preservation I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
expensive I-premise
because I-premise
all I-premise
components I-premise
of I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
have I-premise
historical I-premise
values I-premise
. O

Old B-premise
buildings I-premise
are I-premise
an I-premise
essential I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
history I-premise
. O

Tourist B-premise
often I-premise
decide I-premise
to I-premise
discover I-premise
the I-premise
culture I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
visit I-premise
through I-premise
those I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
managers B-claim
of I-claim
cities I-claim
can I-claim
earn I-claim
more I-claim
money I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
attraction I-claim
provided I-claim
by I-claim
old I-claim
buildings I-claim
and I-claim
that I-claim
amount I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
spent I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
conservation I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
preservation I-premise
of I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
ways I-premise
to I-premise
conserve I-premise
our I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
everyone I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
much I-premise
from I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Old B-claim
buildings I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
used I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
culture I-claim
museums I-claim
and I-claim
provide I-claim
accommodation I-claim
with I-claim
more I-claim
convenient I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
live I-claim
there I-claim
. O
. O

Many B-claim
cities I-claim
have I-claim
development I-claim
strategies I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
city I-claim
contains I-claim
both I-claim
unique I-claim
and I-claim
modern I-claim
beauty I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
that I-claim
preservation I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
finish I-claim
half I-claim
of I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Overall O
, O
both O
of O
those O
view O
have O
strong O
arguments O
: O
the O
need O
for O
housing O
or O
the O
expense O
of O
restoration O
contrast O
with O
our O
desire O
to O
conserve O
culture O
and O
attract O
tourism O
. O

So O
I O
think O
we B-claim
should I-claim
restore I-claim
those I-claim
building I-claim
because O
old B-claim
buildings I-claim
process I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
outstanding I-claim
feature I-claim
of I-claim
areas I-claim
which I-claim
contain I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Popularity O
of O
mobile O
phones O
to O
young O
people O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
young O
people O
consider O
mobile O
phone O
as O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
their O
lives O
as O
it O
keeps O
them O
constantly O
organized O
and O
it O
provides O
much O
convenience O
for O
them O
to O
reach O
out O
their O
families O
and O
friends O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
aspects O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the B-claim
popularity I-claim
of I-claim
mobile I-claim
phones I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
generation I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
bad I-claim
development I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many B-claim
young I-claim
owners I-claim
of I-claim
cellular I-claim
phones I-claim
are I-claim
struggling I-claim
at I-claim
school I-claim
because I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
distracted I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
phones I-claim
. O

Games B-premise
and I-premise
applications I-premise
installed I-premise
in I-premise
phones I-premise
have I-premise
occupied I-premise
much I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
leaving I-premise
them I-premise
lesser I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
school I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Similarly O
, O
internet B-premise
capable I-premise
phones I-premise
help I-premise
influence I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
ones I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
chatting I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
sites I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
doing I-premise
school I-premise
works I-premise
. O

In B-premise
my I-premise
college I-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
once I-premise
addicted I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
game I-premise
on I-premise
my I-premise
cellular I-premise
phone I-premise
. O

I B-premise
have I-premise
spent I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise
trying I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
a I-premise
higher I-premise
level I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
- I-premise
off I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

That B-premise
goal I-premise
has I-premise
led I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
lost I-premise
in I-premise
interest I-premise
on I-premise
doing I-premise
my I-premise
homework I-premise

and I-premise
I I-premise
ended I-premise
up I-premise
failing I-premise
one I-premise
subject I-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
semester I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
juveniles B-claim
who I-claim
possess I-claim
mobile I-claim
phones I-claim
have I-claim
great I-claim
tendencies I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
materialistic I-claim
. O

They B-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
purchase I-premise
a I-premise
phone I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
functionality I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
for I-premise
its I-premise
brand I-premise
. O

Relatively O
, O
these B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
come I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
and I-premise
inexpensive I-premise
cost I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
most B-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
juveniles I-premise
are I-premise
students I-premise
so O
they B-premise
would I-premise
need I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
them I-premise
financially I-premise
for I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
. O

An B-premise
illustration I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
unfortunate I-premise
trend I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
almost I-premise
everywhere I-premise
these I-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
wherein I-premise
most I-premise
teens I-premise
at I-premise
an I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
own I-premise
phones I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
worth I-premise
twice I-premise
the I-premise
salary I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

This O
clearly O
shows O
that O
the B-claim
negative I-claim
impacts I-claim
brought I-claim
about I-claim
by I-claim
mobile I-claim
phones I-claim
are I-claim
harmful I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
’s I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
character I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
highly O
discourage O
the O
young O
ones O
to O
be O
overly O
dependent O
on O
mobile O
phones O
. O

Leisure O
activities O
- O
Spend O
your O
free O
time O
outdoors O
or O
indoors O
. O

People O
often O
relax O
themselves O
by O
joining O
leisure O
activities O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
spend O
their O
free O
time O
indoors O
. O

But O
from O
my O
experience O
, O
I B-claim
myself I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
my I-claim
leisure I-claim
time I-claim
outdoors I-claim
because O
I O
strongly O
feel O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
health I-claim
and I-claim
keep I-claim
my I-claim
body I-claim
fit I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
outdoor B-claim
activities I-claim
enable I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
socialize I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
enjoy I-claim
natural I-claim
beauty I-claim
. O

There O
are O
strong O
advantages O
to O
spend O
leisure O
time O
outdoors O
. O

One O
benefit O
is O
that O
doing B-claim
outdoor I-claim
activities I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
soccer I-claim
and I-claim
baseball I-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
health I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
last B-premise
year I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
spent I-premise
my I-premise
summer I-premise
time I-premise
playing I-premise
soccer I-premise
and I-premise
baseball I-premise
. O

Playing B-premise
baseball I-premise
provided I-premise
my I-premise
upper I-premise
body I-premise
for I-premise
hitting I-premise
and I-premise
throwing I-premise
. O

Soccer B-premise
, I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
hand I-premise
, I-premise
developed I-premise
my I-premise
lower I-premise
body I-premise
for I-premise
kicking I-premise
and I-premise
endurance I-premise
for I-premise
playing I-premise
full I-premise
90-minute I-premise
- I-premise
games I-premise
. O

I O
belive O
that O
practicing B-premise
these I-premise
sports I-premise
helped I-premise
me I-premise
greatly I-premise
. O

Something O
else O
that O
is O
good O
is O
that O
playing B-premise
these I-premise
sports I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
my I-premise
body I-premise
fit I-premise
, I-premise
make I-premise
me I-premise
ultimately I-premise
refreshed I-premise
. O

After B-premise
that I-premise
summer I-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
body I-premise
is I-premise
stronger I-premise
and I-premise
endurance I-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
. O

Outdoor B-claim
activities I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
improves I-claim
my I-claim
health I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
gives I-claim
me I-claim
chances I-claim
to I-claim
communicate I-claim
with I-claim
more I-claim
people I-claim
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
ten I-premise
years I-premise
old I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
shy I-premise
girl I-premise
. O

My B-premise
mother I-premise
took I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
The I-premise
National I-premise
Camp I-premise
. O

At B-premise
first I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
just I-premise
ate I-premise
and I-premise
played I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

But B-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
third I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
swimming I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
friendly I-premise
girl I-premise
came I-premise
and I-premise
greeted I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
became I-premise
friend I-premise
later I-premise
and I-premise
she I-premise
taught I-premise
me I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
swim I-premise
effectively I-premise
. O

On B-premise
the I-premise
next I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
played I-premise
together I-premise
and I-premise
she I-premise
introduced I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
her I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
her I-premise
and I-premise
outdoor I-premise
activities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
going I-premise
skiing I-premise
, I-premise
climbing I-premise
the I-premise
mountain I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
friends I-premise
since I-premise
The I-premise
National I-premise
Camp I-premise
. O

If B-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
n't I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
camping I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
many I-premise
friends I-premise
like I-premise
today I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
you B-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
enjoy I-claim
the I-claim
beautiful I-claim
nature I-claim
when I-claim
doing I-claim
some I-claim
outdoor I-claim
activities I-claim
like I-claim
going I-claim
hiking I-claim
, I-claim
sunbathing I-claim
, I-claim
going I-claim
biking I-claim
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
spend I-premise
your I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
or I-premise
something I-premise
like I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
enjoy I-premise
beautiful I-premise
nature I-premise
. O

Spending B-claim
time I-claim
outdoors I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
breathe I-claim
fresh I-claim
air I-claim
, I-claim
feel I-claim
the I-claim
warm I-claim
sun I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
face I-claim
and I-claim
enjoy I-claim
the I-claim
complete I-claim
peace I-claim
that I-claim
only I-claim
nature I-claim
brings I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
indoor B-claim
activities I-claim
are I-claim
fun I-claim
. O

There B-premise
's I-premise
no I-premise
doubt I-premise
that I-premise
indoor I-premise
activities I-premise
like I-premise
reading I-premise
a I-premise
book I-premise
, I-premise
watching I-premise
TV I-premise
or I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
music I-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
us I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
joy I-premise
. O

Although O
I B-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
have I-claim
fun I-claim
in I-claim
indoor I-claim
activities I-claim
, O
this B-premise
advantage I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
outweigh I-premise
the I-premise
attractions I-premise
coming I-premise
from I-premise
outdoor I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
people O
are O
people O
and O
we O
have O
our O
own O
propensity O
. O

Leisure O
activities O
are O
one O
of O
them O

and O
I B-claim
myself I-claim
choose I-claim
outdoor I-claim
activities I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
my I-claim
leisure I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Cheap O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
encouraged O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
many O
airlines O
offer O
to O
their O
customers O
more O
and O
more O
number O
of O
cheap O
flights O
. O

People O
have O
various O
different O
views O
about O
cheap O
air O
travel O
. O

Although O
there O
are O
good O
arguments O
in O
favour O
of O
this O
trend O
should O
be O
encouraged O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
cheap B-claim
flight I-claim
can I-claim
make I-claim
many I-claim
serious I-claim
problem I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
cheap B-claim
air I-claim
fares I-claim
have I-claim
broadened I-claim
travel I-claim
possibilities I-claim
for I-claim
many I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
particularly I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
lower I-claim
income I-claim
group I-claim
. O

These B-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
millions I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
travel I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
for I-premise
work I-premise
or I-premise
pleasure I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
careers I-premise
, I-premise
broad I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
interact I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
varied I-premise
cultural I-premise
backgrounds I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
travels B-premise
also I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
the I-premise
tourist I-premise
industry I-premise
development I-premise
, I-premise
boost I-premise
the I-premise
economy I-premise
and I-premise
job I-premise
markets I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
growing B-claim
of I-claim
cheap I-claim
flights I-claim
really I-claim
have I-claim
negative I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Apparently O
, O
more B-premise
flights I-premise
could I-premise
mean I-premise
bigger I-premise
and I-premise
busier I-premise
airport I-premise
that I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
grown I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
close I-premise
to I-premise
it I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
biggest I-premise
concern I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise
. O

Burning B-premise
plane I-premise
fuel I-premise
can I-premise
releases I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxid I-premise
into I-premise
environment I-premise
that I-premise
cause I-premise
the I-premise
Earth I-premise
to I-premise
heat I-premise
up I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while B-premise
many I-premise
efforts I-premise
are I-premise
being I-premise
made I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
CO2 I-premise
emissions I-premise
from I-premise
cars I-premise
and I-premise
factories I-premise
, I-premise
nothing I-premise
is I-premise
being I-premise
done I-premise
to I-premise
reins I-premise
the I-premise
airlines I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
the B-claim
drawbacks I-claim
of I-claim
cheap I-claim
air I-claim
fares I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
more O
expensive O
. O

Instead O
, O
people O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
their O
responsibility O
to O
reduce O
the O
emissions O
caused O
by O
their O
lifestyle O
choices O
. O

Salary O
increases O
and O
promotions O
to O
new O
positions O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ways O

It O
is O
unquestionable O
that O
salary O
increases O
and O
promotions O
to O
new O
positions O
are O
very O
common O
way O
to O
reward O
employees O
for O
good O
work O
. O

Besides O
the O
methods O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
providing B-claim
professional I-claim
training I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
effective I-claim
in I-claim
encouraging I-claim
further I-claim
good I-claim
work I-claim
. O

My O
arguments O
for O
this O
point O
are O
listed O
follows O
. O

Firstly O
, O
training B-premise
time I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
employee I-premise
interesting I-premise
time I-premise
outside I-premise
working I-premise
office I-premise
to I-premise
refresh I-premise
their I-premise
mind I-premise
. O

Clearly O
, O
in B-premise
company I-premise
we I-premise
always I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
so I-premise
many I-premise
stressful I-premise
situations I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
negotiating I-premise
with I-premise
difficult I-premise
customer I-premise
, I-premise
complaining I-premise
from I-premise
boss I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we B-claim
can I-claim
unleash I-claim
uncomfortable I-claim
in I-claim
training I-claim
classes I-claim
by I-claim
making I-claim
new I-claim
friends I-claim
, I-claim
joking I-claim
in I-claim
class I-claim
, I-claim
enjoying I-claim
new I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
employees B-claim
fell I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
valuable I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
trained I-claim
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the B-premise
employees I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
their I-premise
company I-premise
is I-premise
investing I-premise
on I-premise
them I-premise
for I-premise
future I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
company I-premise
. O

So O
obviously O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
think I-premise
about I-premise
develop I-premise
long I-premise
term I-premise
career I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
company I-premise
. O

For O
another O
thing O
, O
employees B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
very I-premise
proud I-premise
of I-premise
themselves I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
provided I-premise
training I-premise
while I-premise
others I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
this I-premise
opportunity I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
providing B-claim
training I-claim
will I-claim
make I-claim
employees I-claim
happy I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
current I-claim
job I-claim
because O
it B-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
professional I-premise
business I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Having B-premise
professional I-premise
training I-premise
help I-premise
employees I-premise
gain I-premise
more I-premise
confidence I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
business I-premise
, O
so O
I O
believe O
that O
they B-premise
will I-premise
finish I-premise
their I-premise
jobs I-premise
with I-premise
excellent I-premise
result I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
, O
excellent B-premise
working I-premise
result I-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
very I-premise
happy I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
their I-premise
boss I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
providing B-claim
professional I-claim
training I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
reward I-claim
for I-claim
good I-claim
work I-claim
has I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

Training B-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
employees I-premise
refresh I-premise
their I-premise
mind I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
happy I-premise
, I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Taking O
into O
account O
of O
all O
these O
factors O
, O
we O
may O
reach O
the O
conclusion O
that O
training B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
effective I-claim
in I-claim
encouraging I-claim
further I-claim
good I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Attending O
university O
classes O
should O
be O
required O
or O
optional O
Attending O
university O
's O
classes O
is O
one O
of O
activities O
that O
students O
have O
to O
do O
. O

However O
, O
class O
is O
not O
the O
only O
source O
of O
knowledge O
. O

Students O
also O
learn O
from O
other O
sources O
such O
as O
experience O
, O
libraries O
and O
other O
people O
. O

I O
think O
going B-claim
to I-claim
classes I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
optional I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
for O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
reason O
why O
university O
students O
should O
not O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
class O
is O
sometimes B-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
better I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
sources I-claim
outside I-claim
the I-claim
class I-claim
room I-claim
. O

Student B-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
study I-premise
by I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
library I-premise
and I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
only I-premise
the I-premise
topic I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
understand I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
close I-premise
friend I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
department I-premise
with I-premise
me I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
. O

She B-premise
learned I-premise
quickly I-premise
and I-premise
understood I-premise
everything I-premise
in I-premise
class I-premise
so I-premise
fast I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
she B-premise
rarely I-premise
went I-premise
to I-premise
class I-premise
but I-premise
spent I-premise
most I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
confusing I-premise
topic I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
she B-premise
got I-premise
very I-premise
good I-premise
grade I-premise
when I-premise
she I-premise
was I-premise
graduation I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
students O
should O
not O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
because O
they B-claim
can I-claim
manage I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
spending I-claim
on I-claim
classes I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
other I-claim
benefit I-claim
things I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
already I-claim
understand I-claim
topic I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
class I-claim
very I-claim
well I-claim
. O

In O
my O
experience O
, O
many B-premise
times I-premise
I I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
attend I-premise
biology I-premise
class I-premise
because I-premise
my I-premise
university I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
require I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
I B-premise
had I-premise
already I-premise
studied I-premise
all I-premise
biology I-premise
topics I-premise
before I-premise
attending I-premise
university I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I B-premise
spent I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
of I-premise
biology I-premise
class I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
my I-premise
Chemistry I-premise
research I-premise
and I-premise
got I-premise
A+ I-premise
for I-premise
both I-premise
biology I-premise
and I-premise
chemistry I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
the B-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
know I-claim
what I-claim
activities I-claim
they I-claim
should I-claim
do I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
good I-claim
management I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
learning I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
they O
have O
to O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O

Computers O

The O
advent O

the O
computer O
is O
one O
of O
the O
results O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
advantaged O

While O
some O
people O
advocate O

the O
idea O
that O
computers O

more O
complex O

others O

the O
idea O

computers O
have O
made O
life O
easier O
and O
more O
convenient O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
computers B-claim
brought I-claim
convenience I-claim
and I-claim
easiness I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
life I-claim
since O
they B-claim
enabled I-claim
easier I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
information I-claim
and I-claim
increased I-claim
qualities I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

First O
, O
computers B-claim
through I-claim
internet I-claim
made I-claim
our I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
information I-claim
easier I-claim
. O

Through B-premise
computers I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
collect I-premise
appropriate I-premise
data I-premise
very I-premise
quickly I-premise
, I-premise
store I-premise
it I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
hard I-premise
disc I-premise
as I-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
we I-premise
want I-premise
and I-premise
use I-premise
it I-premise
when I-premise
needed I-premise
. O

Search B-premise
engines I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
google I-premise
, I-premise
yandex I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
features I-premise
relevant I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
characteristics I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
needed I-premise
enable I-premise
search I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
in I-premise
few I-premise
minutes I-premise
. O

Social B-premise
networks I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
facebook I-premise
, I-premise
twitter I-premise
have I-premise
changed I-premise
traditional I-premise
sources I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
and I-premise
decreasing I-premise
the I-premise
monopolization I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
governments I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
computers I-premise
we I-premise
spend I-premise
less I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
search I-premise
for I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
it I-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
sources I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
globalized I-premise
world I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
live I-premise
computers I-premise
made I-premise
communications I-premise
faster I-premise
, I-premise
visual I-premise
and I-premise
cheaper I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
email I-premise
our I-premise
messages I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
delivered I-premise
to I-premise
any I-premise
person I-premise
in I-premise
any I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
in I-premise
few I-premise
minutes I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
convenient I-premise
because O
you B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
mile I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
post I-premise
office I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
just I-premise
click I-premise
the I-premise
mouse I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise
computer I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
convenience I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise
arm I-premise
chair I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise

reach I-premise
your I-premise
friends I-premise

family I-premise
members I-premise
in I-premise
any I-premise
part I-premise

the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Internet B-premise
facilities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
msn I-premise
, I-premise
skype I-premise
made I-premise
visual I-premise
communication I-premise
possible I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
via B-premise
skype I-premise
people I-premise
not I-premise
just I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
members I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
make I-premise
interviews I-premise
for I-premise
employment I-premise
, I-premise
enrolment I-premise
into I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

In O
result O
, O
communication B-claim
has I-claim
become I-claim
cheaper I-claim
, I-claim
faster I-claim
and I-claim
visual I-claim
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
computers B-claim
have I-claim
made I-claim
life I-claim
easier I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
convenient I-claim
in O
the O
ways O
that O
it B-claim
broadened I-claim
the I-claim
sources I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
and I-claim
made I-claim
access I-claim
more I-claim
quick I-claim
, I-claim
a I-claim
long I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
improving I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
communication I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

Computers O
have O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
office O
workers O
to O
do O
their O
work O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
working O
at O
home O
brings O
to O
workers O
and O
employees O
too O
much O
convenience O
, O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
. O

Because O
the O
best O
conditions O
are O
sometimes O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
good O
as O
the O
expectation O
of O
people O
. O

Working O
without O
pressure O
and O
interaction O
are O
some O
examples O
for O
these O
disadvantages O
. O

Pressure B-premise
is I-premise
motivation I-premise
. O

Each B-premise
office I-premise
has I-premise
its I-premise
rules I-premise
that I-premise
keep I-premise
workers I-premise
do I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
as I-premise
effectively I-premise
as I-premise
possible I-premise
. O

The B-premise
directors I-premise
manage I-premise
employers I-premise
and I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
the I-premise
deadline I-premise
of I-premise
projects I-premise
. O

Then B-premise
again I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
workers I-premise
must I-premise
try I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
limit I-premise
. O

Doing B-claim
all I-claim
jobs I-claim
at I-claim

do I-claim
n't I-claim
make I-claim
employees I-claim
attempt I-claim

work I-claim
like I-claim
this I-claim
. O

Computers B-claim
and I-claim
modems I-claim
bring I-claim
works I-claim
to I-claim
home I-claim
but I-claim
these I-claim
still I-claim

many I-claim
things I-claim
distract I-claim

Facebook B-premise

been I-premise
the I-premise
entertaining I-premise

however I-premise

the I-premise
reasons I-premise
why I-premise

their I-premise

The B-premise
dos I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
at I-premise
office I-premise
play I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
these I-premise
things I-premise
from I-premise
workers I-premise
. O

In O
condition O
, O
doing B-premise
all I-premise
jobs I-premise
alone I-premise
makes I-premise
employees I-premise
fall I-premise
asleep I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the B-premise
project I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
being I-premise
done I-premise
. O

The B-premise
best I-premise
condition I-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
good I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
. O

Interaction B-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
an I-claim
advantage I-claim
for I-claim
workers I-claim
at I-claim
offices I-claim
. O

Discussing B-premise
and I-premise
debating I-premise
Projects I-premise
together I-premise
increase I-premise
working I-premise
ability I-premise
because O
all B-premise
we I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
target I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
reached I-premise
fast I-premise
thanks I-premise
to I-premise
working I-premise

Besides O

interaction B-premise
help I-premise
employees I-premise

their I-premise
communicational I-premise

therefore O

they B-premise

have I-premise
more I-premise

more I-premise

Interaction B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
factor I-premise
increasing I-premise
working I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

There B-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
many I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
if I-claim
the I-claim
workers I-claim
work I-claim
at I-claim

Mitigating B-claim
process I-claim
, I-claim
no I-claim
interaction I-claim
and I-claim
pressure I-claim
are I-claim
these I-claim
things I-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
examine I-claim

On O
one O

the B-claim
development I-claim

export I-premise

With B-premise
the I-premise

this O

we B-premise

On O
the O
other O

the B-claim
development I-claim

likely I-claim
to I-claim
bring I-claim
some I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim

People B-premise

This B-premise

pose I-premise

large I-premise
threat I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
ecology I-premise

Vehicle B-premise
technology I-premise

to I-premise
drive I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise

emission I-premise

In O
conclusion O

although O
technological B-claim
progress I-claim

problems I-claim

it B-claim
still I-claim
provides I-claim
us I-claim

much I-claim
more I-claim

. O

A O
greater O
proportion O

the O
budget O

be O
allotted O

issues O

In O
today O

world O

the O
concept O
of O
the O

requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O

education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
devote I-claim
a I-claim
greater I-claim
portion I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
budgets I-claim
to I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
means I-claim
for I-claim
precautions I-claim
. O

The O
first O
reason O
why O
education O
and O
preventative O
measures O
should O
receive O
a O
greater O
budget O
is O
the O
potential O
improvements O
in O
health O
system O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing B-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise
system I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
hospitals I-premise

healthcare I-premise

managed I-premise
effectively I-premise
which I-premise

result I-premise
in I-premise
better I-premise
treatments I-premise

Therefore O
, O
society B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
educated I-claim

aware I-claim

so O
that O
the B-premise
potential I-premise
precautions I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise

illnesses I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
taken I-premise
instead I-premise

trying I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
treatment I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
increasing I-premise
number I-premise

patients I-premise
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments O
should O
allocate O
more O
budget O
on O
prevention O
from O
illness O
and O
providing O
health O
education O
is O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
society O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
nothing I-premise
more I-premise
important I-premise
than I-premise
health I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
happiness I-premise

welfare I-premise
come I-premise
with I-premise
health I-premise

Therefore O
, O
a B-claim
government I-claim
's I-claim
role I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
providing I-claim
means I-claim
that I-claim
lead I-claim
its I-claim
citizens I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
prevent I-claim
from I-claim
potential I-claim
illness I-claim
that I-claim
can I-claim
cause I-claim
misery I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim

For O
example O

the B-premise
marketing I-premise
campaign I-premise

Ministry I-premise

in I-premise
Turkey I-premise

smoking I-premise

a I-premise
better I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
campaign I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
greater I-claim
proportion I-claim

the I-claim
budget I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
allotted I-claim

I O

zoos B-claim
provide I-claim
social I-claim

When B-premise

In B-premise

The B-claim

spending I-claim
time I-claim

a B-claim

Someone B-premise
take I-premise

Most O

all O

a B-premise

For O
the O

if B-claim

chance I-claim

visit I-claim
top I-claim
museums I-claim

During O

it B-claim

Study O

I B-claim
do I-claim

think I-claim
that I-claim

replace I-claim

Here O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

Studying B-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
by I-claim
using I-claim
technology I-claim
is I-claim
convenient I-claim
. O

The B-premise
biggest I-premise
advantage I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
your I-premise
classroom I-premise
and I-premise
instructor I-premise
are I-premise
available I-premise
24 I-premise
hours I-premise
a I-premise
day I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you B-premise
could I-premise
make I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise

completing I-premise
the I-premise
requirements I-premise

the I-premise

You B-premise

any I-premise

However O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise

extremely I-premise
dedicated I-premise

have I-premise
good I-premise
time I-premise
management I-premise
skills I-premise

it I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
very I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
complete I-premise
a I-premise

at I-premise
home I-premise
. O

First O
, O
attending B-premise
an I-premise
education I-premise
course I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
requires I-premise
persistence I-premise
and I-premise
patience I-premise
. O

Especially O
when B-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
instructor I-premise
there I-premise
to I-premise
guide I-premise
you I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise

up I-premise

all I-premise

Students B-claim
may I-claim

they I-claim

problems I-claim

understanding I-claim
some I-claim
specific I-claim
topics I-claim

subjects I-claim

Unfortunately O
, O
it B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
predicament I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
face I-premise
some I-premise
problems I-premise
in I-premise
learning I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
help I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
studying B-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
traditional I-premise
learning I-premise
. O

Unlike B-premise
traditional I-premise
classes I-premise
, I-premise
distance I-premise
education I-premise
courses I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
take I-premise
place I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
classroom I-premise
, I-premise
where I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
surrounded I-premise
by I-premise
your I-premise
teachers I-premise
and I-premise
classmates I-premise
. O

Students B-claim
may I-claim
find I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
hard I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
without I-claim
being I-claim
kept I-claim
under I-claim
supervision I-claim
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
type I-premise
that I-premise
gets I-premise
easily I-premise
distracted I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
distance I-premise
- I-premise
learning I-premise
program I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
for I-premise
you I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there B-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
traditional I-claim
school I-claim
- I-claim
socialization- I-claim
establishes I-claim
relationship I-claim
with I-claim
classmates I-claim
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
from I-premise
programs I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
; O
however O
, O
our B-premise
computers I-premise
or I-premise
televisions I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
teach I-premise
us I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
along I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
may I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
cooperate I-premise
with I-premise
classmates I-premise
from I-premise
teamwork I-premise
. O

Studying B-premise
alone I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
might I-premise
deprive I-premise
us I-premise

these I-premise
significant I-premise
and I-premise
valuable I-premise
opportunities I-premise
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O

I O
agree O
that O
distance B-claim
education I-claim
ca I-claim
n't I-claim
replace I-claim
traditional I-claim
school I-claim

I O
believe O
it O
is O
a O
good O

I O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
idea I-claim

a I-claim
large I-claim

in I-claim
our I-claim
community I-claim
. O

The O
following O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the B-premise
establishment I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
shopping I-premise
center I-premise
will I-premise
provide I-premise
the I-premise
residents I-premise
a I-premise
more I-premise
convenient I-premise
place I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
shopping I-premise
. O

Here O
is O
a O
positive O
example O
: O
Queens B-premise
Center I-premise
Mall I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
shopping I-premise
mall I-premise
located I-premise
in I-premise
Queens I-premise
borough I-premise
of I-premise
New I-premise
York I-premise
City I-premise
, I-premise
provides I-premise
a I-premise
wide I-premise
vairtey I-premise
of I-premise
stores I-premise
, I-premise
products I-premise
and I-premise
services I-premise
, I-premise
from I-premise
clothing I-premise
to I-premise
electronics I-premise
and I-premise
restaurants I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
consumers I-premise
can I-premise
choose I-premise
. O

It O
is O
widely O
thought O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
productive I-premise
malls I-premise
in I-premise
New I-premise
York I-premise
. O

I O
found O
that O
I B-premise
could I-premise
find I-premise
virtually I-premise
every I-premise
brand I-premise
or I-premise
store I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
Macy I-premise
's I-premise
and I-premise
JCPenney I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
visited I-premise
there I-premise
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
a B-claim
large I-claim
shopping I-claim
mall I-claim
provides I-claim
a I-claim
location I-claim
for I-claim
residents I-claim
to I-claim
pursue I-claim
during I-claim
their I-claim
leisure I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
provides I-claim
a I-claim
place I-claim
to I-claim
shop I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
offer I-claim
people I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

There B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
vacancies I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
need I-premise
of I-premise
opening I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
stores I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
shopping I-premise
mall I-premise
. O

It B-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
an I-premise
opportunity I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
looking I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
full I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
retirees I-premise
may I-premise
work I-premise
there I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
whiling I-premise
away I-premise
their I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
earning I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
likely I-claim
for I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
buy I-claim
goods I-claim
in I-claim
lower I-claim
price I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
shopping I-claim
center I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
save I-claim
our I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
hand I-claim
. O

There B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
competition I-premise
between I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
shopping I-premise
center I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
existing I-premise
stores I-premise
to I-premise
attract I-premise
the I-premise
customers I-premise
. O

Accordingly O
, O
with B-premise
sales I-premise
promotion I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise
for I-premise
consumers I-premise
to I-premise
compare I-premise
the I-premise
price I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
merchandise I-premise
before I-premise
they I-premise
buy I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
residents I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
spending I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
commute I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
hope I-premise
of I-premise
setting I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
shopping I-premise
center I-premise
near I-premise
their I-premise
homes I-premise
. O

For O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
, O
I B-claim
advocate I-claim
building I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
shopping I-claim
center I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
neighborhood I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
community I-claim
. O

What O
is O
a O
very O
important O
skill O
a O
person O
should O
learn O
Some O
people O
think O
that O
life O
is O
a O
struggle O
, O
which O
means O
we O
may O
encounter O
numerous O
difficulties O
during O
our O
lives O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
stress B-claim
management I-claim
, I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
survive I-claim
our I-claim
unbearable I-claim
stress I-claim
, I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
skill I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
. O

Here O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

Stress B-premise
, I-premise
our I-premise
body I-premise
's I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
responding I-premise
to I-premise
any I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
demand I-premise
, I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
both I-premise
good I-premise
and I-premise
bad I-premise
experiences I-premise
. O

Stress B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
positive I-premise
mobilization I-premise
to I-premise
drive I-premise
for I-premise
success I-premise
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
widely I-premise
thought I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
experience I-premise
stress I-premise
any I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
comes I-premise
across I-premise
unexpectedly I-premise
that I-premise
frustrates I-premise
our I-premise
goals I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
if B-claim
we I-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
stress I-claim
management I-claim
skill I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
may I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
critical I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
frenetic I-premise
, I-premise
fast I-premise
- I-premise
paced I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
common I-premise
predicament I-premise
that I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
us I-premise
, I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
senior I-premise
, I-premise
feel I-premise
depressed I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
stress I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
financial I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
exam I-premise
stress I-premise
, I-premise
relationship I-premise
difficulties I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
overload I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
people I-premise
regard I-premise
stress I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
power I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
overcomes I-premise
the I-premise
obstacles I-premise
to I-premise
motivate I-premise
themselves I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
; O
other B-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
charge I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
thoughts I-premise
, I-premise
emotions I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
they I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
stress B-claim
management I-claim
recently I-claim
becomes I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
significant I-claim
issue I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
realization I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
stress B-premise
takes I-premise
a I-premise
toll I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
health I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
known I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
modern I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
frequently I-premise
full I-premise
of I-premise
hassles I-premise
, I-premise
frustrations I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
demands I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
reasons I-premise
why I-premise
people I-premise
were I-premise
overwhelmed I-premise
by I-premise
constant I-premise
stress I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
physical I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
insomnia I-premise
and I-premise
headaches I-premise
. O

Melancholia B-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
fatal I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
leads I-premise
some I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
commit I-premise
suicide I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
reduce I-claim
and I-claim
cope I-claim
with I-claim
our I-claim
stress I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
goal I-claim
of I-claim
balancing I-claim
our I-claim
mind I-claim
and I-claim
body I-claim
. O

To O
avoid O
being O
a O
pessimist O
, O
we O
may O
try O
to O
conquer O
our O
distress O
by O
sharing O
our O
worry O
with O
friends O

families O
, O
doing O
exercise O
regularly O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
see O
our O
troubles O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
stress B-claim
management I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
essential I-claim
skill I-claim
for I-claim
everyone I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
and I-claim
find I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
their I-claim
stress I-claim
. O

Establishing O
a O
new O
university O
in O
your O
community O
I B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
happy I-claim
to I-claim
hear I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim

a I-claim
plan I-claim

a I-claim
new I-claim

There B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
setting I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
more I-claim

pursue I-claim
their I-claim

creation I-claim

. O

However O
, O
they O
come O
together O
with O
some O
disadvantages O
such O

social O
problems O

This B-claim
new I-claim
university I-claim

allow I-claim

For O

He B-premise

she I-premise
definitely I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise

the I-premise
business I-premise

in I-premise
the I-premise
proposed I-premise
community I-premise

university I-premise

Undoubtedly O
, O
the B-premise
university I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
hire I-premise
professors I-premise

employees I-premise
and I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
a B-premise
number I-premise
vacant I-premise
positions I-premise
need I-premise

be I-premise
filled I-premise
. O

Also O
there B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
opportunities I-premise

work I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise

Moreover O
, O
when B-premise
people I-premise

they I-premise

have I-premise
money I-premise

. O

This B-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
help I-claim
stimulate I-claim
the I-claim
local I-claim
economy I-claim
. O

However O
, O
building B-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
may I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
social I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

A B-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
then I-premise
may I-premise
come I-premise
from I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
communities I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
in I-premise
to I-premise
or I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
jobs I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
. O

When B-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
congregate I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
some I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
social I-premise
problems I-premise
will I-premise
follow I-premise
. O

Traffic B-premise
may I-premise
worsen I-premise
. O

More B-premise

have I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
managed I-premise
. O

Maybe B-premise
crime I-premise

also I-premise
increase I-premise

These B-premise
social I-premise
problems I-premise
may I-premise
impair I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise

life I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise

In O
sum O
, O
I B-claim
myself I-claim
agree I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
plan I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
the I-claim

. O

I O
believe O
the B-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
it I-claim

outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
cost I-claim

However O
, O
it O
would O
be O

Television O
versus O
Friends O

We O
all O
know O
that O
television O
provides O
us O
many O
benefits O
; O
it O
helps O
people O
relax O
, O
helps O
keep O
up O
with O
news O
, O
helps O
broad O
our O
mind O
. O

However O
, O
have O
you O
ever O
thought O
that O
television O
has O
destroyed O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
family O
? O

I B-claim
personally I-claim
consider I-claim
this I-claim
fact I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
harmful I-claim
thing I-claim
that I-claim
television I-claim
has I-claim
brought I-claim
upon I-claim
us I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
since O
people B-premise
watch I-premise
television I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
, O
they B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
isolated I-claim
from I-claim
others I-claim
. O

Children B-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
pay I-premise
more I-premise
attention I-premise
on I-premise
movies I-premise
, I-premise
music I-premise
show I-premise
provided I-premise
by I-premise
television I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
anything I-premise
else I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
school I-premise
or I-premise
practicing I-premise
exercise I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
taken I-premise
apart I-premise
by I-premise
others I-premise
. O

Gradually B-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
leave I-premise
them I-premise
behind I-premise
either I-premise
activities I-premise
or I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
rapid I-premise
change I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
standard I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
each I-premise
family I-premise
has I-premise
three I-premise
or I-premise
four I-premise
TV I-premise
in I-premise
each I-premise
room I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
common I-premise
. O

Parents B-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
children I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
watching I-premise
TV I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
room I-premise
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
children B-claim
will I-claim
learn I-claim
behavior I-claim
from I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
see I-claim
on I-claim
TV I-claim
not I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
function I-premise
their I-premise
parental I-premise
care I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
necessary I-premise
thing I-premise
to I-premise
children I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
communication B-claim
between I-claim
family I-claim
members I-claim
is I-claim
visibly I-claim
destroyed I-claim
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
watching B-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
television I-claim
people I-claim
will I-claim
unconsciously I-claim
learn I-claim
bad I-claim
behavior I-claim
that I-claim
sow I-claim
division I-claim
among I-claim
human I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
watching B-premise
film I-premise
about I-premise
terrorist I-premise
children I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
terrorism I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
right I-premise
thing I-premise
. O

What O
happens O
if O
they O
do O
act O

exactly O
the O
terrorist O
in O
Hollywood O
movies O
does O
? O
is O
this O
one O
of O
the O
reason O
cause O
division O
in O
society O
? O

In O
conclusion O
, O
though O
television B-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
good I-claim
sides I-claim
, O
it B-claim
has I-claim
destroyed I-claim
communication I-claim
among I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
family I-claim
. O

We O
need O
to O
quickly O
find O
the O
way O
to O
address O
this O
problem O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
and O
the O
first O
concern O
is O
to O
reducing O
violent O
behaviors O
that O

Everybody B-premise

the I-premise

Although O
renewable O

are O
elements O
of O
the O
current O

future O

strategy O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O

concerned O
, O
these O
new B-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim

can I-claim
not I-claim

fossil I-claim

such I-claim
as I-claim
gases I-claim
, I-claim
oil I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
coal I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
due B-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
limitation I-claim
of I-claim
technology I-claim
renewable I-claim
resources I-claim
are I-claim
relatively I-claim
expensive I-claim
. O

Researches B-premise
in I-premise
renewable I-premise
energy I-premise
cost I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
which I-premise
developing I-premise
countries I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
fossil B-premise
fuels I-premise
are I-premise
abundant I-premise
and I-premise
inexpensive I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
estimated I-premise
that I-premise
China I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
largest I-premise
deposit I-premise
of I-premise
coal I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
invest I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
new I-premise
forms I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
, I-premise
say I-premise
expensive I-premise
solar I-premise
batteries I-premise
and I-premise
wind I-premise
farms I-premise
. O

Thus O
the B-premise
plan I-premise
of I-premise
renewable I-premise
resources I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
may I-premise
face I-premise
challenges I-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
not I-premise
every I-premise
country I-premise
can I-premise
afford I-premise
the I-premise
reforming I-premise

Besides O
, O
although O
utility B-premise
companies I-premise
claim I-premise
that I-premise
renewable I-premise
energy I-premise
is I-premise
environmentally I-premise
friendly I-premise
; O
these B-claim
new I-claim
forms I-claim
of I-claim

may I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
as I-claim
clean I-claim
and I-claim

as I-claim
we I-claim

. O

Latest B-premise
studies I-premise
have I-premise
shown I-premise
that I-premise
these I-premise
renewable I-premise
resources I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
are I-premise
problematic I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
pose I-premise
long I-premise
- I-premise
term I-premise
environmental I-premise
hazards I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
dams I-premise
built I-premise
for I-premise
hydroelectricity I-premise
influence I-premise
the I-premise
water I-premise
flows I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
rivers I-premise
and I-premise
sometimes I-premise
cause I-premise
drought I-premise
in I-premise
areas I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
dams I-premise
. O

This B-premise
damages I-premise
the I-premise
habitats I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
valuable I-premise
fish I-premise
and I-premise
wading I-premise
birds I-premise
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the B-premise
accumulation I-premise
of I-premise
heavy I-premise
metal I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
silt I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
bottom I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
rivers I-premise
behind I-premise
the I-premise

is I-premise
extremely I-premise
difficult I-premise
and I-premise
expensive I-premise
to I-premise
clean I-premise
up I-premise
; I-premise
leaving I-premise
problems I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
following I-premise
generations I-premise
. O

Thus O
renewable B-premise
resources I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
as I-premise
reliable I-premise
as I-premise
we I-premise
think I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
contemporarily B-claim
fossil I-claim
fuels I-claim
cause I-claim
serious I-claim
environmental I-claim
conundrums I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
acid I-claim
rain I-claim
, I-claim
deduction I-claim
of I-claim
ozone I-claim
layer I-claim
and I-claim
global I-claim
warming I-claim
; O
these B-premise
problems I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
solved I-premise
by I-premise
improving I-premise
efficiency I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
mechanism I-premise
and I-premise
reducing I-premise
emissions I-premise
. O

For O
example O
we B-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
chemicals I-premise
to I-premise
desulfurize I-premise
the I-premise
emissions I-premise
from I-premise
plants I-premise
and I-premise
vehicles I-premise
to I-premise
avoid I-premise
acid I-premise
rain I-premise
. O

These B-premise
improving I-premise
methods I-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
cheaper I-premise
and I-premise
simpler I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
tech I-premise
of I-premise
renewable I-premise
energy I-premise
. O

With B-premise
these I-premise
solutions I-premise
fossil I-premise
fuels I-premise
seem I-premise
more I-premise
sustainable I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
as O
promising O
as O
renewable O

of O

sound O
, O
there B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
way I-claim

the I-premise
unemployment I-premise
rate I-premise
and I-premise
crime I-premise
rate I-premise
. O

Thus O
the B-claim
needs I-claim
for I-claim
farmland I-claim
, I-claim
housing I-claim
and I-claim
industry I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
farmland B-claim
, I-claim
housing I-claim
and I-claim
industry I-claim
can I-claim
satisfy I-claim
the I-claim
desire I-claim
of I-claim
human I-claim
that I-claim
living I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
life I-claim
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
understood O
that O
farming B-premise
, I-premise
housing I-premise
and I-premise
industry I-premise
provide I-premise
us I-premise
the I-premise
food I-premise
we I-premise
eat I-premise
, I-premise
place I-premise
we I-premise
live I-premise
, I-premise
clothes I-premise
we I-premise
wear I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
essential I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
. O

Especially B-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
poor I-premise
areas I-premise
, I-premise
survival I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
significant I-premise
thing I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
highly B-premise
developed I-premise
agriculture I-premise
and I-premise
industry I-premise
can I-premise
improve I-premise
our I-premise
living I-premise
conditions I-premise
which I-premise
allow I-premise
us I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
quality I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Last O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
is O
that O
even O
though O
farmland B-premise
, I-premise
housing I-premise
and I-premise
industry I-premise
will I-premise
occupy I-premise
the I-premise
land I-premise
used I-premise
for I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
, O
it B-claim
can I-claim
do I-claim
good I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
the I-claim
endangered I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

According O
to O
the O
discuss O
above O
, O
agriculture B-premise
and I-premise
industry I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
contribution I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economy I-premise
. O

With O
the O
economy O
development O
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
advanced I-premise
methods I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

For O
instant O
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
invent I-premise
new I-premise
technique I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
to I-premise
produce I-premise
offspring I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
sure I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
distinct I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
protecting B-claim
endangered I-claim
animals I-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
, O
nevertheless O
, O
human B-claim
needs I-claim
for I-claim
farmland I-claim
, I-claim
housing I-claim
and I-claim
industry I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
. O

Physical O
exercise O
should O
be O
required O
part O
of O
every O
school O
day O

Although O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
students O
should O
spend O
the O
whole O
day O
on O
academic O
studies O
, O
I O
nevertheless O
believe O
that O
physical B-claim
exercise I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
crucial I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
every I-claim
school I-claim
day I-claim
. O

Exercise B-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
for I-claim
having I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
health I-claim
body I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
mind I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
including B-claim
exercise I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
daily I-claim
routine I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
teach I-claim
them I-claim
the I-claim
importance I-claim
of I-claim
physical I-claim
activity I-claim
from I-claim
an I-claim
early I-claim
age I-claim
. O

Physical B-claim
activity I-claim
helps I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
grow I-claim
up I-claim
physically I-claim
healthier I-claim
. O

As O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
the B-premise
rate I-premise
of I-premise
obesity I-premise
in I-premise
children I-premise
has I-premise
increased I-premise
every I-premise
year I-premise

it I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
very I-premise
beneficial I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise

have I-premise
a I-premise
daily I-premise
physical I-premise

get I-premise
a I-premise
break I-premise
from I-premise
being I-premise
sitting I-premise
several I-premise
hours I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
exercise B-premise
will I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
less I-premise
exposed I-premise
to I-premise
illness I-premise
related I-premise
with I-premise
cardiovascular I-premise

higher I-premise

Daily B-claim
exercise I-claim

develop I-claim
children I-claim

It B-premise

well I-premise
known I-premise
how I-premise
important I-premise
it I-premise

exercise I-premise
regularly I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
the I-premise
body I-premise

work I-premise
better I-premise

When B-premise
people I-premise
exercise I-premise

the I-premise
respiratory I-premise
system I-premise

is I-premise
enhanced I-premise

helping I-premise
all I-premise
organs I-premise

including I-premise
the I-premise
brain I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
oxygen I-premise
in I-premise

Daily B-premise
exercise I-premise
will I-premise
provide I-premise
children I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
mental I-premise
break I-premise
which I-premise
will I-premise
boost I-premise
them I-premise

be I-premise
efficient I-premise
learners I-premise
. O

Having B-claim
children I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
daily I-claim
exercise I-claim
routine I-claim
from I-claim
an I-claim
early I-claim
age I-claim
will I-claim
teach I-claim
them I-claim
the I-claim
important I-claim
value I-claim
of I-claim
having I-claim
physical I-claim
activity I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
every I-claim
day I-claim
routine I-claim
. O

Children B-premise
are I-premise
bombarded I-premise
with I-premise
lectures I-premise
about I-premise
nutrition I-premise
and I-premise
physical I-premise
activity I-premise
; I-premise
however I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise

more I-premise
beneficed I-premise
if I-premise
that I-premise
knowledge I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
put I-premise

. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
stick I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
routine I-premise

make I-premise
the I-premise
daily I-premise
physical I-premise
activities I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
habit I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
whole I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Including B-claim
physical I-claim
activity I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
school I-claim
day I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
strongly I-claim
considered I-claim
. O

It B-claim
will I-claim
meliorate I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
mental I-claim
and I-claim
body I-claim
health I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
will I-claim
establish I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
a I-claim
habit I-claim
of I-claim
doing I-claim
it I-claim
, I-claim
giving I-claim
them I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
measure I-claim
the I-claim
worth I-claim
of I-claim
including I-claim
such I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
activity I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
daily I-claim
live I-claim
schedules I-claim
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
good O
for O
teenagers O
to O
work O
while O
schooling O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
good I-claim
idea I-claim
for I-claim
teenagers I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
job I-claim
while I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
still I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Although O
, O
many B-claim
argue I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
provide I-claim
good I-claim
working I-claim
experience I-claim
, O
but O
I O
think O
it B-claim
can I-claim
interfere I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
various I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

Having B-claim
jobs I-claim
would I-claim
affect I-claim
the I-claim
health I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
student I-claim
. O

It B-claim
divert I-claim
their I-claim
mind I-claim
from I-claim
studies I-claim
and I-claim
would I-claim
take I-claim
away I-claim
their I-claim
childhood I-claim
phase I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
. O

A B-premise
student I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
studies I-premise
in I-premise
today I-premise
's I-premise
competitive I-premise
world I-premise
to I-premise
prove I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

He B-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
his I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
grades I-premise
. O

If B-claim
the I-claim
student I-claim
get I-claim
involved I-claim
himself I-claim
in I-claim
job I-claim
in I-claim
rest I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
then I-claim
it I-claim
would I-claim
cause I-claim
an I-claim
extra I-claim
burden I-claim
on I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
jobs B-premise
has I-premise
various I-premise
responsibilities I-premise
like I-premise
attendance I-premise
, I-premise
sometimes I-premise
extra I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
. O

This B-premise
would I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
stress I-premise
, I-premise
tension I-premise
and I-premise
tiredness I-premise
. O

They B-premise
wo I-premise
n't I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
proper I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
relaxation I-premise
, I-premise
sleep I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
would B-claim
affect I-claim
their I-claim
mental I-claim
and I-claim
physical I-claim
health I-claim
. O

Another O
reason O
, O
jobs B-claim
can I-claim
divert I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
studies I-claim
. O

If B-premise
students I-premise
started I-premise
earning I-premise
in I-premise
earlier I-premise
age I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
attracted I-premise
towards I-premise
money I-premise
. O

They B-premise
feel I-premise
themselves I-premise
independent I-premise
and I-premise
would I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
more I-premise
for I-premise
money I-premise
. O

This B-premise
would I-premise
affect I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
loose I-premise
their I-premise
interest I-premise
from I-premise
studies I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-premise
drop I-premise
out I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
so I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
earn I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
the B-premise
main I-premise
drawback I-premise
of I-premise
teenagers I-premise
job I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
miss I-premise
out I-premise
the I-premise
fun I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
childhood I-premise
time I-premise
. O

He B-premise
would I-premise
miss I-premise
various I-premise
childhood I-premise
activities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
hang I-premise
out I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
clubs I-premise
and I-premise
fun I-premise
activities I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
interaction I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
whole I-premise
life I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
job I-premise
and I-premise
prove I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
the I-premise
childhood I-premise
phase I-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
return I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
as I-claim
much I-claim
possible I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
for B-claim
a I-claim
teenager I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
pay I-claim
attention I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
studies I-claim
. O

Having B-claim
job I-claim
would I-claim
affect I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
, I-claim
divert I-claim
them I-claim
from I-claim
studies I-claim
and I-claim
take I-claim
away I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
important I-claim
phase I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Do O
zoos O
serve O
any O
useful O
function O
? O

It O
has O
become O
quite O
a O
common O
hobby O
of O
children O
that O
they O
usually O
spend O
their O
free O
time O
in O
zoos O
. O

Zoos O
have O
been O
established O
for O
ages O
all O
over O
the O
world O
and O
have O
become O
interesting O
places O
for O
entertainment O
. O

Over O
the O
time O
, O
there O
are O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
arguments O
concerning O
whether O
zoos O
are O
helpful O
in O
serving O
people O
or O
they O
are O
just O
some O
kinds O
of O
bad O
treatments O
to O
animals O
. O

Some O
people O
spot O
out O
that O
humanities B-claim
benefit I-claim
so I-claim
much I-claim
from I-claim
zoos I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
zoos B-premise
are I-premise
fascinating I-premise
places I-premise
of I-premise
entertainment I-premise
. O

For O
this O
point O
, O
they O
all O
think O
that O
the B-premise
very I-premise
nature I-premise
and I-premise
wildness I-premise
are I-premise
all I-premise
brought I-premise
into I-premise
zoos I-premise
and I-premise
spending I-premise
time I-premise
there I-premise
help I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
forget I-premise
all I-premise
stress I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
pressure I-premise
. O

Another O
function O
that O
all B-premise
zoos I-premise
serve I-premise
relates I-premise
to I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
students I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
people I-premise
find I-premise
zoos I-premise
as I-premise
good I-premise
places I-premise
for I-premise
witnessing I-premise
and I-premise
researching I-premise
the I-premise
true I-premise
animal I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
some B-premise
zoos I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
reservation I-premise
sites I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
animals I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
about I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
extinct I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
, O
however O
, O
people O
who O
think O
that O
zoos B-claim
just I-claim
take I-claim
away I-claim
freedom I-claim
of I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

Being B-premise
confined I-premise
, I-premise
animals I-premise
may I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
nature I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
wildness I-premise
and I-premise
feel I-premise
upset I-premise
and I-premise
discontented I-premise
. O

In O
their O
opinion O
, O
zoos B-premise
are I-premise
some I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
prisons I-premise

and I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
so I-premise
cruel I-premise
and I-premise
wrong I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
animal I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
prisons I-premise
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
first O
group O
. O

In B-claim
modern I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
zoos I-claim
have I-claim
become I-claim
even I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
in I-claim
serving I-claim
as I-claim
places I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
and I-claim
enjoy I-claim
the I-claim
nature I-claim
while I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
natural I-claim
destruction I-claim
is I-claim
made I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
towers I-claim
and I-claim
skyscrapers I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
recently B-claim
, I-claim
zookeepers I-claim
have I-claim
also I-claim
tried I-claim
their I-claim
best I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
animals I-claim
feel I-claim
more I-claim
comfortable I-claim
by I-claim
making I-claim
artificial I-claim
landscapes I-claim
more I-claim
familiar I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
nature I-claim
, I-claim
taking I-claim
care I-claim
all I-claim
animals I-claim
in I-claim
both I-claim
feeding I-claim
and I-claim
sanity I-claim
. O

Studying O
alone O
or O
in O
a O
group O

When O
I O
found O
the O
chance O
of O
studying O
in O
a O
group O
with O
my O
classmates O
, O
I O
wished O
I O
can O
go O
back O
in O
time O
and O
took O
all O
my O
exams O
again O
. O

I B-claim
personally I-claim
prefer I-claim
studying I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
group I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
these I-claim
noticeable I-claim
features I-claim
, I-claim
getting I-claim
help I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
students I-claim
, I-claim
improving I-claim
my I-claim
attitude I-claim
for I-claim
learning I-claim
, I-claim
managing I-claim
my I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
effective I-claim
way I-claim
. O

When B-claim
pupils I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
group I-claim
for I-claim
studying I-claim
, I-claim
all I-claim
member I-claim
of I-claim
group I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
together I-premise
for I-premise
understanding I-premise
the I-premise
complicated I-premise
aspect I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
course I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
faces I-premise
with I-premise
complex I-premise
math I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
share I-premise
their I-premise
opinions I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
it I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
such B-premise
a I-premise
remarkable I-premise
effect I-premise
has I-premise
incorporation I-premise
that I-premise
all I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
weak I-premise
points I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
. O

Increasing B-claim
the I-claim
motivation I-claim
and I-claim
competence I-claim
spirit I-claim
are I-claim
another I-claim
benefit I-claim
of I-claim
group I-claim
- I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

In B-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
student I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
of I-premise
those I-premise
always I-premise
encourages I-premise
others I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
harder I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
pupils B-premise
often I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
tangible I-premise
competence I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
highest I-premise
grade I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
. O

Clearly O
, O
better B-premise
learning I-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
noticeable I-premise
result I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
competences I-premise
and I-premise
encouragements I-premise
. O

When B-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
study I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
schedule I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
effective I-premise
manner I-premise
. O

Group B-premise
- I-premise
studying I-premise
causes I-premise
some I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
internal I-premise
obligation I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
inasmuch I-premise
as I-premise
we I-premise
always I-premise
care I-premise
about I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise

and I-premise
we I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
waste I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
time B-claim
management I-claim
is I-claim
another I-claim
brilliant I-claim
benefit I-claim
of I-claim
group I-claim
- I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
strongly I-claim
prefer I-claim
studying I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
group I-claim
of I-claim
my I-claim
friends I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
some I-claim
important I-claim
opportunities I-claim
gaining I-claim
with I-claim
this I-claim
activity I-claim
. O

I B-claim
can I-claim
receive I-claim
some I-claim
helps I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
student I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
improving I-claim
my I-claim
learning I-claim
skills I-claim
, I-claim
also I-claim
managing I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
is I-claim
another I-claim
achievements I-claim
of I-claim
group I-claim
- I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

Now O
, O
it O
is O
time O
to O
start O
without O
any O
regret O
from O
my O
previous O
exams O
. O

Should O
animals O
be O
free O
or O
live O
in O
zoos O
? O

Many O
people O
state O
that O
zoos O
are O
a O
great O
asset O
to O
animals O
. O

Others O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
inferior O
creatures O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
deserve O
our O
attention O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we B-claim
must I-claim
help I-claim
animals I-claim
live I-claim
safely I-claim
and I-claim
comfortably I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Many B-claim
scientific I-claim
studies I-claim
have I-claim
revealed I-claim
the I-claim
detriment I-claim
that I-claim
zoos I-claim
have I-claim
caused I-claim
to I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
like B-premise
we I-premise
, I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
, I-premise
animals I-premise
are I-premise
delivered I-premise
to I-premise
this I-premise
world I-premise
with I-premise
genetic I-premise
instincts I-premise
. O

Skills O
which O
help O
them O
live O
and O
survive O
in O
their O
residing O
areas O
. O

When B-premise
we I-premise
captivate I-premise
animals I-premise
and I-premise
put I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
a I-premise
style I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
unfamiliar I-premise
with I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
begin I-premise
to I-premise
loose I-premise
those I-premise
in I-premise
- I-premise
born I-premise
instincts I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
when B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
released I-premise
or I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
worst I-premise
case I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
escape I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
act I-premise
disorientated I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
contributes I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
animal I-premise
mortality I-premise
rate I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
previous O
point O
, O
various B-claim
zoos I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
proper I-claim
implements I-claim
or I-claim
policies I-claim
that I-claim
assure I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
animal I-claim
care I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I O
recall O
my O
first O
trip O
to O
a O
zoo O
, O
at O
age O
eight O
. O

I B-premise
was I-premise
shocked I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
cruelty I-premise
which I-premise
animals I-premise
were I-premise
treated I-premise
. O

I B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
think I-premise
of I-premise
any I-premise
staff I-premise
memeber I-premise
who I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
improper I-premise
behaviour I-premise
towards I-premise
the I-premise
animlas I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
. O

They B-premise
beat I-premise
them I-premise
up I-premise
because O
they B-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
wanted I-premise
to I-premise
eat I-premise
their I-premise
meals I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
excused I-premise
themselves I-premise
saying I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
train I-premise
the I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
we B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
assit I-claim
animals I-claim
and I-claim
provide I-claim
them I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
possible I-claim
. O

Scientific B-claim
facts I-claim
showed I-claim
the I-claim
damage I-claim
that I-claim
zoos I-claim
can I-claim
inflict I-claim
on I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
many B-claim
zoos I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
meet I-claim
the I-claim
standards I-claim
of I-claim
care I-claim
required I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
. O

A O
university O
plans O
to O
devlope O
a O
new O
research O
centre O
in O
your O
country O
Most O
of O
the O
universities O
in O
the O
world O
seek O
to O
develop O
some O
research O
in O
some O
countries O
. O

These O
researches O
can O
be O
aimed O
for O
several O
fields O
such O
as O
business O
or O
agriculture O
. O

If B-claim
a I-claim
university I-claim
plans I-claim
to I-claim
develop I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
research I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
country I-claim
and I-claim
I I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
between I-claim
establishing I-claim
a I-claim
centre I-claim
for I-claim
business I-claim
research I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
centre I-claim
for I-claim
agriculture I-claim
research I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
would I-claim
opt I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
second I-claim
one I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
my B-premise
country I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
land I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
useful I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
agriculture I-premise
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
lands I-premise
are I-premise
left I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
treatment I-premise
. O

The B-claim
centre I-claim
for I-claim
research I-claim
in I-claim
agriculture I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
my I-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
citizens I-claim
to I-claim
better I-claim
exploit I-claim
these I-claim
land I-claim
. O

This B-claim
centre I-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
there I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
their I-claim
issues I-claim
related I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
land I-claim
. O

Especially B-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
knowledge I-premise
or I-premise
education I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
field I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
centre I-claim
for I-claim
research I-claim
in I-claim
agriculture I-claim
helps I-claim
the I-claim
economy I-claim
of I-claim
my I-claim
country I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
. O

The B-premise
agriculture I-premise
field I-premise
has I-premise
only I-premise
thirty I-premise
percent I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
market I-premise
part I-premise
. O

The B-premise
centre I-premise
of I-premise
research I-premise
can I-premise
raise I-premise
the I-premise
market I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
field I-premise
by I-premise
developing I-premise
the I-premise
agriculture I-premise
products I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
dates I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
agriculture I-premise
product I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
. O

The B-premise
centre I-premise
of I-premise
research I-premise
for I-premise
agriculture I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
some I-premise
research I-premise
in I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
product I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
treat I-premise
the I-premise
Palme I-premise
and I-premise
maybe I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
treat I-premise
the I-premise
land I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
palms I-premise
. O

Another B-claim
reason I-claim
that I-claim
makes I-claim
the I-claim
centre I-claim
of I-claim
research I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
agriculture I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
centre I-claim
of I-claim
business I-claim
research I-claim
is I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
first I-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

Obviously O
, O
showing B-premise
people I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
exploit I-premise
a I-premise
land I-premise
and I-premise
get I-premise
good I-premise
agriculture I-premise
products I-premise
will I-premise
push I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
about I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
field I-premise
of I-premise
agriculture I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
business I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
field I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
a B-claim
centre I-claim
of I-claim
business I-claim
research I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
because O
we B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
in I-premise
parallel I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
advanced I-premise
countries I-premise
which I-premise
have I-premise
focused I-premise
in I-premise
business I-premise
field I-premise
. O

For O
me O
being B-premise
a I-premise
developed I-premise
country I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
mean I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
business I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
what I-premise
really I-premise
bring I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
level I-premise
of I-premise
self I-premise
satisfaction I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
agriculture I-premise
for I-premise
our I-premise
country I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
field I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
. O

My B-claim
country I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
focus I-claim
more I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
agriculture I-claim
by I-claim
establishing I-claim
centers I-claim
for I-claim
research I-claim
in I-claim
this I-claim
field I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
very I-claim
positive I-claim
consequences I-claim
on I-claim
agriculture I-claim
people I-claim
work I-claim
, I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
economy I-claim
and I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
employment I-claim
. O

People O
learn O
in O
different O
ways O
and O
what O
teaching O
method O
do O
you O
prefer O
? O

People O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
to O
learn O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
use O
several O
ways O
to O
broaden O
their O
knowledge O
and O
their O
skills O
. O

One B-claim
of I-claim
these I-claim
several I-claim
ways I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
that I-claim
I I-claim
prefer I-claim
is I-claim
doing I-claim
things I-claim
by I-claim
my I-claim
self I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
learning I-claim
by I-claim
reading I-claim
about I-claim
things I-claim
or I-claim
learning I-claim
by I-claim
listening I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
talking I-claim
about I-claim
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
to O
recommend O
this O
method O
for O
who O
is O
serious O
about O
learning O
some O
thing O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
learning B-claim
by I-claim
doing I-claim
things I-claim
develops I-claim
our I-claim
maturity I-claim
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
things I-premise
by I-premise
your I-premise
self I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
learn I-premise
to I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
yourself I-premise
. O

You B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
in I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
refer I-premise
to I-premise
books I-premise
or I-premise
persons I-premise
. O

The B-premise
fact I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
things I-premise
by I-premise
ourselves I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
some I-premise
experiences I-premise
that I-premise
would I-premise
strong I-premise
our I-premise
maturity I-premise
. O

For O
example O
if B-premise
some I-premise
one I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
leader I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
experience I-premise
this I-premise
by I-premise
being I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
real I-premise
situation I-premise
of I-premise
leading I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
a I-premise
situation I-premise
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
leaders I-premise
by I-premise
reading I-premise
books I-premise
or I-premise
by I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
person I-premise
talking I-premise
about I-premise
leading I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
learning B-claim
by I-claim
doing I-claim
things I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
exciting I-claim
than I-claim
learning I-claim
by I-claim
reading I-claim
about I-claim
things I-claim
or I-claim
listening I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
talking I-claim
about I-claim
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
things I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
that I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
learnt I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Reading B-premise
about I-premise
things I-premise
or I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
talking I-premise
about I-premise
can I-premise
rarely I-premise
submit I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
sensation I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
excitement I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
thing I-premise
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
swim I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
beach I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
swimpool I-premise
and I-premise
laid I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
water I-premise
to I-premise
feel I-premise
and I-premise
know I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
swimming I-premise
. O

Nor B-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
or I-premise
reading I-premise
about I-premise
can I-premise
teach I-premise
them I-premise
swimming I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
that O
makes O
learning O
by O
doing O
things O
more O
advantageous O
than O
learning O
by O
reading O
about O
things O
or O
listening O
to O
people O
talking O
about O
is O
that O
we B-premise
find I-premise
more I-premise
motivation I-premise
to I-premise
continuing I-premise
on I-premise
learning I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
things I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
Reading I-premise
about I-premise
things I-premise
or I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
talking I-premise
about I-premise
could I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
boring I-premise
. O

Learning B-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
things I-premise
gives I-premise
us I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
pleasure I-premise
especially I-premise
if I-premise
we I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
learning I-premise
perfectly I-premise
this I-premise
things I-premise
. O

So O
we B-claim
become I-claim
motivated I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
other I-claim
things I-claim
by I-claim
doing I-claim
them I-claim
. O

The O
history O
shows O
that O
learning B-claim
by I-claim
doing I-claim
things I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
method I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
things I-claim
. O

People O
should O
not O
depend O
only O
on O
reading O
or O
listening O
to O
people O
talking O
about O
things O
to O
learn O
. O

They O
should O
try O
and O
keep O
trying O
until O
they O
learn O
what O
they O
want O
to O
learn O
. O

Cheap O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
encouraged O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
many O
airlines O
offer O
to O
their O
customers O
more O
and O
more O
number O
of O
cheap O
flights O
. O

People O
have O
various O
different O
views O
about O
cheap O
air O
travel O
. O

Although O
there B-claim
are I-claim
good I-claim
arguments I-claim
in I-claim
favour I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
trend I-claim
should O
be O
encouraged O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
cheap B-claim
flight I-claim
can I-claim
make I-claim
many I-claim
serious I-claim
problem I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
cheap B-claim
air I-claim
fares I-claim
have I-claim
broadened I-claim
travel I-claim
possibilities I-claim
for I-claim
many I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
particularly I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
lower I-claim
income I-claim
group I-claim
. O

These B-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
millions I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
travel I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
for I-premise
work I-premise
or I-premise
pleasure I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
careers I-premise
, I-premise
broad I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
interact I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
varied I-premise
cultural I-premise
backgrounds I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
travels B-claim
also I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
promote I-claim
the I-claim

many I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
growing B-claim
of I-claim
cheap I-claim
flights I-claim
really I-claim
have I-claim
negative I-claim
impact I-claim

environment I-claim
. O

Apparently O
, O
more B-premise
flights I-premise
could I-premise
mean I-premise
bigger I-premise
and I-premise
busier I-premise
airport I-premise
that I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
grown I-premise
the I-premise

for I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
close I-premise
to I-premise
it I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
biggest I-premise
concern I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise
. O

Burning B-premise
plane I-premise
fuel I-premise
can I-premise
releases I-premise
carbon I-premise

into I-premise
environment I-premise
that I-premise
cause I-premise
the I-premise
Earth I-premise
to I-premise
heat I-premise
up I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while B-premise
many I-premise
efforts I-premise
are I-premise
being I-premise
made I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
CO2 I-premise
emissions I-premise
from I-premise
cars I-premise
and I-premise
factories I-premise
, I-premise
nothing I-premise
is I-premise
being I-premise
done I-premise
to I-premise
reins I-premise
the I-premise
airlines I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
the B-claim
drawbacks I-claim
of I-claim
cheap I-claim
air I-claim
fares I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
more O
expensive O
. O

Instead O
, O
people O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
their O
responsibility O
to O
reduce O
the O
emissions O
caused O
by O
their O
lifestyle O
choices O
. O

Improve O
roads O
or O
public O
transports O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
governments O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
improving O
roads O
and O
highways O
while O
the O
others O
say O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
public O
transportation O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
certainly I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
system I-claim
because O
it B-claim
would I-claim
deal I-claim
with I-claim
problems I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
rising I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
private I-claim
cars I-claim
is I-claim
creating I-claim
. O

First O
, O
the B-claim
using I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
reduces I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
resources I-claim
using I-claim
on I-claim
transportation I-claim
. O

Cars B-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
gasoline I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
renewable I-premise
resource I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-premise
more I-premise
cars I-premise
we I-premise
use I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
faster I-premise
gasoline I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
world I-premise
is I-premise
used I-premise
up I-premise
. O

In O
the O
contrary O
, O
if B-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
is I-premise
efficiently I-premise
used I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
gasoline I-premise
consuming I-premise
per I-premise
person I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
much I-premise
lower I-premise
. O

And O
this B-premise
definitely I-premise
helps I-premise
to I-premise
reserve I-premise
our I-premise
invaluable I-premise
natural I-premise
resource I-premise
, I-premise
gasoline I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
public B-claim
transportation I-claim
helps I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

Averagely O
, O
public B-premise
transports I-premise
use I-premise
much I-premise
less I-premise
gasoline I-premise
to I-premise
carry I-premise
people I-premise
than I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise
. O

It B-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
public I-premise
transports I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
less I-premise
gas I-premise
exhaust I-premise
is I-premise
pumped I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
and I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
no I-premise
longer I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
bear I-premise
the I-premise
stuffy I-premise
situation I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
full I-premise
of I-premise
fumes I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
using B-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
is I-premise
much I-premise
safer I-premise
than I-premise
private I-premise
transportation I-premise
. O

According B-premise
to I-premise
National I-premise
Safety I-premise
Council I-premise
, I-premise
riding I-premise
the I-premise
bus I-premise
is I-premise
over I-premise
170 I-premise
times I-premise
safer I-premise
than I-premise
private I-premise
care I-premise
. O

Thus O
there B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
reason I-claim
that I-claim
governments I-claim
should I-claim
hesitate I-claim
to I-claim
invest I-claim
in I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
, I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
, I-claim
safe I-claim
and I-claim
economical I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
transporting I-claim
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
can O
say O
for O
certain O
that O
spending B-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
improving I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
because O
it B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
key I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
our I-claim
world I-claim
, I-claim
creating I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
and I-claim
safe I-claim
environment I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
Earth O
is O
being O
harmed O
by O
human O
Whether O
human O
activity O
is O
making O
the O
Earth O
a O
better O
place O

or O
damaging O
it O
is O
a O
debatable O
issue O
. O

Some O
people O
advocate O
the O
idea O
that O
human O

advantageously O
influencing O

the O
Earth O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
human B-claim
activities I-claim
are I-claim
having I-claim
a I-claim
bad I-claim
effect I-claim
upon I-claim
our I-claim
planet I-claim
, O
for O
human B-claim
are I-claim
polluting I-claim
the I-claim
Earth I-claim

exhausting I-claim
natural I-claim

threatening I-claim
the I-claim
living I-claim

People B-claim
are I-claim
corrupting I-claim
their I-claim
ecosphere I-claim

In B-premise
recent I-premise
decades I-premise
, I-premise
concurrently I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
increase I-premise

human I-premise
consume I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
waste I-premise
discarded I-premise
by I-premise
human I-premise
also I-premise
multiplies I-premise
. O

These B-premise
wastes I-premise
including I-premise
household I-premise
waste I-premise
and I-premise
industrial I-premise
waste I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
big I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise

now I-premise
being I-premise
formed I-premise

. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
industrial I-premise
exhaust I-premise
gases I-premise
are I-premise
adulterating I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
, I-premise
causing I-premise
the I-premise
insalubrious I-premise
phenomenon I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
acid I-premise

global I-premise
warming I-premise
or I-premise
climate I-premise
change I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
people B-claim
are I-claim
draining I-claim
the I-claim
Earth I-claim

natural I-claim
resources I-claim
. O

These B-premise
resources I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
oil I-premise

coal I-premise
are I-premise
vital I-premise
for I-premise
human I-premise
activity I-premise
, O
therefore O
nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
exploitation I-premise

these I-premise

increasing I-premise
dramatically I-premise

the I-premise

Researchers B-premise

that I-premise
most I-premise

only I-premise

the I-premise
Earth I-premise

totally I-premise

At B-premise
that I-premise

human I-premise

be I-premise
seriously I-premise

the I-premise

Also O
, O
people B-claim

Hunting B-premise

been I-premise
a I-premise
fundamental I-premise
activity I-premise

Through B-premise
million I-premise

in I-premise
recent I-premise
centuries I-premise

the I-premise

even I-premise

made I-premise
some I-premise

Moreover O
, O
people B-premise

consequently O

the B-premise

This B-premise

All O

more I-claim

According B-premise

a I-premise

conducted I-premise

the I-premise
International I-premise

that I-premise
the I-premise

In O
short O

the B-premise

Furthermore O

Just B-premise

I O

To O
sum O
up O

although O

I B-claim

luck I-claim
to I-claim
reach I-claim
one I-claim

Therefore O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
the O
argument O
that O
it B-claim

work I-claim
that I-claim

First O

if B-claim
you I-claim

only I-claim

all I-claim
your I-claim

you I-claim
are I-claim
taking I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim

Luck B-premise
is I-premise
something I-premise
intangible I-premise
and I-premise
no I-premise

can I-premise
guarantee I-premise

ever I-premise
come I-premise
your I-premise
way I-premise

If B-premise
it I-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise

Instead O
if B-premise
you I-premise
strive I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
what I-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise

then I-premise
your I-premise
hard I-premise
work I-premise

take I-premise
you I-premise

your I-premise
final I-premise
goal I-premise

In O
my O
personal O

all B-claim
my I-claim

my I-claim
hard I-claim

my I-claim

. O

And O
I B-premise
never I-premise

encounter I-premise

Secondly O

if O
you O

the O

it O

you O

In O
other O
words O
, O
those B-claim
who I-claim
believe I-claim
in I-claim
hard I-claim
work I-claim
are I-claim
clear I-claim
about I-claim
their I-claim
goals I-claim

know I-claim
about I-claim
their I-claim
final I-claim

They B-premise
carefully I-premise
organize I-premise
the I-premise
process I-premise

continue I-premise

evaluate I-premise
their I-premise

If B-premise

had I-premise
the I-premise
habit I-premise
of I-premise
buying I-premise
lottery I-premise
tickets I-premise
thinking I-premise
that I-premise
one I-premise
day I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
win I-premise
a I-premise
lottery I-premise
. O

He B-premise
was I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
illusion I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
solve I-premise
his I-premise
financial I-premise
issues I-premise
with I-premise
this I-premise
lottery I-premise
. O

However O
, O
up B-premise
to I-premise
this I-premise
day I-premise
his I-premise
luck I-premise
has I-premise
not I-premise
appeared I-premise
and I-premise
problems I-premise
have I-premise
got I-premise
further I-premise
worsened I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
if B-claim
you I-claim
work I-claim
hard I-claim
, I-claim
luck I-claim
too I-claim
might I-claim
shine I-claim
on I-claim
you I-claim
and I-claim
take I-claim
you I-claim
some I-claim
more I-claim
steps I-claim
further I-claim
ahead I-claim
from I-claim
your I-claim
actual I-claim
target I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
boss I-premise
worked I-premise
tirelessly I-premise
for I-premise
his I-premise
promotion I-premise
. O

He B-premise
looked I-premise
at I-premise
every I-premise
aspect I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
needed I-premise
to I-premise
qualify I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
promotion I-premise
. O

He B-premise
realized I-premise
that I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
master I-premise
's I-premise
degree I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
credential I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
outperform I-premise
his I-premise
competitors I-premise
. O

Although O
he B-premise
had I-premise
many I-premise
commitments I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
somehow I-premise
managed I-premise
to I-premise
complete I-premise
this I-premise
degree I-premise
before I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
eligible I-premise
to I-premise
apply I-premise
. O

At B-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
promotion I-premise
amidst I-premise
a I-premise
stiff I-premise
competition I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
got I-premise
nominated I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
scholarship I-premise
since O
he B-premise
had I-premise
more I-premise
credentials I-premise
than I-premise
other I-premise
officers I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
capacity I-premise
. O

Although O
it B-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
lucky I-premise
, O
depending B-claim
on I-claim
luck I-claim
for I-claim
everything I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
good I-claim
. O

Hence O
I B-claim
strongly I-claim
believe I-claim
in I-claim
hard I-claim
working I-claim
that I-claim
would I-claim
not I-claim
easily I-claim
disappoint I-claim
you I-claim
as I-claim
luck I-claim
sometimes I-claim
does I-claim
. O

Should O
students O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
? O

The O
issue O
at O
hand O
is O
whether O
it O
should O
be O
obligatory O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
classes O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
question O
because O
it O
affects O
a O
great O
amount O
of O
students O
worldwide O
. O

Nonetheless O
there O
are O
various O
different O
policies O
regarding O
this O
topic O
. O

An O
important O
aspect O
might O
be O
whether O
one O
desires O
to O
optimize O
the O
learned O
knowledge O
or O
the O
amount O
of O
valuable O
experiences O
for O
the O
students O
. O

However O
, O
to O
my O
mind O
students B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
free I-claim
not I-claim
to I-claim
attend I-claim
classes I-claim
because O
it B-claim
improves I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
student I-claim
life I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
their I-claim
learning I-claim
motivation I-claim
and I-claim
teaches I-claim
important I-claim
life I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
a O
liberal O
policy O
is O
very O
feasible O
. O

Checking O
for O
attendance O
requires O
a O
lot O
of O
bureaucracy O
. O

Especially O
for O
larger O
classes O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
check O
for O
everybody O
to O
attend O
. O

So O
an O
optional O
attendance O
saves O
time O
and O
money O
. O

Secondly O
, O
some B-claim
students I-claim
might I-claim
learn I-claim
better I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
, I-claim
for I-claim
instance I-claim
, I-claim
by I-claim
reading I-claim
the I-claim
textbook I-claim
. O

This B-premise
problem I-premise
occurs I-premise
especially I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
lecturer I-premise
is I-premise
lethargic I-premise
. O

By B-premise
letting I-premise
students I-premise
choose I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
class I-premise
you I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
escape I-premise
bad I-premise
teaching I-premise
. O

Thus O
they B-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
save I-premise
precious I-premise
study I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
dive I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
course I-premise
syllabus I-premise
independently I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
being B-claim
free I-claim
to I-claim
stay I-claim
away I-claim
from I-claim
classes I-claim
improves I-claim
flexibility I-claim
and I-claim
therefore I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
student I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Sometimes B-premise
the I-premise
wild I-premise
party I-premise
on I-premise
Thursday I-premise
night I-premise
is I-premise
too I-premise
good I-premise
to I-premise
end I-premise
already I-premise
at I-premise
midnight I-premise
only I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
lecture I-premise
on I-premise
Friday I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
. O

With B-premise
a I-premise
liberal I-premise
policy I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
postpone I-premise
the I-premise
learning I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
afternoon I-premise
which I-premise
gives I-premise
a I-premise
feeling I-premise
of I-premise
freedom I-premise
and I-premise
improves I-premise
time I-premise
efficiency I-premise
. O

Research B-premise
has I-premise
shown I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
satisfied I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
with I-premise
those I-premise
life I-premise
aspects I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
better I-premise
they I-premise
perform I-premise
in I-premise
academic I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
psychology O
knows O
two O
types O
of O
motivation O
. O

There O
is O
intrinsic O
motivation O
which O
comes O
from O
your O
own O
mindset O
. O

And O
there O
is O
extrinsic O
motivation O
which O
comes O
from O
the O
praise O
and O
laud O
of O
other O
people O
. O

Intrinsic B-premise
motivation I-premise
is I-premise
known I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
desirable I-premise
because I-premise
it I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
better I-premise
learning I-premise
and I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
being I-premise
. O

However O
, O
in B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
gain I-premise
intrinsic I-premise
motivation I-premise
students I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
strengths I-premise
and I-premise
aims I-premise
. O

By B-claim
giving I-claim
students I-claim
the I-claim
freedom I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
about I-claim
class I-claim
attendance I-claim
they I-claim
might I-claim
rather I-claim
be I-claim
thinking I-claim
about I-claim
why I-claim
they I-claim
decided I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
and I-claim
learn I-claim
to I-claim
motivate I-claim
themselves I-claim
. O

These B-premise
are I-premise
crucial I-premise
skills I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
duration I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
study I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
whole I-premise
life I-premise
time I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
clear I-claim
that I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
classes I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
optional I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
. O

I B-claim
hold I-claim
this I-claim
belief I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
improvement I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
current I-claim
experience I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
valuable I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
knowledge I-claim
they I-claim
obtain I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
whole I-claim
life I-claim
afterwards I-claim
. O

Living O
in O
smal O
towns O
Place O
of O
living O
has O
the O
most O
significant O
affect O
on O
our O
lives O
and O
we O
have O
to O
choose O
it O
according O
to O
several O
factors O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
tall O
buildings O
and O
crowded O
areas O
, O
whereas O
others O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
a O
small O
and O
calm O
town O
. O

I B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
town I-claim
and O

I B-claim
think I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
town I-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
good I-claim
weather I-claim
, I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
life I-claim
and I-claim
better I-claim
facilities I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-premise
first I-premise
advantage I-premise
of I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
healthy I-premise
life I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
obtain I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
many I-premise
items I-premise
. O

One B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
conditions I-premise
that I-premise
helps I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
healthy I-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
weather I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
population I-premise
that I-premise
exist I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
crowded I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
traffic I-premise
. O

Living B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
with I-premise
less I-premise
pollution I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
or I-premise
sound I-premise
pollution I-premise
helps I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
healthier I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
main I-premise
consequences I-premise
is I-premise
less I-premise
stress I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
happiness I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
foods I-premise
and I-premise
materials I-premise
we I-premise
need I-premise
are I-premise
healthier I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
fresh I-premise
foods I-premise
and I-premise
fruits I-premise
. O

Regardless O
of O
some O
exceptions O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
obvious I-claim
that I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
is I-claim
healthier I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
another B-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
is I-claim
living I-claim
costs I-claim
. O

Living B-premise
cost I-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
important I-premise
concerns I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
society I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
living I-premise
cost I-premise
is I-premise
fewer I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
houses I-premise
with I-premise
good I-premise
landscapes I-premise
, O
also O
because B-premise
of I-premise
less I-premise
crowded I-premise
spaces I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
services I-premise
. O

Transportation B-premise
cost I-premise
is I-premise
less I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
less I-premise
traffic I-premise
so O
that O
we B-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
money I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
town I-claim
and O
I O
think O
it B-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
less I-claim
stress I-claim
, I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
better I-claim
weather I-claim
conditions I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
, I-claim
better I-claim
relationship I-claim
within I-claim
a I-claim
town I-claim
. O

In B-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
people I-premise
know I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
better I-premise
deal I-premise
together I-premise
than I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
therefore O
on B-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
people I-premise
feel I-premise
alone I-premise
and I-premise
depress I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
small I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

However O
it O
is O
an O
obvious O
fact O
that O
people B-premise
in I-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
friendship I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
illness I-premise
and I-premise
stress I-premise
. O

Young O
people O
move O
to O
cities O
These O
days O
, O
there O
are O
increasing O
numbers O
of O
young O
people O
from O
the O
countryside O
moving O
to O
cities O
in O
search O
of O
jobs O
and O
educational O
opportunities O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
it O
has O
some O
drawbacks O
that O
will O
be O
discussed O
in O
this O
essay O
together O
with O
some O
reasons O
about O
this O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
the O
major O
cause O
that O
leads O
to O
urban O
migration O
of O
young O
adults O
is O
that O
cities B-premise
often I-premise
offer I-premise
more I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
paid I-premise
jobs I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
chances I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
rural I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
many B-premise
large I-premise
companies I-premise
and I-premise
universities I-premise
often I-premise
locate I-premise
in I-premise
cities I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
hailed I-premise
as I-premise
promising I-premise
lands I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
career I-premise
. O

Therefore O
they B-claim
move I-claim
to I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
to I-claim
pursue I-claim
academic I-claim
career I-claim
and I-claim
find I-claim
jobs I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
higher I-claim
standard I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
gradate I-premise
stays I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
after I-premise
leaving I-premise
his I-premise
college I-premise
and I-premise
seeks I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
with I-premise
good I-premise
salary I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
returning I-premise
his I-premise
village I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
farm I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
could I-premise
perhaps I-premise
buy I-premise
a I-premise
house I-premise
or I-premise
his I-premise
own I-premise
car I-premise
after I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
. O

However O
, O
this O
phenomenon O
sometimes O
poses O
several O
negative O
consequences O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
the B-premise
burgeoning I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
countryside I-premise
flocking I-premise
to I-premise
cities I-premise
gives I-premise
rise I-premise
to I-premise
overpopulation I-premise
in I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
cities B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
provide I-claim
adequate I-claim
space I-claim
for I-claim
thousands I-claim
of I-claim
dwellers I-claim
that I-claim
might I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
poor I-claim
housing I-claim
conditions I-claim
and I-claim
sanitation I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
it B-premise
might I-premise
put I-premise
strain I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

If B-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
cities I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
large I-premise
numbers I-premise
of I-premise
vehicles I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
road I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
causes I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
young B-claim
people I-claim
tend I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
or I-claim
work I-claim
in I-claim
urban I-claim
areas I-claim
since O
these B-premise
provide I-premise
them I-premise
many I-premise
educational I-premise
opportunities I-premise
and I-premise
career I-premise
potentials I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
however O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
approve I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
trend I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
low I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
and I-claim
affecting I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Basic O
economic O
class O
can O
help O
the O
students O

the O
surface O
of O
this O
field O

In O
today O
's O
community O
, O
economy O
becomes O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
. O

Getting O
to O
know O
the O
theory O
in O
this O
area O
seems O
really O
important O
for O
our O
students O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
earlier O
we O
jump O
into O
this O
area O
, O
the O
more O
skillful O
we O
will O
be O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
although O
it B-claim
will I-claim
take I-claim
some I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
it I-claim
, O
high B-claim
school I-claim

take I-claim
a I-claim

on I-claim
basic I-claim
economics I-claim
. O

Let O
me O
explain O
it O
in O

. O

For O
the O
primary O
concern O
, O
it B-claim

University O

It O

the O

whether O

Both O

outstanding B-claim
academic I-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
eligible I-claim
for I-claim
university I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
intellectual I-claim
advantage I-claim
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
such B-premise
abstract I-premise
or I-premise
complicated I-premise
informatin I-premise
, I-premise
easily I-premise
absorbed I-premise
by I-premise
those I-premise

may I-premise
prove I-premise

a I-premise
matter I-premise
of I-premise
pressure I-premise
for I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
lack I-premise
equivalent I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
undeniable I-premise
that I-premise
one I-premise
deserves I-premise
what I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
done I-premise
. O

University B-premise
is I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
gift I-premise
presented I-premise

those I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
gone I-premise
to I-premise
great I-premise
length I-premise
to I-premise

. O

However O
, O
university B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
just I-premise
about I-premise
academic I-premise
studies I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
to I-premise
nurture I-premise
artistic I-premise
talent I-premise
and I-premise
develop I-premise
soft I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
up I-claim
for I-claim
grabs I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
majority I-claim
of I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim

who I-claim
wish I-claim
to I-claim
pursue I-claim
their I-claim
passion I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
develop I-claim
comprehensively I-claim
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
there B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
tendency I-claim
for I-claim
social I-claim
vices I-claim
to I-claim
rise I-claim
if I-claim
university I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
restricted I-claim

only I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
people I-claim

Apart B-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
disheartened I-premise
ones I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
devoiding I-premise

neccessary I-premise

likely I-premise

recipes I-premise

when I-premise
applying I-premise

mostly I-premise
the I-premise
white I-premise

collar I-premise
ones I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
university O
restriction O
has O
both O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-claim
will I-claim
yield I-claim
more I-claim
negative I-claim
results I-claim
than I-claim
positive I-claim
ones I-claim
. O

That O
's O
why O
it B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
made I-claim
available I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
wide I-claim
range I-claim
of I-claim
learners I-claim
. O

A O
greater O
proportion O
of O
the O
budget O
should O
be O
allotted O
to O
education O
and O
prevention O
issues O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
welfare O
state O
requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O
health O
education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
devote I-claim
a I-claim
greater I-claim
portion I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
budgets I-claim
to I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
means I-claim
for I-claim
precautions I-claim
. O

The O
first O
reason O
why O
education B-premise
and I-premise
preventative I-premise
measures I-premise
should I-premise
receive I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
budget I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
potential I-premise
improvements I-premise
in I-premise
health I-premise
system I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing B-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise
system I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
hospitals I-premise
and I-premise
healthcare I-premise
centers I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
managed I-premise
effectively I-premise
which I-premise
will I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
better I-premise
treatments I-premise
for I-premise
current I-premise
patients I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
society B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
educated I-claim
and I-claim
became I-claim
aware I-claim
of I-claim
health I-claim
issues I-claim
so I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
potential I-claim
precautions I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
illnesses I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
taken I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
trying I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
treatment I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
increasing I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
patients I-claim
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
allocate I-claim
more I-claim
budget I-claim
on I-claim
prevention I-claim
from I-claim
illness I-claim
and I-claim
providing I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
welfare I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
nothing I-premise
more I-premise
important I-premise
than I-premise
health I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
welfare I-premise
come I-premise
with I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
a B-premise
government I-premise
's I-premise
role I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
providing I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
lead I-premise
its I-premise
citizens I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
from I-premise
potential I-premise
illness I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
cause I-premise
misery I-premise
in I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
marketing I-premise
campaign I-premise
of I-premise
Ministry I-premise
of I-premise
Health I-premise
in I-premise
Turkey I-premise
which I-premise
aimed I-premise
smoking I-premise
problem I-premise
among I-premise
the I-premise
youth I-premise
increased I-premise
the I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
being I-premise
of I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
quit I-premise
smoking I-premise
and I-premise
adapted I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
campaign I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
greater I-claim
proportion I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
budget I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
allotted I-claim
to I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
prevention I-claim
issues I-claim
in I-claim
comparison I-claim
with I-claim
treatment I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
more I-claim
effective I-claim
health I-claim
system I-claim
and I-claim
greater I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim

Work O
in O
team O
or O
independently O
Nowadays O
, O
as O
the O
world O
is O
getting O
smaller O
, O
we O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
cooperate O
. O

Working O
in O
team O
is O
a O
necessary O
skill O
that O
every O
individual O
must O
master O
for O
success O
. O

Despite O
the O
importance O
of O
working O
in O
team O
, O
I O
still O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
capability I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
independly I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
significant I-claim
. O

Of O
course O
, O
effective B-premise
cooperation I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
things I-premise
easier I-premise
and I-premise
faster I-premise
, O
but O
in B-premise
many I-premise
important I-premise
cases I-premise
when I-premise
team I-premise
- I-premise
working I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
possible I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
alone I-premise
will I-premise
help I-premise
. O

The B-premise
apperant I-premise
example I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
tests I-premise
that I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
allow I-premise
team I-premise
- I-premise
working I-premise
. O

Let B-premise
's I-premise
imagine I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
perform I-premise
really I-premise
well I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
discuss I-premise
the I-premise
problems I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
experience I-premise
of I-premise
working I-premise
alone I-premise
, I-premise
standardized I-premise
tests I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
SAT I-premise
, I-premise
TOEFL I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
your I-premise
nightmares I-premise
. O

Testing B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
aspect I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
still I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
tests I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
allow I-premise
you I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
team I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
if B-claim
you I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
brilliant I-claim
achievements I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
college I-claim
, I-claim
acing I-claim
your I-claim
school I-claim
's I-claim
final I-claim
tests I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
should I-claim
consider I-claim
learning I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
on I-claim
your I-claim
own I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
alone I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
you I-claim
increase I-claim
your I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Working B-premise
in I-premise
team I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
mean I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
come I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
your I-premise
ideas I-premise
. O

Everybody B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
must I-premise
have I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
own I-premise
opinion I-premise
first I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
discuss I-premise
them I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
members I-premise
. O

When B-premise
we I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
team I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
still I-premise
think I-premise
individually I-premise
because O
our B-premise
brain I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
connected I-premise
but I-premise
separate I-premise
. O

When B-premise
everyone I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
can I-premise
come I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
own I-premise
ideas I-premise
, I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
team I-premise
will I-premise
definitely I-premise
more I-premise
effective I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
working O
with O
a O
group O
a O
people O
and O
working O
individually O
are O
all O
important O
. O

Both O
skills O
are O
necessary O
for O
a O
successful O
life O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the B-claim
capablity I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
alone I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
foundation I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
skill I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
in I-claim
team I-claim
and I-claim
plays I-claim
a I-claim
significant I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
situations I-claim
. O

Smoking O
should O
not O
be O
promitted O
in O
restaurants O
or O
other O
public O
places O
Smoking O
brings O
a O
person O
great O
enjoyment O
and O
relief O
. O

However O
, O
one O
should O
not O
be O
encouraged O
to O
smoke O
as O
the O
cost O
of O
other O
people O
's O
health O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
I O
advocate O
the O
idea O
that O
smoking B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
prohibited I-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
other I-claim
public I-claim
places I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
support I-claim
states I-claim
laws I-claim
to I-claim
ban I-claim
it I-claim
because O
smoking B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
damages I-claim
the I-claim
restaurant I-claim
's I-claim
environment I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
imposes I-claim
a I-claim
potential I-claim
threat I-claim
on I-claim
others I-claim
' I-claim
health I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
although O
it B-premise
is I-premise
too I-premise
strong I-premise
to I-premise
assert I-premise
that I-premise
smoking I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
prohibited I-premise
everywhere I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
smoking I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
restaurant I-premise
is I-premise
considered I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
his I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
ignorance I-premise
of I-premise
others I-premise
' I-premise
health I-premise
. O

It O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
, O
the B-premise
second I-premise
- I-premise
hand I-premise
smoke I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
comes I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
's I-premise
mouth I-premise
, I-premise
puts I-premise
an I-premise
even I-premise
greater I-premise
threat I-premise
on I-premise
surrounding I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
than I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
only I-premise
one I-premise
person I-premise
smoking I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
restaurant I-premise
, I-premise
all I-premise
others I-premise
will I-premise
smoke I-premise
unconsciously I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
health I-premise
is I-premise
under I-premise
attacked I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
some B-premise
burned I-premise
substance I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
cigarette I-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
deteriorate I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
's I-premise
respiratory I-premise
system I-premise
after I-premise
he I-premise
/ I-premise
she I-premise
inhales I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
smoking B-claim
in I-claim
restaurants I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
strictly I-claim
banned I-claim
because O
it B-premise
makes I-premise
the I-premise
restaurant I-premise
a I-premise
polluted I-premise
place I-premise
which I-premise
threatens I-premise
every I-premise
customer I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
even O
though O
some O
customers O
do O
not O
worry O
about O
the O
threat O
that O
second O
- O
hand O
smoke O
imposes O
on O
them O
, O
the B-claim
disgusting I-claim
smoke I-claim
will I-claim
severely I-claim
affect I-claim
their I-claim
appetite I-claim
, I-claim
or I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
other I-claim
words I-claim
, I-claim
spoil I-claim
their I-claim
meals I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
them I-claim
an I-claim
unpleasant I-claim
experience I-claim
. O

The B-premise
smoke I-premise
exhaled I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
often I-premise
makes I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
feel I-premise
uncomfortable I-premise
or I-premise
disgusted I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
affecting I-premise
their I-premise
mood I-premise
in I-premise
having I-premise
their I-premise
meals I-premise
. O

This B-premise
, I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
hand I-premise
, I-premise
can I-premise
indirectly I-premise
decrease I-premise
the I-premise
restaurants I-premise
' I-premise
popularity I-premise
because O
fewer B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
consume I-premise
there I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
unpleasant I-premise
experiences I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
smoking B-claim
does I-claim
no I-claim
good I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
smoker I-claim
himself I-claim
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
does I-premise
it I-premise
aggravate I-premise
his I-premise
health I-premise
, I-premise
making I-premise
him I-premise
more I-premise
subject I-premise
to I-premise
respiratory I-premise
diseases I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
it I-premise
damages I-premise
his I-premise
public I-premise
image I-premise
and I-premise
reputation I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
especially I-premise
true I-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
popular I-premise
political I-premise
figure I-premise
or I-premise
an I-premise
entertainmening I-premise
celebrity I-premise
, O
because O
most B-premise
people I-premise
see I-premise
smoking I-premise
in I-premise
restaurants I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
impolite I-premise
human I-premise
behavior I-premise
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the B-premise
public I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
lacks I-premise
basic I-premise
civility I-premise
and I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
encouraged I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
public I-premise
leader I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
smoking B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
restaurant I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
harmful I-claim
and I-claim
disrespectable I-claim
behavior I-claim
. O

It B-premise
spoils I-premise
the I-premise
smoker I-premise
's I-premise
reputation I-premise
and I-premise
threats I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
unwise I-claim
to I-claim
smoke I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
restaurant I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
other I-claim
public I-claim
places I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
relevant I-claim
state I-claim
laws I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
codified I-claim
to I-claim
strictly I-claim
prohibit I-claim
it I-claim
. O

People O
should O
have O
hobbies O
and O
do O
physical O
activities O

Whether O
or O
not O
people O
should O
have O
hobbies O
and O
do O
physical O
activities O
has O
been O
a O
controversial O
question O
. O

Different O
people O
have O
different O
ideas O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
we O
should O
focus O
on O
our O
jobs O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

Having B-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
own I-claim
hobbies I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
physical I-claim
activities I-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
us I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

First O
, O
having B-claim
hobbies I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
physical I-claim
activities I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
fit I-claim
. O

Looking B-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
computer I-premise
screen I-premise
all I-premise
day I-premise
long I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
us I-premise
daze I-premise
, O
so O
doing B-premise
some I-premise
sport I-premise
and I-premise
hobbies I-premise
can I-premise
prevent I-premise
us I-premise
from I-premise
becoming I-premise
too I-premise
fat I-premise
or I-premise
short I-premise
- I-premise
sighted I-premise
. O

My B-premise
neighbor I-premise
Tom I-premise
once I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
computer I-premise
engineer I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
company I-premise
. O

He B-premise
ate I-premise
fast I-premise
food I-premise
everyday I-premise
and I-premise
never I-premise
went I-premise
out I-premise
to I-premise
exercise I-premise
. O

When B-premise
he I-premise
found I-premise
out I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
too I-premise
fat I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
girlfriend I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
made I-premise
up I-premise
his I-premise
mind I-premise
to I-premise
loose I-premise
weight I-premise
. O

He B-premise
started I-premise
to I-premise
jog I-premise
every I-premise
morning I-premise
. O

After B-premise
a I-premise
moth I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
thinner I-premise
and I-premise
finds I-premise
a I-premise
girlfriend I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
doing B-premise
something I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
boring I-premise
, O
having B-claim
hobbies I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
sports I-claim
can I-claim
refresh I-claim
our I-claim
mind I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
at B-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
breaks I-premise
every I-premise
class I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
relax I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
minutes I-premise
and I-premise
prepare I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
next I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Humans B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
robots I-premise
; I-premise
we I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
keep I-premise
working I-premise
for I-premise
twenty I-premise
- I-premise
four I-premise
hours I-premise
. O

Doing B-premise
sports I-premise
or I-premise
hobbies I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
can I-premise
recharge I-premise
our I-premise
batteries I-premise
. O

Last O
, O
we B-claim
should I-claim
develop I-claim
at I-claim
least I-claim
one I-claim
personal I-claim
hobby I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
to I-claim
show I-claim
off I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
express I-claim
our I-claim
emotion I-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
feel I-claim
depressed I-claim
or I-claim
pressured I-claim
. O

Playing B-premise
musical I-premise
instrument I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
way I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
play I-premise
classical I-premise
guitar I-premise
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
meet I-premise
difficulties I-premise
in I-premise
studies I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
take I-premise
my I-premise
guitar I-premise
and I-premise
play I-premise
the I-premise
song I-premise
Green I-premise
Sleeves I-premise
. O

It B-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
feel I-premise
better I-premise
and I-premise
gives I-premise
me I-premise
the I-premise
confidence I-premise
. O

Although O
it B-claim
may I-claim
take I-claim
us I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
times I-claim
to I-claim
develop I-claim
our I-claim
personal I-claim
hobbies I-claim
, O
but O
doing B-premise
so I-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
us I-premise
a I-premise
healthy I-premise
body I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
refreshed I-premise
mind I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
release I-premise
pressure I-premise
and I-premise
sadness I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
it B-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
hobbies I-claim
and I-claim
do I-claim
physical I-claim
activities I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
different I-claim
from I-claim
our I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Government O
should O
regard O
investing O
in O
building O
roads O
as O
the O
most O
important O

The O
population O
explosion O
results O
in O
the O
high O
demands O
of O
transportation O
. O

Many O
countries O
have O
suffered O
from O
pollution O
, O
noisy O
and O
casualty O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
the B-claim
most I-claim
possible I-claim
solution I-claim
to I-claim
these I-claim
problems I-claim
is I-claim
improving I-claim
roads I-claim
and I-claim
highways I-claim
because O
of O
three O
crucial O
reasons O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
we B-claim
all I-claim
know I-claim
that I-claim
upgrading I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
will I-claim
surely I-claim
aggravate I-claim
the I-claim
pollution I-claim
and I-claim
accidents I-claim
. O

The B-premise
buses I-premise
, I-premise
cars I-premise
and I-premise
trains I-premise
regularly I-premise
emit I-premise
a I-premise
noxious I-premise
gas I-premise
which I-premise
causes I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
fatal I-premise
diseases I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
lung I-premise
cancer I-premise
and I-premise
pneumonia I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise
sound I-premise
emanates I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
engines I-premise
can I-premise
worsen I-premise
our I-premise
hearing I-premise
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
accidents I-premise
happening I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
buses I-premise
are I-premise
attributed I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
cause I-premise
of I-premise
skyrocketing I-premise
of I-premise
accidents I-premise
. O

Each O
year O
, O
Vietnam B-premise
has I-premise
approximately I-premise
twelve I-premise
thousand I-premise
people I-premise
die I-premise
of I-premise
accidents I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
equivalent I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
death I-premise
toll I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
tsunami I-premise
in I-premise
Japan I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
investing B-claim
in I-claim
roads I-claim
and I-claim
highways I-claim
can I-claim
broaden I-claim
the I-claim
area I-claim
and I-claim
allow I-claim
more I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
buses I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
other I-premise
personal I-premise
vehicles I-premise
can I-premise
move I-premise
easily I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
always I-premise
leave I-premise
school I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
that I-premise
everybody I-premise
rushes I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
and I-premise
hastily I-premise
goes I-premise
home I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
extremely I-premise
troublesome I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
escape I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
crowd I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
in I-premise
only I-premise
one I-premise
hour I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if B-premise
the I-premise
roads I-premise
are I-premise
enlarged I-premise
, I-premise
everyone I-premise
can I-premise
go I-premise
home I-premise
in I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
hardly I-premise
any I-premise
collisions I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
spending B-claim
on I-claim
renovating I-claim
the I-claim
highways I-claim
and I-claim
roads I-claim
can I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
. O

All B-premise
of I-premise
us I-premise
are I-premise
afraid I-premise
of I-premise
moving I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
rough I-premise
roads I-premise
with I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
portholes I-premise
. O

Those B-premise
bad I-premise
conditions I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
terrible I-premise
accidents I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
several I-premise
people I-premise
feel I-premise
worried I-premise
. O

We B-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
accuse I-premise
the I-premise
drivers I-premise
of I-premise
causing I-premise
accidents I-premise
because O
a B-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
responsibility I-premise
belongs I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
authorities I-premise
. O

What B-premise
's I-premise
more I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
smooth I-premise
surface I-premise
makes I-premise
the I-premise
transportation I-premise
and I-premise
movement I-premise
become I-premise
safer I-premise
and I-premise
easier I-premise
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
upgrading I-claim
the I-claim
roads I-claim
which I-claim
I I-claim
mentioned I-claim
above I-claim
are I-claim
totally I-claim
convincing I-claim
and I-claim
indispensable I-claim
. O

I O
am O
usually O
inclined O
to O
this O
idea O

and O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
government O
will O
regard O
the O
investment O
in O
building O
roads O
as O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
. O

The O
best O
way O
of O
learning O
life O
Life O
is O
full O
of O
challenges O
, O
difficulties O
and O
unexpected O
obstacles O
. O

Therefore O
, O
learning O
about O
life O
, O
which O
is O
useful O
for O
foreseeing O
problems O
and O
be O
assertive O
enough O
to O
overcome O
them O
are O
needed O
. O

Two O
main O
ways O
of O
learning O
about O
life O
are O
listening O
to O
the O
advice O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
and O
learning O
through O
personal O
experience O
. O

Both O
ways O
are O
good O
to O
follow O
because O
they O
all O
have O
their O
own O
distinct O
advantages O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
the B-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
life I-claim
through I-claim
listening I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
advice I-claim
of I-claim
family I-claim
and I-claim
friends I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
realistic I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
latter I-claim
. O

Family B-premise
members I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
your I-premise
parents I-premise
are I-premise
experienced I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
so I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
you I-premise
proper I-premise
and I-premise
sincere I-premise
guidance I-premise
on I-premise
every I-premise
aspect I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

And B-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
generation I-premise
with I-premise
you I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
understand I-premise
your I-premise
favorite I-premise
and I-premise
ability I-premise
enough I-premise
to I-premise
tell I-premise
you I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
suitable I-premise
for I-premise
you I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
. O

By B-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
advice I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
definitely I-premise
avoid I-premise
many I-premise
unexpected I-premise
things I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
finding B-claim
out I-claim
life I-claim
through I-claim
personal I-claim
experience I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
you I-claim
become I-claim
more I-claim
independent I-claim
and I-claim
mature I-claim
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
many I-premise
grate I-premise
things I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
missed I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
experience I-premise
it I-premise
by I-premise
yourself I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
friend I-premise
told I-premise
you I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
skydiving I-premise
because I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
so I-premise
dangerous I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
did I-premise
as I-premise
he I-premise
told I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
could I-premise
fail I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
how I-premise
wonderful I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
fall I-premise
freely I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
family B-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
accidentally I-premise
harm I-premise
you I-premise
by I-premise
giving I-premise
you I-premise
advice I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
. O

You B-premise
will I-premise
grow I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
dependent I-premise
and I-premise
reliant I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
free B-premise
yourself I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
what I-premise
you I-premise
desire I-premise
without I-premise
notice I-premise
about I-premise
consequences I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
success I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
choose I-premise
. O

According O
to O
myself O
, O
both O
ways O
are O
good O
, O
but O
I O
prefer O
the O
latter O
. O

It O
is O
because O
growth B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
process I-premise
that I-premise
experience I-premise
is I-premise
indispensable I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
that O
experiencing B-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
life I-claim
by I-claim
myself I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
could I-claim
learn I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
just I-claim
obey I-claim
the I-claim
advice I-claim
. O

Parents O
and O
other O
predecessors O
used O
to O
experience O
their O
own O
life O
by O
themselves O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
the O
younger O
try O
to O
do O
the O
same O
? O

In O
summary O
, O
each O
way O
learning O
life O
has O
its O
own O
benefits O
. O

But O
to O
me O
, O
learning B-claim
about I-claim
life I-claim
through I-claim
personal I-claim
experience I-claim
seems I-claim
more I-claim
appropriate I-claim
. O

Modern O
cooking O
methods O
have O
improved O
our O
life O
- O
style O
significantly O
With O
technology O
advances O
, O
food O
has O
become O
easier O
to O
prepare O
in O
modern O
days O
. O

People O
now O
can O
use O
kitchen O
appliances O
such O
as O
microwave O
and O
toaster O
to O
cook O
their O
meals O
easier O
and O
more O
convenient O
than O
before O
. O

Also O
, O
instant O
food O
products O
take O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
be O
made O
into O
delicious O
meals O
. O

These B-claim
changes I-claim
make I-claim
cooking I-claim
so I-claim
easy I-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim
- I-claim
use I-claim
and I-claim
time I-claim
- I-claim
saving I-claim
as I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
we I-claim
live I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
extent I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
people B-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
other I-claim
activities I-claim
they I-claim
like I-claim
since I-claim
food I-claim
preparation I-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
longer I-claim
time I-claim
- I-claim
consuming I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
such B-premise
a I-premise
change I-premise
has I-premise
liberated I-premise
many I-premise
housewives I-premise
from I-premise
tedious I-premise
cooking I-premise
process I-premise
and I-premise
gave I-premise
them I-premise
additional I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
something I-premise
more I-premise
meaningful I-premise
like I-premise
accompanying I-premise
family I-premise
or I-premise
doing I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
more B-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
sleep I-premise
a I-premise
bit I-premise
later I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
because O
they B-premise
only I-premise
need I-premise
a I-premise
couple I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
breakfasts I-premise
. O

At O
the O
second O
point O
, O
since B-claim
food I-claim
preparation I-claim
has I-claim
become I-claim
easier I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
convenient I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
certainly I-claim
great I-claim
to I-claim
preserve I-claim
diverse I-claim
kinds I-claim
of I-claim
foods I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
dishes I-premise
even I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
meal I-premise
and I-premise
choose I-premise
whatever I-premise
they I-premise
like I-premise
. O

More B-premise
men I-premise
, I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
hand I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
cooking I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
had I-premise
never I-premise
done I-premise
before I-premise
. O

This B-claim
transformation I-claim
may I-claim
bring I-claim
positive I-claim
impacts I-claim
to I-claim
family I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
cases I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
time I-claim
- I-claim
saving I-claim
, I-claim
simple I-claim
food I-claim
preparation I-claim
process I-claim
gives I-claim
us I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
other I-claim
activities I-claim
, I-claim
more I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
select I-claim
diverse I-claim
kinds I-claim
of I-claim
foods I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
willingness I-claim
to I-claim
cook I-claim
meals I-claim
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
may O
be O
some O
other O
perspectives O
that O
I O
neglected O
to O
fully O
consider O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
for O
the O
reasons O
that O
I O
have O
presented O
above O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
assert I-claim
that I-claim
this I-claim
change I-claim
has I-claim
improved I-claim
our I-claim
life I-claim
significantly I-claim
. O

Are O
parents O
best O
teachers O
? O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
first I-claim
teachers I-claim
who I-claim
teach I-claim
babies I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
walk I-claim
and I-claim
speak I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
person I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents B-claim
provide I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
social I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
knowledge I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
. O

First O
, O
children B-claim
are I-claim
taught I-claim
basic I-claim
things I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
influence I-claim
their I-claim
whole I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
by I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

As B-premise
a I-premise
baby I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
any I-premise
thing I-premise
all I-premise
around I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
learn I-premise
everything I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Parents B-premise
always I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
explain I-premise
and I-premise
describe I-premise
tenderly I-premise
all I-premise
things I-premise
in I-premise
simple I-premise
way I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
their I-premise
baby I-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
from I-premise
that I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
parents B-premise
bring I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
world I-premise
of I-premise
wonderful I-premise
and I-premise
colorful I-premise
thing I-premise
into I-premise
their I-premise
baby I-premise
's I-premise
little I-premise
mind I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
parents B-claim
train I-claim
their I-claim
child I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
person I-claim
. O

They B-premise
always I-premise
make I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
basically I-premise
say I-premise
thanks I-premise
and I-premise
apology I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
way I-premise
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
common I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
explain I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
or I-premise
bad I-premise
person I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children B-premise
are I-premise
shown I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
behave I-premise
well I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
easy O
but O
this B-premise
can I-premise
influence I-premise
positively I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
children I-premise
and I-premise
makes I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
behavior I-premise
better I-premise
before I-premise
they I-premise
face I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
parents B-premise
are I-premise
ones I-premise
who I-premise
loves I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
most I-premise
and I-premise
always I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
they B-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
advice I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
experience I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Unlike B-premise
a I-premise
professional I-premise
, I-premise
parents I-premise
always I-premise
support I-premise
children I-premise
and I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
much I-premise
social I-premise
skill I-premise
so I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
communicate I-premise
well I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
good I-premise
habit I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
parents B-claim
' I-claim
support I-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
factor I-claim
which I-claim
makes I-claim
people I-claim
succeed I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
really I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
teachers I-claim
who I-claim
give I-claim
us I-claim
much I-claim
knowledge I-claim
and I-claim
advice I-claim
. O

Based O
on O
love O
, O
they O
always O
try O
their O
best O
to O
make O
good O
condition O
for O
their O
children O
development O
in O
order O
to O
prepare O
children O

future O
life O
. O

Tv O
has O
NO O
negative O
effects O
on O
children O
Nowadays O
, O
we O
have O
undergone O
many O
technology O
innovations O
such O
as O
Tv O
. O

Many O
people O
say O
that O
television O
has O
negative O
effects O
on O
children O
, O
since O
it O
can O
be O
violent O
or O
inappropriate O
for O
children O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
television B-claim
has I-claim
more I-claim
positive I-claim
effects I-claim
than I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
. O

There O
are O
two O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
idea O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
television B-claim
has I-claim
useful I-claim
and I-claim
educational I-claim
programs I-claim
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
the I-premise
up I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
date I-premise
news I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
programs I-premise
which I-premise
has I-premise
educational I-premise
purposes I-premise
. O

If B-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
those I-premise
programs I-premise
wisely I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
many I-premise
information I-premise
from I-premise
it I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
Korea I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
's I-premise
program I-premise
called I-premise
EBS I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
targeted I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
teenager I-premise
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
study I-premise
subjects I-premise
through I-premise
EBS I-premise
lecture I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
documentary I-premise
films I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
life I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
man I-premise
in I-premise
Korea I-premise
. O

Using B-premise
those I-premise
education I-premise
programs I-premise
let I-premise
people I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
inspirations I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
having I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Tv B-claim
is I-claim
helpful I-claim
to I-claim
relieve I-claim
our I-claim
stresses I-claim
. O

There O
are O
many O
Tv O
programs O
such O
as O
sports O
programs O
. O

Many B-premise
children I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
stresses I-premise
recently I-premise
, O
since O
they B-premise
have I-premise
so I-premise
much I-premise
pressure I-premise
about I-premise
study I-premise
. O

When B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
watching I-premise
sports I-premise
programs I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
relieve I-premise
those I-premise
stresses I-premise
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
I B-premise
got I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
stress I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
school I-premise
. O

So O
, O
I B-premise
was I-premise
quite I-premise
aggressive I-premise
, O
however O
. O

After B-premise
I I-premise
watch I-premise
the I-premise
soccer I-premise
match I-premise
between I-premise
Korea I-premise
and I-premise
Japan I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
stress I-premise
was I-premise
gone I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
this B-premise
soccer I-premise
match I-premise
helped I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
continue I-premise
my I-premise
academic I-premise
career I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
school I-premise
, O
since O
it B-premise
helped I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
relieve I-premise
my I-premise
stress I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the B-claim
television I-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
violent I-claim
programs I-claim
, O
however O
, O
if B-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
Tv I-premise
programs I-premise
wisely I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
positive I-premise
effects I-premise
than I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
. O

Now O
that O
, O
it B-premise
has I-premise
useful I-premise
and I-premise
educational I-premise
programs I-premise
and I-premise
quite I-premise
helpful I-premise
to I-premise
relieve I-premise
stresses I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I B-claim
strongly I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
statement I-claim
that I-claim
television I-claim
has I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
. O

Businesses O
had O
better O
not O
employ O
the O
workers O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
their O
life O
Many O
entrepreneurs O
hypothesize O
that O
it O
is O
safer O
to O
hire O
employees O
for O
their O
entire O
lives O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
productivity O
and O
efficiency O
of O
working O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
those O
assumptions O
are O
not O
only O
conservative O
but O
also O
out O
- O
of O
- O
date O
. O

I O
am O
biased O
towards O
the O
opposite O
side O
that O
businesses B-claim
had I-claim
better I-claim
not I-claim
employ I-claim
the I-claim
workers I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
whole I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
because O
of O
the O
three O
main O
crucial O
reasons O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
various B-claim
ideas I-claim
and I-claim
creativity I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
indispensable I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
company I-claim
to I-claim
flourish I-claim
. O

The B-premise
invaluable I-premise
experience I-premise
of I-premise
senior I-premise
employees I-premise
can I-premise
pass I-premise
down I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
apprentices I-premise
who I-premise
get I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
new I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
regularly I-premise
give I-premise
out I-premise
creative I-premise
and I-premise
novel I-premise
ideas I-premise
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
the B-premise
rapid I-premise
development I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
field I-premise
nowadays I-premise
requires I-premise
precise I-premise
updates I-premise
and I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
new I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-premise
youngsters I-premise
are I-premise
capable I-premise
of I-premise
meeting I-premise
those I-premise
standards I-premise
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
they B-premise
have I-premise
activeness I-premise
, I-premise
inventiveness I-premise
and I-premise
enterprise I-premise
which I-premise
allow I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
complete I-premise
their I-premise
jobs I-premise
perfectly I-premise
. O

These B-premise
vital I-premise
factors I-premise
can I-premise
decide I-premise
whether I-premise
the I-premise
company I-premise
can I-premise
thrive I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
staff I-claim
soon I-claim
gets I-claim
boring I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
stable I-claim
job I-claim
in I-claim
such I-claim
a I-claim
long I-claim
time I-claim
. O

At B-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
presume I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
securing I-premise
job I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
and I-premise
necessary I-premise
because O
they B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
earn I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Thereafter O
, O
the B-premise
bulk I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
high I-premise
promotion I-premise
and I-premise
competition I-premise
can I-premise
assist I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
horizons I-premise
also O
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
enjoy I-premise
challenging I-premise
them I-premise
because O
they B-premise
don I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
monotonous I-premise
and I-premise
passive I-premise
ones I-premise
. O

The B-premise
same I-premise
- I-premise
old I-premise
- I-premise
same I-premise
- I-premise
old I-premise
environment I-premise
soon I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
depressed I-premise
, O
so O
this B-premise
situation I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
adverse I-premise
impact I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
enterprise I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the B-premise
economic I-premise
crisis I-premise
and I-premise
financial I-premise
recession I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
tremendous I-premise
increase I-premise
in I-premise
unemployment I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the B-claim
businesses I-claim
ought I-claim
to I-claim
recruit I-claim
many I-claim
workers I-claim
so I-claim
as I-claim
to I-claim
tackle I-claim
this I-claim
aching I-claim
issue I-claim
. O

It B-premise
enables I-premise
the I-premise
jobless I-premise
to I-premise
better I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
earn I-premise
a I-premise
living I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
factories I-premise
and I-premise
companies I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
abundant I-premise
human I-premise
sources I-premise
to I-premise
ensure I-premise
the I-premise
pace I-premise
of I-premise
manufacture I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
devising I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
unique I-premise
ideas I-premise
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
varied O
characteristics O
of O
various O
people O
, O
feeling O
tired O
of O
having O
the O
same O
occupation O
and O
solving O
the O
unemployed O
problem O
drive O
me O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
the B-claim
employer I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
hire I-claim
the I-claim
staff I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
whole I-claim
life I-claim
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
brilliant B-claim
bosses I-claim
are I-claim
conscious I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
need I-claim
for I-claim
giving I-claim
opportunities I-claim
to I-claim
diverse I-claim
employees I-claim
. O

Childhood O
is O
the O
happiest O
time O
of O
a O
person O
's O
life O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
childhood B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
happiest I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
. O

It B-claim
's I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
the I-claim
lack I-claim
of I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
and I-claim
daily I-claim
struggle I-claim
that I-claim
make I-claim
childhood I-claim
the I-claim
happiest I-claim
time I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
factors I-claim
like I-claim
learning I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
every I-claim
day I-claim
and I-claim
freedom I-claim
to I-claim
imagine I-claim
and I-claim
say I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
think I-claim
. O

Starting B-premise
with I-premise
our I-premise
adulthood I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
strictly I-premise
bounded I-premise
with I-premise
our I-premise
responsibilities I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
daily I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

We B-premise
are I-premise
told I-premise
at I-premise
what I-premise
hour I-premise
we I-premise
shall I-premise
wake I-premise
up I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
we I-premise
shall I-premise
dress I-premise
up I-premise
and I-premise
how I-premise
we I-premise
shall I-premise
behave I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
action I-premise
we I-premise
make I-premise
are I-premise
watched I-premise
closely I-premise
and I-premise
judged I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
community I-premise
. O

But O
during B-claim
our I-claim
childhood I-claim
, I-claim
though I-claim
responsibilies I-claim
exist I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
are I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
free I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
what I-claim
we I-claim
would I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
. O

Being B-premise
late I-premise
for I-premise
school I-premise
or I-premise
laughing I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
where I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
n't I-premise
supposed I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
consequences I-premise
as I-premise
serious I-premise
as I-premise
that I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
were I-premise
an I-premise
adult I-premise
. O

Another B-premise
great I-premise
thing I-premise
about I-premise
being I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
is I-premise
possibility I-premise
learning I-premise
new I-premise
and I-premise
interesting I-premise
things I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
you I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
single I-premise
day I-premise
. O

Being B-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
new I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
every I-premise
single I-premise
thing I-premise
around I-premise
you I-premise
is I-premise
there I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
discovered I-premise
by I-premise
you I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
new I-premise
facts I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
, I-premise
stories I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
and I-premise
things I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
see I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
childhood B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
which I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
is I-claim
surprised I-claim
most I-claim
. O

Using B-claim
your I-claim
imagination I-claim
and I-claim
saying I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
think I-claim
freely I-claim
is I-claim
another I-claim
great I-claim
thing I-claim
about I-claim
being I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
. O

Children B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
judged I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
things I-premise
they I-premise
say I-premise
as I-premise
much I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
adults I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
freedom I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
yourself I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
for I-premise
developing I-premise
a I-premise
colorful I-premise
imagination I-premise
. O

In B-premise
adulthood I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
forced I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
boundaries I-premise
, O
therefore O
they B-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
no I-premise
way I-premise
free I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
or I-premise
use I-premise
their I-premise
imagination I-premise
. O

Childhood B-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
several I-claim
aspects I-claim
, I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
happiest I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

It B-claim
's I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
nature I-claim
of I-claim
childhood I-claim
and I-claim
children I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
are I-claim
changed I-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
are I-claim
adults I-claim
. O

In O
an O
ideal O
world O
with O
less O
boundaries O
, O
social O
judgement O
and O
more O
freedom O
of O
thought O
, O
things O
could O
be O
different O
; O
but O
since O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
we O
will O
always O
be O
missing O
our O
childhood O
days O
. O

Success O
and O
knowledge O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
" O
Past O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
present O
, O
as O
time O
never O
stops O
, O
the O
next O
generations O
are O
completely O
different O
from O
the O
predecessors O
" O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
life B-claim
changes I-claim
rapidly I-claim
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
things I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
about I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
mistakes I-claim
, I-claim
success I-claim
and I-claim
knowledge I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
fields I-claim
of I-claim
study I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the B-premise
predecessors I-premise
' I-premise
mistakes I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
thing I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
should I-premise
consider I-premise
when I-premise
learning I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
. O

As B-premise
everyone I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
too I-premise
short I-premise
to I-premise
risk I-premise
trying I-premise
anything I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
prepare I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
all I-premise
should I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
other I-premise
's I-premise
mistakes I-premise
so O
that O
we B-premise
can I-premise
avoid I-premise
making I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
ones I-premise
. O

Each B-premise
mistake I-premise
, I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
smallest I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
bigger I-premise
one I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
treasure I-premise
of I-premise
experience I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
full I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
, I-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
us I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
prepared I-premise
for I-premise
many I-premise
complicated I-premise
situations I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
past B-claim
obviously I-claim
saves I-claim
ourselves I-claim
a I-claim
bunch I-claim
of I-claim
failures I-claim
and I-claim
times I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
people B-claim
's I-claim
success I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
is I-claim
as I-claim
significant I-claim
as I-claim
those I-claim
mistakes I-claim
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
predecessors I-premise
' I-premise
mistakes I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
indirect I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
leads I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
goals I-premise
, O
others B-premise
' I-premise
accomplishment I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
served I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
direct I-premise
way I-premise

By B-premise
looking I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
ways I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
use I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
their I-premise
targets I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
those I-premise
mine I-premise

put I-premise
them I-premise

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the B-claim
past I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
basis I-claim
in I-claim

people I-claim

How B-premise

They B-premise

only I-premise
some I-premise

many I-premise
precious I-premise
knowledge I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise

We B-premise

in I-premise
any I-premise

All O
in O
all O
, O
the B-claim
past I-claim
's I-claim
mistakes I-claim
, I-claim

all I-claim
have I-claim
crucial I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
people I-claim

We O

for O
a O
better O

Television O
destroys O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
family O
Television O
is O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
innovations O
that O
we O
use O
every O
day O
. O

Besides O
, O
watching O
television O
has O
some O
cons O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
has O
very O
good O
pros O
. O

However O
, O
while O
some O
people O
argue O
that O
TV O
has O
devastated O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
families O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
has O
done O
the O
opposite O
. O

I O
think O
TV B-claim
programs I-claim
are I-claim
among I-claim
the I-claim
popular I-claim
topics I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
day I-claim
talk I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
time I-claim
for I-claim
gathering I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
Modern B-claim
TV I-claim
has I-claim
smart I-claim
system I-claim
that I-claim
let I-claim
you I-claim
be I-claim
connected I-claim
with I-claim
people I-claim
. O

First O
, O
it O
's O
true O
watching B-claim
TV I-claim
take I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
your I-claim
day I-claim
, O
nevertheless O
it B-premise
makes I-premise
people I-premise
meet I-premise
and I-premise
start I-premise
a I-premise
conversation I-premise
about I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
watch I-premise
at I-premise
other I-premise
times I-premise
like I-premise
weather I-premise
forecast I-premise
and I-premise
sport I-premise
programs I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
people B-claim
like I-claim
having I-claim
meals I-claim
while I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
. O

Families B-claim
usually I-claim
tend I-claim
to I-claim
watch I-claim
television I-claim
either I-claim
with I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
or I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

For O
example O
my B-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
sit I-premise
together I-premise
and I-premise
enjoy I-premise
watching I-premise
movies I-premise
using I-premise
VHS I-premise
player I-premise
at I-premise
nights I-premise
. O

It B-premise
was I-premise
fun I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
little I-premise
bit I-premise
similar I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
cinema I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
TV B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
ways I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
TV B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
connected I-premise
to I-premise
multimedia I-premise
devices I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
smart I-premise
operating I-premise
system I-premise
like I-premise
Google I-premise
TV I-premise
, I-premise
WDTV I-premise
using I-premise
Skype I-premise
, I-premise
tango I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
apps I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
Teenagers B-premise
can I-premise
play I-premise
games I-premise
online I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
; O
therefore O
we B-claim
can I-claim
communicate I-claim
with I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
through I-claim
TV I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
TV B-claim
may I-claim
take I-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
your I-claim
time I-claim
away I-claim
from I-claim
your I-claim
family I-claim
and I-claim
friends I-claim
but O
it B-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
make I-claim
family I-claim
get I-claim
together I-claim
and I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
in I-claim
conversation I-claim
. O

As O
well O
as O
it B-claim
's I-claim
one I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
recent I-claim
communications I-claim
, O
based O
on O
that O

I O
think O
TV B-claim
helps I-claim
you I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
connected I-claim
with I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Parents O
can O
help O
their O
teenage O
children O
prepare O
for O
adult O
life O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
society O
has O
become O
exceedingly O
competitive O
than O
ever O
before O
, O
parents O
have O
the O
responsibilitis O
to O
teach O
their O
children O
to O
survive O
and O
to O
be O
indepedent O
from O
them O
, O
just O
as O
animals O
teach O
their O
offspring O
skills O
of O
finding O
foods O
. O

Parents O
can O
use O
many O
methods O
to O
guide O
them O
to O
achieve O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
asking O
them O
to O
do O
some O
housework O
or O
clean O
the O
rooms O
by O
themselves O
. O

In O
my O
views O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
teenage I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
their I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when B-premise
children I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
earn I-premise
money I-premise
by I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
getting I-premise
pocket I-premise
money I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
oppertunity I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
deal I-claim
with I-claim
money I-claim
. O

Take O
me O
as O
an O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
16 I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
found I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
during I-premise
summer I-premise
vacation I-premise
and I-premise
earned I-premise
some I-premise
money I-premise
by I-premise
own I-premise
. O

At B-premise
the I-premise
beginning I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
semester I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
told I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
a I-premise
text I-premise
book I-premise
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I B-premise
spent I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
salary I-premise
hanging I-premise
out I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I B-premise
finally I-premise
realized I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
should I-premise
learn I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
plan I-premise
before I-premise
I I-premise
spend I-premise
my I-premise
money I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
that I-premise
did I-premise
influence I-premise
me I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
life I-premise
now I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
by B-claim
taking I-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
certainly I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
responsible I-claim
for I-claim
anything I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
done I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
company I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
frequently I-premise
late I-premise
for I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
company I-premise
may I-premise
reduce I-premise
his I-premise
payment I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
fire I-premise
him I-premise
. O

To B-premise
compare I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
school I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
suffer I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
punishment I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Under B-premise
the I-premise
circumstances I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
will I-premise
learn I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
obey I-premise
the I-premise
rule I-premise
and I-premise
take I-premise
responsibility I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
to B-claim
help I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
adapt I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
parents I-claim
should I-claim
let I-claim
them I-claim
experience I-claim
it I-claim
as I-claim
much I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
. O

Due O
to O
the O
reasons O
given O
above O
, O
to B-claim
encourage I-claim
children I-claim
taking I-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
choice I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
prepared I-claim
for I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Children O
should O
grow O
up O
in O
a O
big O
city O
! O

It B-claim
’s I-claim
certainly I-claim
better I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
grow I-claim
up I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
. O

Of O
course O
you O
need O
to O
choose O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
. O

I B-claim
hold I-claim
this I-claim
belief I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
two I-claim
main I-claim
reasons I-claim
, I-claim
academic I-claim
and I-claim
social I-claim
reasons I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
thinks O
that O
if B-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
grows I-claim
up I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
all I-claim
day I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
computer I-claim
or I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
video I-claim
- I-claim
game I-claim
, O
but O
this B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
true I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
neighborhood I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
about I-premise
your I-premise
age I-premise
as I-premise
I I-premise
did I-premise
. O

My B-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
soccer I-premise
, I-premise
bike I-premise
, I-premise
climb I-premise
trees I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
other I-premise
stuff I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
. O

We B-premise
did I-premise
play I-premise
video I-premise
- I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
that I-premise
was I-premise
n't I-premise
our I-premise
main I-premise
activity I-premise
. O

In B-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
city I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
things I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
. O

I B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
that I-premise
grew I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
countryside I-premise
. O

He B-premise
said I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
to I-premise
pass I-premise
the I-premise
test I-premise
to I-premise
enter I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
. O

This O
is O
another O
downside O
of O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
countryside O
. O

In B-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
qualified I-claim
teachers I-claim
and I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
technology I-claim
. O

Growing B-claim
up I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
countryside I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
such I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
experience I-claim
, O
you B-premise
wo I-premise
n’t I-premise
know I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
gossips I-premise
everywhere I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
your I-premise
life I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
really I-premise
limited I-premise
. O

If O
someday O
I O
have O
children O
, O
I O
’m O
absolutely O
sure O
that O
they B-claim
will I-claim
grow I-claim
up I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
neighborhood I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
very I-claim
happy I-claim
about I-claim
it I-claim
. O

Parents O
are O
the O
best O
teachers O
because O
they O
are O
more O
special O
than O
everybody O
else O
I O
completely O
agree O
that O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

Children B-claim
normally I-claim
think I-claim
that I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
are I-claim
somehow I-claim
special I-claim
and I-claim
that I-claim
makes I-claim
them I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
children I-claim
’s I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-claim
things I-claim
that I-claim
parents I-claim
say I-claim
have I-claim
great I-claim
power I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
child I-claim
. O

More B-premise
power I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
friend I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
adult I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
someone I-premise
tells I-premise
a I-premise
kid I-premise
that I-premise
something I-premise
is I-premise
wrong I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
should I-premise
n't I-premise
do I-premise
it I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
his I-premise
father I-premise
told I-premise
him I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
right I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
kid I-premise
will I-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
father I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
person I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
if I-premise
his I-premise
father I-premise
is I-premise
wrong I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
a B-premise
child I-premise
normally I-premise
spends I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
than I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
, O
so O
their B-claim
parents I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
teach I-claim
him I-claim
/ I-claim
her I-claim
than I-claim
anybody I-claim
else I-claim
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
contact I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
intimacy I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
children B-claim
usually I-claim
mirror I-claim
themselves I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

That O
’s O
as O
important O
thing O
because O
even B-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
parents I-premise
do I-premise
n’t I-premise
intend I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
something I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
observing I-premise
and I-premise
learning I-premise
by I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

So O
, O
if B-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
man I-premise
that I-premise
beats I-premise
his I-premise
wife I-premise
and I-premise
treats I-premise
her I-premise
bad I-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
child I-premise
probably I-premise
is I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
rude I-premise
and I-premise
treat I-premise
girls I-premise
bad I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
greatest I-claim
teachers I-claim
and O
I O
think O
that O
they O
should O
be O
very O
careful O
with O
what O
they O
say O
and O
do O
in O
front O
of O
their O
child O
, O
because O
it O
can O
define O
who O
he O
is O
going O
to O
be O
. O

Easy O
preparation O
of O
food O
leads O
to O
a O
better O
life O

The O
Technology O
has O
developed O
a O
lot O
. O

With O
that O
development O
, O
food O
can O
be O
prepared O
more O
easily O
and O
it O
can O
taste O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
. O

With O
that O
change O
, O
people O
’s O
lives O
are O
a O
lot O
better O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Some O
good O
reasons O
are O
about O
having O
more O
time O
and O
being O
able O
to O
prepare O
better O
food O
without O
being O
a O
good O
cook O
. O

Firstly O
, O
people B-premise
normally I-premise
have I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
things I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
they B-premise
do I-premise
n’t I-premise
have I-premise
much I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
kitchen I-premise
. O

But O
being B-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
a I-claim
tasty I-claim
food I-claim
just I-claim
putting I-claim
it I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
microwave I-claim
or I-claim
into I-claim
the I-claim
oven I-claim
is I-claim
awesome I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
an I-premise
engineer I-premise
needs I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
project I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
needs I-premise
to I-premise
deliver I-premise
it I-premise
tomorrow I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
could I-premise
save I-premise
hours I-premise
preparing I-premise
a I-premise
food I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
microwave I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
cooking I-premise
everything I-premise
from I-premise
scratch I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
when B-claim
someone I-claim
wants I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
food I-claim
alone I-claim
for I-claim
some I-claim
reason I-claim
, I-claim
some I-claim
time I-claim
ago I-claim
he I-claim
/ I-claim
she I-claim
would I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
good I-claim
cook I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
that I-claim
food I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
nowadays I-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
a I-claim
healthy I-claim
and I-claim
tasty I-claim
food I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
guy I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
a I-premise
dinner I-premise
to I-premise
his I-premise
girlfriend I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
could I-premise
just I-premise
buy I-premise
some I-premise
food I-premise
that I-premise
comes I-premise
with I-premise
instructions I-premise
. O

Normally B-premise
you I-premise
just I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
put I-premise
it I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
oven I-premise
and I-premise
wait I-premise
some I-premise
time I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
that O
ease B-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
food I-claim
has I-claim
improved I-claim
people I-claim
’s I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

And O
that O
happened O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
technology O
. O

But B-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
careful I-claim
with I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
eat I-claim
, O
because O
some B-premise
industrial I-premise
foods I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
bad I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
health I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
should I-premise
buy I-premise
only I-premise
food I-premise
from I-premise
well I-premise
known I-premise
brands I-premise
. O

Should O
University O
education O
be O
free O
for O
everyone O
interested O
? O

A O
famous O
proverb O

“ O
Knowledge O
is O
power O
” O
has O
demonstrated O
the O
value O
of O
education O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
universities B-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
free I-claim
of I-claim
cost I-claim
education I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
interested I-claim
scholars I-claim
because O
now B-claim
- I-claim
a I-claim
- I-claim
days I-claim
universities I-claim
with I-claim
good I-claim
name I-claim
charge I-claim
high I-claim
fees I-claim
and I-claim
this I-claim
leads I-claim
one I-claim
to I-claim
think I-claim
about I-claim
affordability I-claim
. O

I O
have O
observed O
that O
many B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
interested I-premise
scholars I-premise
failed I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
admission I-premise
in I-premise
good I-premise
universities I-premise
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
about I-premise
work I-premise
along I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
studies I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
left I-premise
them I-premise
with I-premise
only I-premise
one I-premise
choice I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
work I-premise
. O

University B-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
money I-premise
making I-premise
business I-premise
, O
the B-claim
issue I-claim
of I-claim
affordability I-claim
has I-claim
become I-claim
crucial I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
. O

In B-premise
today I-premise
’s I-premise
world I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
getting I-premise
expensive I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
tending I-premise
to I-premise
apply I-premise
for I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
finance I-premise
education I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
admission I-premise
. O

Whereas O
, O
the B-premise
scholars I-premise
are I-premise
facing I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
difficulties I-premise
apart I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
high I-premise
requirements I-premise
of I-premise
previous I-premise
education I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
difficulties I-premise
and I-premise
burden I-premise
while I-premise
getting I-premise
admission I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
accommodation I-premise
, I-premise
food I-premise
, I-premise
traveling I-premise
, I-premise
clothing I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
manage I-premise
two I-premise
things I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
, I-premise
working I-premise
and I-premise
studying I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
an I-premise
easy I-premise
job I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
scholars I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
concentrate I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
. O

MPhils B-premise
and I-premise
PhDs I-premise
scholars I-premise
are I-premise
probably I-premise
engage I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
research I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
takes I-premise
their I-premise
full I-premise
concentration I-premise
and I-premise
surveys I-premise
. O

The B-claim
idea I-claim
of I-claim
free I-claim
of I-claim
charge I-claim
education I-claim
inspires I-claim
those I-claim
scholars I-claim
who I-claim
really I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
put I-claim
their I-claim
efforts I-claim
and I-claim
get I-claim
a I-claim
degree I-claim
from I-claim
best I-claim
universities I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
universities B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
look I-claim
over I-claim
the I-claim
issues I-claim
face I-claim
by I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
scholars I-claim
; I-claim
their I-claim
message I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
spread I-claim
education I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
making I-claim
money I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
motivate I-claim
those I-claim
scholars I-claim
who I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
education I-claim
. O

Their O
notion O
should O
be O
inspirational O
in O
such O
a O
way O
which O
makes O
our O
society O
educative O
and O
increase O
our O
literacy O
rate O
. O

Should O
professors O
doing O
more O
research O
or O
educating O
students O
more O
? O

Although O
professors O
in O
a O
university O
are O
basically O
teachers O
who O
do O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
, O
teaching O
, O
we O
can O
not O
ignore O
one O
more O
influential O
aspect O
that O
they O
are O
always O
busy O
with O
, O
doing O
research O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
a B-claim
professor I-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
doing I-claim
research I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
educating I-claim
students I-claim
for O
a O
few O
reasons O
following O
. O

A B-premise
professor I-premise
means I-premise
a I-premise
researcher I-premise
or I-premise
an I-premise
expert I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
specific I-premise
science I-premise
subject I-premise
. O

He B-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
should I-premise
always I-premise
keep I-premise
the I-premise
passion I-premise
in I-premise
her I-premise
field I-premise
so O
that O
he B-claim
or I-claim
she I-claim
could I-claim
push I-claim
him I-claim
/ I-claim
herself I-claim
forward I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
. O

And O
then O
he B-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
better I-premise
in I-premise
teaching I-premise
works I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
most I-premise
impressive I-premise
professor I-premise
during I-premise
my I-premise
studying I-premise
in I-premise
university I-premise
is I-premise
Mr. I-premise
Yang I-premise
who I-premise
keeps I-premise
in I-premise
researching I-premise
and I-premise
reading I-premise
. O

He B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
the I-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
gave I-premise
us I-premise
inspiration I-premise
and I-premise
taught I-premise
us I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
more I-premise
efficient I-premise
by I-premise
ourselves I-premise
. O

All B-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
classmates I-premise
gave I-premise
him I-premise
a I-premise
rank I-premise
of I-premise
AAA I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
excellent I-premise
teacher I-premise
. O

As B-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
what I-premise
we I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
from I-premise
textbooks I-premise
, I-premise
webs I-premise
or I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

But O
we B-premise
can I-premise
only I-premise
turn I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
professors I-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
research I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
ourselves I-premise
promoted I-premise
. O

If B-claim
a I-claim
professor I-claim
does I-claim
n't I-claim
get I-claim
any I-claim
researching I-claim
works I-claim
, I-claim
he I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
give I-claim
us I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-claim
professor I-claim
who I-claim
is I-claim
concentrate I-claim
in I-claim
his I-claim
or I-claim
her I-claim
research I-claim
is I-claim
thinking I-claim
and I-claim
creating I-claim
new I-claim
ideas I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
. O

He B-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
may I-premise
stimulate I-premise
us I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
come I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
some I-premise
creative I-premise
sugesstions I-premise
. O

That B-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
for I-premise
both I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
professor I-premise
and I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
all B-premise
professors I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
are I-premise
fortune I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
leaders I-premise
almost I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
fields I-premise
of I-premise
science I-premise
, I-premise
arts I-premise
, I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
. O

Without B-claim
their I-claim
research I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
no I-claim
new I-claim
technologies I-claim
come I-claim
out I-claim
quickly I-claim
. O

Without B-premise
their I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
artcrafts I-premise
being I-premise
ruined I-premise
by I-premise
nothing I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
their I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
less I-premise
information I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
ancestors I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
known I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
earth I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
professor I-claim
should I-claim
do I-claim
their I-claim
research I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
during I-claim
their I-claim
careers I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
in I-claim
university I-claim
. O

And O
it O
's O
worth O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
it O
than O
on O
teaching O
. O

Television O
and O
Movies O
influence O
our O
lives O
both O
negatively O
and O
positively O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
television O
or O
movies O
influence O
people O
’s O
behavior O
and O
they O
influence O
us O
in O
both O
bad O
ways O
and O
good O
ways O
. O

But O
I O
think O
in B-claim
general I-claim
television I-claim
and I-claim
movies I-claim
influence I-claim
our I-claim
behavior I-claim
in I-claim
bad I-claim
ways I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
good I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

They B-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
eat I-claim
more I-claim
rubbish I-claim
food I-claim
, I-claim
spend I-claim
less I-claim
time I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
family I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
be I-claim
someone I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
themselves I-claim
. O

There B-claim
are I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
eating I-claim
foods I-claim
or I-claim
snacks I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise

that I-premise
these I-premise
foods I-premise

Many B-premise
companies I-premise
know I-premise
about I-premise
this I-premise
behavior I-premise

use I-premise
advertisements I-premise
on I-premise
television I-premise

make I-premise
people I-premise
buy I-premise
more I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise

In B-premise
turn I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
consume I-premise
these I-premise
rubbish I-premise
foods I-premise
more I-premise

we I-premise
have I-premise

a I-premise

Television B-claim

movies I-claim
also I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
couch I-claim

with I-claim
their I-claim
family I-claim

, I-claim
especially I-claim
children I-claim
. O

They B-premise
communicate I-premise
less I-premise

a B-premise

their I-premise
time I-premise

used I-premise
watching I-premise
television I-premise

movies I-premise

When B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
watching I-premise

movies I-premise
together I-premise

they I-premise
also I-premise

such I-premise
as I-premise

together I-premise
. O

Television O
and O
movies O
nowadays O
contain O
a O
lot O
of O
advertisements O
. O

These B-claim
advertisements I-claim
build I-claim
ideal I-claim
images I-claim
that I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
feel I-claim
bad I-claim
about I-claim
themselves I-claim

want I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim

these I-claim
images I-claim

When B-premise
people I-premise
see I-premise
beautiful I-premise
women I-premise

men I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
advertisements I-premise

they I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
ugly I-premise

Thus O
they B-premise
spend I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise

money I-premise

buy I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
beauty I-premise

go I-premise

When B-premise
a I-premise

yet I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise

people I-premise
like I-premise
him I-premise

then I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
idolize I-premise
him I-premise

also I-premise
begin I-premise

although I-premise
they I-premise

prefer I-premise
it I-premise

I O
think O
television B-claim

entertaining I-claim

most B-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
they I-claim

in I-claim
bad I-claim

I B-claim
personaly I-claim

to I-claim
visit I-claim
museums I-claim
when I-claim
I I-claim
'm I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim

history I-claim

The O
first O
reason O
why O
people O
are O
willing O
to O
visit O
museums O
when O
they O
travel O
to O
a O
new O
territory O
is O
that O
museums B-claim
provide I-claim
a I-claim
tremendous I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
about I-claim
different I-claim
aspects I-claim

And B-premise
also I-premise
taking I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise

Visit B-premise
museums I-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
you I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise

establish I-premise
relations I-premise

knowledge I-premise

And B-premise
that I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
speaks I-premise
very I-premise
highly I-premise
of I-premise
you I-premise
. O

However O
, O
other B-claim
people I-claim
visit I-claim
museums I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
boring I-claim
expirience I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
trip I-claim
. O

My B-premise
cousin I-premise
Pedro I-premise
literaly I-premise
hates I-premise
to I-premise
visit I-premise
museums I-premise

he I-premise
really I-premise
enjoyed I-premise
his I-premise
visit I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
famous I-premise
London I-premise

Madame I-premise

museum I-premise

it I-premise
was I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
entertainment I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
that I-premise
visit I-premise
helped I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
the I-premise
artist I-premise
works I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
addition I-premise
he I-premise
started I-premise

respect I-premise

admire I-premise
other I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
arts I-premise
that I-premise
offers I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
museums I-premise

In O
coclusion O
, O
the B-claim
museums I-claim
are I-claim
a I-claim
visual I-claim
source I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
the I-claim
history I-claim

tradition I-claim

culture I-claim
of I-claim
any I-claim
place I-claim

the I-claim

I O

it B-claim

fun I-claim

educational I-claim

A O
man O

Once O
a O
celebrity O
said O
: O
A O
man O
's O
manner O
is O
a O
mirror O
that O
reflects O
his O
virtues O
. O

Recently O
, O
the O
social O
environment O
we O
lived O
with O
busy O
noises O
and O
crowded O
spaces O
in O
case O
that O
people O
pay O
less O
attentions O
on O
their O
behaviors O
and O
manners O
. O

They O
are O
being O
rude O
towards O
others O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
phenomenon O
, O
someone O
suggests O
that O
we O
should O
not O
expect O
people O
to O
be O
polite O
to O
other O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
such O
kind O
of O
altitudes O
, O
the O
explanations O
I O
explored O
would O
be O
stated O
as O
following O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a B-claim
person I-claim
with I-claim
good I-claim
manner I-claim
will I-claim
give I-claim
others I-claim
a I-claim
fine I-claim
personal I-claim
impression I-claim
. O

Through B-premise
those I-premise
impressions I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
was I-premise
easily I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
acquired I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
and I-premise
blended I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
community I-premise
that I-premise
surrounded I-premise
him I-premise
as I-premise
soon I-premise
as I-premise
possible I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
worked I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
company I-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
a I-premise
guy I-premise
with I-premise
good I-premise
manners I-premise
and I-premise
treating I-premise
everyone I-premise
well I-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
new I-premise
colleagues I-premise
will I-premise
accept I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
then I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
approved I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
employers I-premise
. O

In B-premise
opposite I-premise
situation I-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
being I-premise
rude I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
get I-premise
along I-premise
well I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
I B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
fired I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
other I-premise
choice I-premise
but I-premise
lost I-premise
my I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
people B-claim
will I-claim
get I-claim
respect I-claim
from I-claim
politeness I-claim
within I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

Politeness B-premise
and I-premise
tender I-premise
words I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
the I-premise
speaker I-premise
to I-premise
earn I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
reputation I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
that I-premise
encourage I-premise
the I-premise
listeners I-premise
who I-premise
were I-premise
in I-premise
need I-premise
. O

A B-premise
successful I-premise
corporation I-premise
must I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
relationship I-premise
with I-premise
respect I-premise
and I-premise
pleasure I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
more I-premise
facts I-premise
have I-premise
improved I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
politeness I-premise
are I-premise
easily I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
succeed I-premise
, O
because O
from B-premise
their I-premise
behaviors I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
made I-premise
their I-premise
partners I-premise
or I-premise
opponents I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
individual I-premise
dignity I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
the B-claim
society I-claim
needs I-claim
a I-claim
civilized I-claim
environment I-claim
and I-claim
orders I-claim
. O

And O
a B-premise
degree I-premise
of I-premise
social I-premise
civilization I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
its I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
qualities I-premise
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
living I-premise
environment I-premise
for I-premise
ourselves I-premise
and I-premise
our I-premise
offsprings I-premise
, I-premise
our I-premise
behaviors I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
asked I-premise
with I-premise
politeness I-premise
and I-premise
good I-premise
manners I-premise
. O

Benefit B-premise
from I-premise
those I-premise
effective I-premise
measures I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
an I-premise
obvious I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
reducing I-premise
of I-premise
criminal I-premise
rate I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
suppose O
that O
people B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
polite I-claim
to I-claim
others I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
such I-claim
busy I-claim
and I-claim
crowded I-claim
world I-claim
. O

Your O
job O
has O
more O
effect O
on O
your O
happiness O
than O
your O
living O
environment O
does O
With O
the O
development O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
people O
become O
more O
and O
more O
rich O
. O

They O
start O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
mental O
requirement O
like O
happiness O
. O

While O
I O
accept O
that O
job O
can O
offer O
happiness O
to O
some O
people O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living B-claim
environment I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
than I-claim
job I-claim
for I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
us I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
job B-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
us I-claim
happiness I-claim
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
receive I-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
values I-premise
and I-premise
respected I-premise
from I-premise
job I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
receive I-premise
respect I-premise
from I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
achievement I-premise
and I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
confidence I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
job B-claim
can I-claim
provide I-claim
money I-claim
to I-claim
us I-claim
. O

However O
, O
people B-claim
should I-claim
concern I-claim
more I-claim
about I-claim
their I-claim
living I-claim
environment I-claim
than I-claim
job I-claim
. O

First O
, O
for B-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
us I-premise
, I-premise
job I-premise
is I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
tool I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
our I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

Few B-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
feel I-premise
happiness I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
continue I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
30 I-premise
years I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Workers B-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
FOXCONN I-premise
factory I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
main I-premise
manufacture I-premise
of I-premise
APPLE I-premise
Company I-premise
, I-premise
just I-premise
repeat I-premise
one I-premise
action I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
8 I-premise
hours I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
. O

These B-premise
labor I-premise
works I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
provide I-premise
workers I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
happiness I-premise
because O
they B-premise
feel I-premise
tired I-premise
and I-premise
frustrated I-premise
after I-premise
long I-premise
hour I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
beautiful B-claim
environment I-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
basic I-claim
physiological I-claim
needs I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
fundamental I-claim
requirements I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Without B-premise
beautiful I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
feel I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
will I-premise
fell I-premise
anxiety I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
fast I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
economy I-premise
is I-premise
gradually I-premise
destroying I-premise
our I-premise
environment I-premise
very I-premise
quickly I-premise
. O

Factories B-premise
released I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
wasters I-premise
into I-premise
river I-premise
and I-premise
soil I-premise
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
build I-premise
city I-premise
and I-premise
factory I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
destroy I-premise
huge I-premise
forests I-premise
. O

In B-premise
China I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
residents I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
nearby I-premise
some I-premise
toxic I-premise
factories I-premise
became I-premise
sick I-premise
because O
these B-premise
factories I-premise
release I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
toxic I-premise
water I-premise
and I-premise
wasters I-premise
into I-premise
environment I-premise
around I-premise
people I-premise
. O

Even O
though O
local B-premise
residents I-premise
benefits I-premise
from I-premise
an I-premise
increasing I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
jobs I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
provided I-premise
by I-premise
those I-premise
factories I-premise
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
feel I-premise
happiness I-premise
from I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
paying I-premise
job I-premise
yet O
because O
most B-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
cancer I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
diseases I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
far I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
our I-claim
living I-claim
environment I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
job I-claim
or I-claim
work I-claim
since O
the B-claim
goal I-claim
people I-claim
is I-claim
for I-claim
good I-claim
livers I-claim
. O

Television O
has O
more O
bad O
than O
good O
in O
respect O
of O
bonds O
with O
family O
and O
friends O

There O
are O
many O
interesting O
programs O
on O
television O
which O
anyone O
can O
enjoy O
at O
little O
cost O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
hobbies O
such O
as O
going O
to O
theater O
or O
going O
to O
sports O
stadium O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
cost O
- O
effective O
hobby O
that O
gives O
viewer O
quiet O
a O
few O
indirect O
experiences O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
television B-claim
has I-claim
more I-claim
bad I-claim
than I-claim
good I-claim
because O
it B-claim
has I-claim
made I-claim
people I-claim
not I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
conversation I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
television B-claim
shows I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
forget I-claim
what I-claim
is I-claim
really I-claim
important I-claim
. O

One B-premise
who I-premise
has I-premise
favorite I-premise
programs I-premise
tends I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
obessed I-premise
with I-premise
them I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
on I-premise
air I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
make I-premise
appointment I-premise
or I-premise
go I-premise
out I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
or I-premise
friends I-premise
at I-premise
that I-premise
time I-premise
since O
they B-premise
think I-premise
the I-premise
programs I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
crucial I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

One B-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
once I-premise
cancelled I-premise
an I-premise
appointment I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
basketball I-premise
with I-premise
in I-premise

This B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
about I-premise
basketball I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
about I-premise
our I-premise
friendship I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
depends I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
often I-premise
we I-premise
meet I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

That O
is O
, O
watching B-premise
television I-premise
alone I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
lost I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
increase I-premise
cohesion I-premise
between I-premise
us I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
even B-claim
when I-claim
people I-claim
watch I-claim
television I-claim
together I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
chance I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
conversation I-claim
in I-claim
front I-claim
of I-claim
television I-claim
. O

Watching B-premise
television I-premise
program I-premise
together I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
that I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
watching I-premise
same I-premise
program I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
good I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
watch I-premise
television I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
closeness I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
my O
point O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
reported I-premise
that I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
converse I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
watching I-premise
television I-premise
together I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
natural I-premise
they I-premise
behave I-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
way I-premise
because O
television B-premise
shows I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
require I-premise
any I-premise
participation I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
detrimental I-claim
to I-claim
communication I-claim
among I-claim
members I-claim
in I-claim
group I-claim
, I-claim
family I-claim
or I-claim
friends I-claim
or I-claim
whatever I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
sit I-claim
in I-claim
front I-claim
of I-claim
television I-claim
and I-claim
just I-claim
stare I-claim
forward I-claim
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
because I-claim
television I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
makes I-claim
people I-claim
be I-claim
obsessed I-claim
with I-claim
it I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
makes I-claim
their I-claim
mouth I-claim
close I-claim
. O

Haste O
makes O
waste O

This O
saying O
is O
stating O
that O
every B-claim
fast I-claim
and I-claim
not I-claim
well I-claim
thought I-claim
decision I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
wasted I-claim
one I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
statement O
is O
completely O
true O
, O
for O
these O
few O
reasons O
: O
For O
one O
thing O
, O
making B-premise
a I-premise
quick I-premise
decision I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
not I-premise
very I-premise
thought I-premise
out I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
has I-premise
n't I-premise
been I-premise
checked I-premise
from I-premise
all I-premise
its I-premise
aspects I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
making B-claim
quick I-claim
decisions I-claim
leads I-claim
to I-claim
probable I-claim
bad I-claim
results I-claim
. O

For O
example O
: O
if B-premise
someone I-premise
decided I-premise
to I-premise
quit I-premise
his I-premise
job I-premise
without I-premise
really I-premise
thinking I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
alternative I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
plan I-premise
B I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
could I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
being I-premise
unemployed I-premise
, I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
speedy I-premise
decision I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
making B-claim
a I-claim
rushed I-claim
decision I-claim
could I-claim
also I-claim
mean I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
person I-claim
is I-claim
missing I-claim
out I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
potential I-claim
opportunity I-claim
. O

In O
another O
word O
, O
if B-premise
this I-premise
person I-premise
had I-premise
waited I-premise
and I-premise
thought I-premise
his I-premise
decision I-premise
through I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
missed I-premise
out I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
job I-premise
opening I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
firm I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
different I-premise
position I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
he B-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
unemployed I-premise
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
that O
hasty B-claim
decisions I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
goes I-claim
to I-claim
waste I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
, I-claim
could I-claim
affect I-claim
the I-claim
entire I-claim
life I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
person I-claim
. O

To B-premise
put I-premise
it I-premise
differently I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
after I-premise
this I-premise
person I-premise
has I-premise
quit I-premise
his I-premise
job I-premise
and I-premise
became I-premise
unemployed I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
no I-premise
longer I-premise
pay I-premise
his I-premise
bills I-premise
nor I-premise
buy I-premise
what I-premise
he I-premise
needs I-premise
for I-premise
his I-premise
everyday I-premise
needs I-premise
, O
thus O
, O
his B-premise
life I-premise
had I-premise
taken I-premise
a I-premise
turn I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
worst I-premise
. O

As O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
this O
, O
is O
that O
a B-claim
hurried I-claim
decision I-claim
is I-claim
almost I-claim
never I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
one I-claim
. O

That O
's O
why O
one O
should O
always O
study O
his O
decision O
carefully O
and O
slowly O
, O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
decision O
that O
the O
person O
is O
making O
is O
the O
best O
for O
him O
. O

People O
are O
now O
able O
to O
overcome O
long O
distances O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time O

Nowadays O
the O
automobile O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
forms O
of O
transportation O
in O
everyday O
life O
. O

Many O
people O
own O
cars O
and O
use O
them O
daily O
, O
which O
clearly O
shows O
how O
important O
they O
are O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
I O
definitely O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
cars B-claim
have I-claim
improved I-claim
modern I-claim
life I-claim
, O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
people B-premise
are I-premise
now I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
overcome I-premise
long I-premise
distances I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
numerous I-premise
advantages I-premise
. O

For O
example O
in O
relationships O
. O

Many B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
now I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
maintain I-claim
relationships I-claim
over I-claim
great I-claim
distances I-claim
because O
they B-premise
can I-premise
visit I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
regularly I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
their I-premise
vehicle I-premise
. O

From O
my O
personal O
experience O
I O
recall O
that O
my B-premise
car I-premise
has I-premise
always I-premise
been I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
my I-premise
childhood I-premise
friends I-premise
very I-premise
often I-premise
although I-premise
I I-premise
lived I-premise
in I-premise
another I-premise
city I-premise
. O

I B-premise
was I-premise
also I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
establish I-premise
a I-premise
relationship I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
man I-premise
living I-premise
89 I-premise
kilometers I-premise
away I-premise
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
car I-premise
we I-premise
could I-premise
see I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
weekends I-premise
and I-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
a I-premise
happy I-premise
couple I-premise
today I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
my I-premise
automobile I-premise
we I-premise
would I-premise
probably I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
a I-premise
relationship I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
cars B-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
chance I-claim
of I-claim
employment I-claim
because O
people B-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
drive I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
further I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
home I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
flexible I-premise
. O

My B-premise
father I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
has I-premise
always I-premise
been I-premise
working I-premise
all I-premise
around I-premise
Germany I-premise
and I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
earned I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
. O

He B-premise
used I-premise
his I-premise
car I-premise
to I-premise
drive I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
worked I-premise
there I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
week I-premise
and I-premise
came I-premise
home I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
weekend I-premise
. O

If B-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
no I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
his I-premise
family I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
weekends I-premise
so I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
his I-premise
automobile I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
benefit I-premise
- I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
financial I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
in I-premise
social I-premise
terms I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
the B-premise
automobile I-premise
allows I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
more I-premise
often I-premise
and I-premise
thus I-premise
get I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
own I-premise
cars I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
stay I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
hometown I-premise
or I-premise
village I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
mainly I-premise
using I-premise
public I-premise
transport I-premise
and I-premise
are I-premise
thus I-premise
limited I-premise
in I-premise
accessing I-premise
certain I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
places I-premise
in I-premise
nearly I-premise
every I-premise
country I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
reached I-premise
by I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
only I-premise
be I-premise
visited I-premise
by I-premise
car I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
own I-claim
a I-claim
vehicle I-claim
have I-claim
greater I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
more I-claim
places I-claim
and I-claim
will I-claim
see I-claim
more I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
above O
stated O
reasons O
clearly O
outweigh O
the O
fact O
that O
cars B-claim
cause I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
pollution I-claim
because O
they B-premise
provide I-premise
flexibility I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
important I-premise
in I-premise
nearly I-premise
all I-premise
areas I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Travelling B-claim
, I-claim
social I-claim
life I-claim
and I-claim
employment I-claim
are I-claim
highly I-claim
dependent I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
flexibility I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
and I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
nothing I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
that I-claim
makes I-claim
more I-claim
flexible I-claim
than I-claim
an I-claim
own I-claim
car I-claim
. O

Choosing O
the O
job O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
parents O
' O
jobs O
could O
benefit O
to O
one O
's O
career O

When O
choosing O
a O
job O
, O
one O
need O
to O
consider O
it O
thoroughly O
. O

Whether O
to O
choose O
a O
job O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
parents O
' O
job O
or O
not O
, O
different O
people O
may O
hold O
different O
opinions O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
think O
choosing B-claim
the I-claim
job I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
similar I-claim
to I-claim
parents I-claim
' I-claim
jobs I-claim
could I-claim
benefit I-claim
to I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
career I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as B-premise
parents I-premise
are I-premise
involved I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
environment O
, O
they B-claim
could I-claim
thus I-claim
support I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
domain I-claim
knowledge I-claim
and I-claim
industry I-claim
- I-claim
related I-claim
information I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
father I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
software I-premise
programmer I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
he I-premise
indeed I-premise
teaches I-premise
me I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
in I-premise
programming I-premise
and I-premise
some I-premise
computer I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Whenever B-premise
I I-premise
met I-premise
a I-premise
difficulty I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
reach I-premise
him I-premise
for I-premise
consulting I-premise
. O

Because O
he B-premise
has I-premise
many I-premise
experiences I-premise
, O
I B-premise
could I-premise
save I-premise
enormous I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
finding I-premise
solution I-premise
. O

This B-premise
truly I-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
more I-premise
competitive I-premise
than I-premise
my I-premise
colleagues I-premise
. O

If B-premise
I I-premise
worked I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
different I-premise
field I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
father I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
have I-premise
faced I-premise
much I-premise
difficulty I-premise
than I-premise
I I-premise
do I-premise
now I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
since O
parents B-premise
have I-premise
worked I-premise
in I-premise
tens I-premise
of I-premise
years I-premise
, O
they B-premise
have I-premise
accumulated I-premise
a I-premise
rich I-premise
network I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
industry I-premise
. O

They B-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
deep I-claim
insight I-claim
in I-claim
it I-claim
and I-claim
could I-claim
provide I-claim
much I-claim
support I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
they B-premise
know I-premise
which I-premise
company I-premise
has I-premise
better I-premise
welfare I-premise
or I-premise
provides I-premise
better I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
their B-premise
friends I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
industry I-premise
can I-premise
even I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
write I-premise
recommendation I-premise
letters I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
certain I-premise
companies I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
undoubted I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
recommendation I-premise
letter I-premise
is I-premise
extraordinary I-premise
important I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
competitive I-premise
society I-premise
. O

When B-premise
others I-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
struggling I-premise
in I-premise
preparing I-premise
their I-premise
resume I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
recommendation I-premise
letter I-premise
has I-premise
already I-premise
passed I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
stage I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
interviewing I-premise
process I-premise
. O

Some O
may O
argue O
that O
as O
time O
is O
different O
, O
the B-premise
condition I-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
market I-premise
is I-premise
completely I-premise
different I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
choosing B-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
similar I-claim
to I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
parents I-claim
' I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
always I-claim
a I-claim
correct I-claim
decision I-claim
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
but O
when B-premise
it I-premise
comes I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
trend I-premise
, I-premise
no I-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
predict I-premise
it I-premise
correctly I-premise
. O

The B-premise
condition I-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
market I-premise
changes I-premise
enormously I-premise
fast I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
flash I-premise
, O
so O
that O
there B-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
predict I-premise
any I-premise
job I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
popular I-premise
for I-premise
30 I-premise
years I-premise
or I-premise
more I-premise
. O

In O
considering O
whether O
one O
should O
choose O
a O
job O
similar O
to O
his O
or O
her O
parents O
' O
, O
I O
have O
mentioned O
a O
few O
reasons O
that O
one B-claim
can I-claim
get I-claim
more I-claim
support I-claim
from I-claim
his I-claim
or I-claim
her I-claim
parents I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
industry I-claim
. O

I O
believe O
parents B-claim
can I-claim
lead I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
smooth I-claim
career I-claim
path I-claim
. O

Should O
parents O
limit O
their O
children O
watching O
TV O
to O
make O
them O
do O
well O
in O
school O
? O

In O
19th O
century O
, O
television O
is O
one O
of O
an O
significant O
inventions O
and O
has O
become O
a O
indispensible O
appliance O
in O
every O
house O
. O

For O
its O
accessible O
and O
containing O
fancy O
programs O
, O
television O
attracts O
audiences O
from O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
age O
and O
background O
. O

Children O
, O
who O
are O
addicted O
to O
TV O

causes O
broad O
argument O

whether O

in O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
forbidden I-claim
in I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
or I-claim
movies I-claim
excessively I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
children B-premise
generally I-premise
have I-premise
weak I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
control I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
thus I-premise
they I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

Watching B-claim
TV I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
long I-claim
time I-claim
without I-claim
doing I-claim
homework I-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
major I-claim
headaches I-claim
that I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
children I-claim
have I-claim
brought I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

I O
, O
in O
my O
childhood O
, O
was O
just O
a O
typical O
case O
. O

Whenever B-premise
I I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
home I-premise
from I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
thing I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
do I-premise
is I-premise
turning I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
television I-premise
and I-premise
sit I-premise
there I-premise
for I-premise
hours I-premise
. O

I B-premise
could I-premise
watch I-premise
TV I-premise
for I-premise
hours I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
hardly I-premise
sit I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
desk I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
homework I-premise
for I-premise
few I-premise
minutes I-premise
. O

I B-premise
could I-premise
memorize I-premise
all I-premise
channels I-premise
that I-premise
TV I-premise
programs I-premise
was I-premise
playing I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
barely I-premise
memorize I-premise
any I-premise
word I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
textbook I-premise
. O

I B-premise
, I-premise
therefore I-premise
, I-premise
did I-premise
extremely I-premise
bad I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
studying I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
sometimes B-premise
programs I-premise
on I-premise
TV I-premise
are I-premise
full I-premise
of I-premise
violence I-premise
and I-premise
sex I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
harmful I-premise
to I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Children B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
mature I-premise
enough I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
judgment I-premise
of I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
or I-premise
bad I-premise
, O
therefore O
they B-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
imitate I-premise
the I-premise
behaviors I-premise
on I-premise
TV I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
curiosity I-premise
. O

Recently B-premise
, I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
children I-premise
smoke I-premise
because O
they B-premise
imitate I-premise
actors I-premise
' I-premise
behaviors I-premise
on I-premise
TV I-premise
or I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

What O
's O
even O
worse O
, O
according B-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
statistics I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
children I-premise
have I-premise
violent I-premise
tendency I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
reports I-premise
attribute I-premise
this I-premise
to I-premise
TV I-premise
programs I-premise
and I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
programs I-claim
on I-claim
TV I-claim
or I-claim
movies I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
harmful I-claim
to I-claim
children I-claim
in I-claim
metal I-claim
and I-claim
physical I-claim
health I-claim
. O

How O
can O
anyone O
expect O
children O
could O
do O
well O
at O
school O
if O
they O
have O
those O
abnormal O
behaviors O
? O

Admittedly O
, O
in O
concerning O
the O
social O
relationship O
with O
peers O
, O
some O
may O
support O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
watch I-claim
TV I-claim
and I-claim
movies I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
rich I-claim
contents I-claim
that I-claim
could I-claim
give I-claim
children I-claim
some I-claim
topics I-claim
in I-claim
conversation I-claim
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
viewpoint O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
mean I-premise
that I-premise
children I-premise
should I-premise
do I-premise
it I-premise
overtime I-premise
and I-premise
without I-premise
being I-premise
taken I-premise
care I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
watching I-premise
. O

In B-claim
considering I-claim
whether I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
children I-claim
watching I-claim
on I-claim
TV I-claim
or I-claim
movies I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
constrained I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
hold I-claim
a I-claim
strongly I-claim
positive I-claim
point I-claim
of I-claim
view I-claim
toward I-claim
this I-claim
issue I-claim
. O

Because O
children B-claim
are I-claim
poor I-claim
at I-claim
time I-claim
management I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
are I-claim
less I-claim
mature I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
judgment I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
too I-claim
serious I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
taken I-claim
care I-claim
when I-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
and I-claim
movies I-claim
. O

Should O
we O
pay O
professional O
athletes O
( O
entertainers O
) O
a O
high O
salary O
? O

Professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
earn O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
money O
that O
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
people O
spending O
their O
whole O
life O
can O
never O
achieve O
this O
. O

This O
salary O
gap O
between O
those O
famous O
people O
and O
us O
leads O
to O
a O
question O
- O
do O
those O
professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
deserve O
this O
money O
? O

From O
my O
prospect O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
they B-claim
do I-claim
deserve I-claim
this I-claim
high I-claim
payment I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a B-premise
worker I-premise
's I-premise
salary I-premise
can I-premise
properly I-premise
reflect I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
competence I-premise
and I-premise
value I-premise
on I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
career I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
those B-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
paid I-claim
high I-claim
salaries I-claim
must I-claim
exceed I-claim
others I-claim
and I-claim
achieve I-claim
something I-claim
incredible I-claim
in I-claim
certain I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
paid I-premise
for I-premise
no I-premise
reason I-premise
. O

As B-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
now I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
competent I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
must I-premise
show I-premise
ourselves I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
great I-premise
enough I-premise
so I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
convince I-premise
the I-premise
employer I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
deserve I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
payment I-premise
. O

It B-premise
's I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
profession I-premise
. O

That O
's O
why O
the B-premise
richest I-premise
athletes I-premise
usually I-premise
correspond I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
greatest I-premise
athletes I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
fields I-premise
, I-premise
namely I-premise
Michael I-premise
Jordan I-premise
or I-premise
Tiger I-premise
Woods I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
such B-claim
high I-claim
salaries I-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
guarantee I-claim
and I-claim
support I-claim
the I-claim
athlete I-claim
's I-claim
great I-claim
performances I-claim
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
us I-premise
only I-premise
see I-premise
the I-premise
luxurious I-premise
side I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
rich I-premise
athlete I-premise
and I-premise
ignore I-premise
how I-premise
may I-premise
difficulties I-premise
they I-premise
've I-premise
gone I-premise
through I-premise

how I-premise

they I-premise

themselves I-premise

They B-premise
shall I-premise
reap I-premise
within I-premise
their I-premise
high I-premise
salaries I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
paid I-premise
high I-premise
enough I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise

not I-premise
be I-premise
such I-premise
brilliant I-premise
performances I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
amazed I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
the B-claim
gap I-claim
between I-claim
the I-claim
rich I-claim
athletes I-claim
and I-claim
normal I-claim
people I-claim
is I-claim
so I-claim
huge I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
seems I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
unfair I-claim
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
as B-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
everyone I-premise
has I-premise
equal I-premise
chances I-premise
to I-premise
pursue I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
dreams I-premise
and I-premise
careers I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
fair I-premise
. O

Fairness B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
about I-premise
equal I-premise
payments I-premise
for I-premise
everyone I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
equal I-premise
chances I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
goal I-premise
or I-premise
accomplishment I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
high B-claim
salary I-claim
for I-claim
athletes I-claim
is I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
deserve I-claim
in I-claim
accordance I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
achievements I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
a I-claim

It B-claim

a I-claim
positive I-claim

Personally O

I O
agree O

this O
statement O

First O
, O
the B-claim
core I-claim
of I-claim
group I-claim
working I-claim

" I-claim
consensus I-claim

think I-premise

finally I-premise
reach I-premise
an I-premise
agreement I-premise

In O
this O

process O

there O
must O
be O
different O

It B-premise
does I-premise

work I-premise
if I-premise
one I-premise

solely I-premise

on I-premise
his I-premise

her I-premise
idea I-premise
and I-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
take I-premise
other I-premise

the B-premise

not I-premise
a I-premise

every I-premise

's I-premise
duty I-premise

Second O
, O
taking B-premise
criticism I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
virtue I-premise
as I-premise
you I-premise
take I-premise
someone I-premise

Even B-claim
if I-claim
you I-claim

you I-claim
still I-claim
need I-claim

criticism I-claim

Criticism B-premise
definitely I-premise
hurts I-premise
because O
it B-premise
points I-premise
out I-premise
your I-premise
drawbacks I-premise
and I-premise
forces I-premise
you I-premise
to I-premise
confront I-premise
them I-premise

However O
, O
criticism B-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
you I-premise
detect I-premise
those I-premise

fix I-premise
them I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise

Those B-premise
who I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
even I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
word I-premise

criticism I-premise
will I-premise
eventually I-premise

In O
other O

if B-premise
you I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
take I-premise
any I-premise

not I-premise
only I-premise

you I-premise
fail I-premise

other I-premise
people I-premise

also I-premise
get I-premise

As B-premise

Criticism B-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
powerful I-premise
solution I-premise
to I-premise
heal I-premise
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
might O
ask O
: O
what O
if O
the O
criticism O
proves O
to O
be O
wrong O
? O

What O
if O
that O
I O
was O
at O

the O
seemingly O
reasonable O

also O
a O
good O
character O

In O
my O
point O

view O
, O
even B-claim
if I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
right I-claim
, I-claim
criticism I-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
helpful I-claim
because O
in B-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
it I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
fixer I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
it I-premise
also I-premise
serves I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
practice I-premise
to I-premise
test I-premise
you I-premise
how I-premise
much I-premise
you I-premise
know I-premise
about I-premise
your I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Taking B-premise
criticism I-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
necessary I-premise

mean I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
it I-premise
all I-premise
. O

You B-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise

And B-premise
it I-premise

kind I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
criticism I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
criticism B-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
group I-claim
working I-claim
but I-claim
in I-claim
other I-claim
occasions I-claim
we I-claim
still I-claim
need I-claim
criticism I-claim

It O

just O

How O

There O

Some O
people O
believe O

strictly O

the O

will O
be O
more O
convincing O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
second O
idea O
that O
the B-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
teachers I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
students I-claim
more I-claim
interested I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim

explain I-claim
how I-claim

apply I-claim

their I-claim
lives I-claim
outside I-claim

First O
of O
all O

by B-claim
explaining I-claim
how I-claim
the I-claim
subject I-claim
contributes I-claim
to I-claim
daily I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
vivid I-claim
impression I-claim

thus I-claim
become I-claim
more I-claim

active I-claim

acquiring I-claim
the I-claim

memorizing I-premise
the I-premise

how I-premise

my I-premise

an I-premise
experiment I-premise

later I-premise

This B-premise
type I-premise

more I-premise
fun I-premise

eventually I-premise
the I-premise

I B-premise
connected I-premise

This B-premise

In O
conclusion O

keep I-claim
them I-claim

not O

it B-claim
reinforces I-claim
students I-claim

Environmental O

Environmental O
protection O

be O
the O
biggest O
issues O
in O
the O
21st O
century O

They O
are O
both O
important O
because O
they O
are O
vital O
to O
human O

However O

the O

In O
my O
opinion O

I O
believe O
that O
tackling B-claim
down I-claim
environmental I-claim

of I-claim
the I-claim
first I-claim
priority I-claim
rather I-claim

economic I-claim

. O

The O
following O
are O
reasons O
why O
. O

First O
, O
environmental B-claim
protection I-claim
is I-claim
far I-claim
more I-claim
urgent I-claim
than I-claim
economic I-claim
developments I-claim
. O

All B-premise
the I-premise
living I-premise
creatures I-premise
live I-premise
together I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
mother I-premise
Earth I-premise
and I-premise
she I-premise

the I-premise
only I-premise
one I-premise

Without B-premise
Earth I-premise
, I-premise
whatever I-premise
great I-premise
civil I-premise
constructions I-premise
and I-premise
economic I-premise
achievements I-premise
will I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
vain I-premise
because O
we B-premise
will I-premise
all I-premise
perish I-premise
as I-premise
she I-premise

Just B-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise

all I-premise

a I-premise
whole I-premise

a I-premise
strong I-premise
planet I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
the B-claim
influence I-claim
on I-claim
environmental I-claim
problems I-claim
are I-claim
boarder I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
profound I-claim
than I-claim
economic I-claim
issues I-claim
. O

Environmental B-premise
problems I-premise
are I-premise
global I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
local I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
no I-premise
countries I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
spared I-premise
from I-premise
these I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
global I-premise
warming I-premise

when I-premise
the I-premise
temperature I-premise
increases I-premise

the I-premise
whole I-premise
globe I-premise

affected I-premise
, I-premise
suffering I-premise
the I-premise
hotter I-premise
weather I-premise
together I-premise
. O

The B-premise
melting I-premise
ice I-premise
mountain I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
jeopardizes I-premise
habitats I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
polar I-premise
region I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
its I-premise
effects I-premise

the I-premise
rising I-premise

also I-premise
endangers I-premise
the I-premise

the I-premise
small I-premise

the I-premise
equator I-premise

since O
the B-premise
rising I-premise
sea I-premise
water I-premise
could I-premise
drown I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Environmental B-premise
issues I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
divided I-premise
by I-premise
nationality I-premise
because O
all B-premise
humans I-premise
are I-premise
simply I-premise
entwined I-premise
together I-premise
by I-premise
our I-premise
only I-premise
home I-premise
- I-premise
Earth I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
economic B-claim
issues I-claim
are I-claim
global I-claim
and I-claim
critical I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
thus I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
put I-claim
aside I-claim
. O

They O
may O
say O
that O
if B-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
is I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
bad I-premise
situation I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
revolt I-premise
instantly I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
environmental I-premise
problems I-premise
seem I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
like I-premise
chronic I-premise
diseases I-premise
that I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
burst I-premise
out I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
truth I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
've I-premise
been I-premise
encountering I-premise
so I-premise
many I-premise
sighs I-premise
and I-premise
warnings I-premise
of I-premise
global I-premise
climate I-premise
anomalies I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
environmental I-premise
crisis I-premise
right I-premise
now I-premise
. O

It B-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
unwise I-premise
to I-premise
still I-premise
deny I-premise
the I-premise
truth I-premise
and I-premise
keep I-premise
focusing I-premise
on I-premise
economic I-premise
developments I-premise
and I-premise
unfortunately I-premise
, I-premise
usually I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
developments I-premise
are I-premise
even I-premise
the I-premise
causes I-premise
of I-premise
environmental I-premise
damages I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
environmental B-claim
conservation I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
essential I-claim
than I-claim
economic I-claim
developments I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
aspects I-claim

in O
the O
second O

how O
can O
a O

happily O

Similarly O

how O

University O
students O

In O
university O
education O
, O
students O
are O
given O
much O
independence O
in O
the O
ways O
of O

Some O
students O
still O
rely O
on O
classes O

keep O
up O
with O
the O
courses O
, O
while O
some O
students O
do O
n't O
feel O
the O
need O

attend O

they O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
handle O
the O

These O
different O
ideas O
of O
learning O
methods O
lead O
to O
a O
question O
whether O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
the O
class O
as O
long O
as O
they O
can O
pass O
their O
examinations O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
students B-claim
should I-claim
always I-claim
attend I-claim
class I-claim
no I-claim
matter I-claim
what I-claim
the I-claim
outcome I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
exam I-claim
is I-claim
. O

First O
, O
in B-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
, I-claim
attending I-claim
class I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
effective I-claim
than I-claim
simply I-claim
studying I-claim
alone I-claim
to I-claim
pass I-claim
the I-claim
exams I-claim
. O

Classes B-premise
are I-premise
designed I-premise
diligently I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
professors I-premise
absolutely I-premise
bear I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
than I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Professors B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
equip I-premise
with I-premise
experiences I-premise
, I-premise
knowing I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
guide I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
toward I-premise
their I-premise
academic I-premise
achievements I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
it B-premise
's I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
basic I-premise
responsibility I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Attending B-premise
class I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
persuasive I-premise
way I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
respect I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
professor I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
professors I-premise
grade I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
with I-premise
class I-premise
attendances I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
class B-claim
attendances I-claim
are I-claim
regarded I-claim
as I-claim
critical I-claim
as I-claim
examination I-claim
performances I-claim
. O

Those B-premise
who I-premise
even I-premise
achieve I-premise
high I-premise
scores I-premise
on I-premise
exams I-premise
could I-premise
fail I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
n't I-premise
show I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
if B-claim
students I-claim
already I-claim
understand I-claim
the I-claim
contents I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
class I-claim
enough I-claim
to I-claim
pass I-claim
the I-claim
exams I-claim
or I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
study I-claim
the I-claim
course I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
. O

Why O
wasting O
time O
going O
to O
classes O
? O

Does O
n't O
self O
- O
study O
more O
efficient O
? O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
this B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
rather I-premise
immodest I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
thinking I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
that O
professors B-premise
can I-premise
always I-premise
give I-premise
students I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
students I-premise
themselves I-premise
could I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
experiences I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
qualifications I-premise
as I-premise
professors I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
even B-premise
if I-premise
students I-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
brilliant I-premise
to I-premise
surpass I-premise
their I-premise
professors I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
still I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
with I-premise
professors I-premise
and I-premise
classmates I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
students B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
more I-claim
thoroughly I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
showing I-claim
respect I-claim
for I-claim
professors I-claim
and I-claim
themselves I-claim
through I-claim
attending I-claim
classes I-claim
. O

It B-claim
's I-claim
an I-claim
essential I-claim
learning I-claim
process I-claim
. O

Passing O
the O

is O
not O
the O
terminal O
purpose O
of O
learning O
. O

The O
learning O
process O
itself O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
most O
important O

powerful O
way O
of O
evaluating O
a O
student O
. O

What O
's O
more O
important O
: O
hard O
work O
or O
luck O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
when O
you O

a O
beautiful O

And O
also O
when O
you O

an O

Do O
you O

Of O

Also O
it O

Google O

. O

created O
by O

Howbeit O

some O
people O

that O
luck O

of O
a O

of O

but O
to O
be O
frank O
I O
can O
not O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

I O
would O
explore O
my O
primary O
reasons O
here O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
famous B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
usually I-claim
diligent I-claim
people I-claim
not I-claim
lucky I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Hard B-premise
work I-premise
make I-premise
you I-premise
a I-premise
professional I-premise
man I-premise
/ I-premise
woman I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
powerful I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
job I-premise
. O

I O
mean O
, O
when B-premise
you I-premise
work I-premise
hard I-premise
you I-premise
decrease I-premise
portion I-premise
of I-premise
chance I-premise
in I-premise
your I-premise
success I-premise
. O

For O
example O
in B-premise
football I-premise
game I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
said I-premise
that I-premise
penalty I-premise
- I-premise
kick I-premise
need I-premise
good I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
goal I-premise
. O

Statically B-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
goal I-premise
is I-premise
fifty I-premise
- I-premise
fifty I-premise
. O

But B-premise
I I-premise
think I-premise
Ronaldo I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
goal I-premise
from I-premise
a I-premise
penalty I-premise
- I-premise
kick I-premise
with I-premise
more I-premise
possibility I-premise
than I-premise
me I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
for I-premise
which I-premise
Ronaldo I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
fortune I-premise
than I-premise
me I-premise
. O

Definitely B-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
for I-premise
which I-premise
he I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
practice I-premise
and I-premise
exercise I-premise
than I-premise
me I-premise
. O

He B-premise
do I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
exercise I-premise
in I-premise
football I-premise
field I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
, O
so O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
for I-premise
which I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
luckier I-premise
than I-premise
me I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
we B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
always I-claim
lean I-claim
on I-claim
our I-claim
luck I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
successful I-claim
. O

I B-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
disavow I-premise
the I-premise
role I-premise
of I-premise
luck I-premise
in I-premise
success I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
as I-premise
you I-premise
know I-premise
it I-premise
hardly I-premise
accompany I-premise
us I-premise
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
you B-premise
prepare I-premise
for I-premise
TOEFL I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
multiple I-premise
- I-premise
choice I-premise
test I-premise
which I-premise
has I-premise
four I-premise
option I-premise
to I-premise
choose I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
question I-premise
. O

You B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
prepare I-premise
for I-premise
it I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
study I-premise
and I-premise
Rely I-premise
on I-premise
your I-premise
luck I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
lucky I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
pick I-premise
up I-premise
any I-premise
choice I-premise
by I-premise
chance I-premise
you I-premise
would I-premise
fail I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

Undoubtedly O
it B-premise
is I-premise
wise I-premise
advice I-premise
which I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
hard I-premise
study I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
on I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
you B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
before I-premise
doing I-premise
a I-premise
project I-premise
in I-premise
good I-premise
way I-premise
. O

The B-claim
most I-claim
fortunate I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
word I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
manufacture I-claim
an I-claim

or I-claim
build I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
tower I-claim
just I-claim
by I-claim

. O

These B-premise
plans I-premise
is I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
someone I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
mastered I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Undoubtedly O
such B-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
work I-premise
hard I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
great I-premise
experiences I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
hard I-premise
works I-premise
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
I O
think O
any B-claim
great I-claim
success I-claim
need I-claim
great I-claim
work I-claim
not I-claim
great I-claim
luck I-claim
, O
even O
though O
luck B-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
factor I-claim
in I-claim
reaching I-claim
goal I-claim
but O
its B-premise
impact I-premise
is I-premise
extraneous I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
must I-premise
not I-premise
reckon I-premise
on I-premise
luck I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
plans I-premise
. O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
good O
to O
learn O
with O
a O
teacher O
and O
sometimes O
on O
my O
own O
Different O
people O
prefer O
different O
styles O
of O
learning O
. O

I O
think O
both B-claim
learning I-claim
by I-claim
myself I-claim
and I-claim
learning I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
helpful I-claim
. O

Learning B-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
can I-claim
prevent I-claim
one I-claim
from I-claim
being I-claim
confused I-claim
and I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
rate I-claim
and I-claim
speed I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

Another O
important O
point O
is O
that O
for B-claim
practical I-claim
subjects I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
sometimes B-claim
I I-claim
would I-claim
rather I-claim
learning I-claim
on I-claim
my I-claim
own I-claim
. O

A B-premise
good I-premise
and I-premise
experienced I-premise
teacher I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
me I-premise
learn I-premise
faster I-premise
and I-premise
easier I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
when I-premise
learning I-premise
a I-premise
course I-premise
by I-premise
myself I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
hard I-premise
and I-premise
confusing I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
and I-premise
has I-premise
few I-premise
sources I-premise
available I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
get I-premise
discouraged I-premise
after I-premise
spending I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

In B-premise
this I-premise
situation I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
'll I-premise
look I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
teacher I-premise
and I-premise
request I-premise
for I-premise
help I-premise
from I-premise
him I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
. O

And B-premise
then I-premise
he I-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
will I-premise
teach I-premise
me I-premise
the I-premise
course I-premise
efficiently I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
and O
therefore O
I B-claim
will I-claim
learn I-claim
faster I-claim
and I-claim
better I-claim
and I-claim
wo I-claim
n't I-claim
get I-claim
discouraged I-claim
and I-claim
confused I-claim
. O

There B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
practical I-claim
subjects I-claim
that I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
only I-claim
learn I-claim
them I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
or I-claim
an I-claim
instructor I-claim
. O

For O
example O

if B-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
driving I-premise
a I-premise

It B-premise

almost I-premise

things I-claim
that I-claim
I I-claim
prefer I-claim

them I-claim
without I-claim
a I-claim

I B-premise
wo I-premise

spend I-premise
extra I-premise
money I-premise

a I-premise

In B-premise

In O
sum O

sometimes O
it B-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim

sometimes I-claim
on I-claim
my I-claim

In O
my O
view O

both B-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim

each I-claim

its I-claim

Once O
you O
are O
unique O
enough O
, O
you O
are O
already O
on O
the O
way O
to O
success O

Achieving O
success O
is O
everybody O

goal O
for O
life O
and O
there O
are O
absolutely O
many O
different O
directions O
that O
can O
lead O
people O

Some O
people O

while O
some O
other O
people O
prefer O

different O

Which O
one O
is O
the O
promising O
way O
to O
succeed O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
once B-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
unique I-claim
enough I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
already I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
success I-claim
. O

First O
, O
being B-premise
positively I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
everyone I-premise
else I-premise
usually I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
've I-premise
achieved I-premise
something I-premise
that I-premise
is I-premise
superior I-premise
than I-premise
others I-premise
. O

As B-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
competent I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
like I-premise
playing I-premise
a I-premise
survival I-premise
game I-premise
. O

Only B-premise
who I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
sharpest I-premise
weapon I-premise
can I-premise
survive I-premise
. O

If B-claim
you I-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
make I-claim
yourself I-claim
outstanding I-claim
enough I-claim
or I-claim
you I-claim
fail I-claim
to I-claim
distinguish I-claim
yourself I-claim
from I-claim
others I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
easily I-claim
replaced I-claim
and I-claim
eliminated I-claim
by I-claim
someone I-claim
who I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
you I-claim
. O

Take O
myself O
for O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
college I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
always I-premise
chosen I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
presenter I-premise
of I-premise
group I-premise
report I-premise
because O
I B-premise
was I-premise
the I-premise
only I-premise
one I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
group I-premise
who I-premise
could I-premise
present I-premise
the I-premise
report I-premise
thoroughly I-premise
and I-premise
fluently I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
being B-claim
unique I-claim
can I-claim
create I-claim
your I-claim
own I-claim
value I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
never I-claim
be I-claim
taken I-claim
by I-claim
others I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
once B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
special I-premise
and I-premise
unique I-premise
, I-premise
pursuing I-premise
success I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
matter I-premise
of I-premise
actively I-premise
creating I-premise
the I-premise
fashion I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
passively I-premise
waiting I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
recognize I-premise
and I-premise
appreciate I-premise
you I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
popular I-premise
and I-premise
prestigious I-premise
technology I-premise
company- I-premise

Apple- I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
. O

The B-premise
reason I-premise
why I-premise
it I-premise
gains I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise
tremendous I-premise
success I-premise
is I-premise
because I-premise
it I-premise
achieves I-premise
some I-premise
brilliant I-premise
qualities I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
never I-premise
be I-premise
caught I-premise
up I-premise
by I-premise
other I-premise
competitors I-premise
. O

It B-premise
has I-premise
its I-premise
operating I-premise
systems I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
run I-premise
smoother I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
companies I-premise
and I-premise
its I-premise
design I-premise
always I-premise
wins I-premise
the I-premise
popularity I-premise
among I-premise
consumers I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
uniqueness I-premise
of I-premise
Apple I-premise
design I-premise
that I-premise
creates I-premise
its I-premise
own I-premise
value I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
being B-claim
different I-claim
and I-claim
unique I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
better I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
success I-claim
. O

It B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
shows I-claim
your I-claim
competence I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
creates I-claim
your I-claim
own I-claim
value I-claim
, I-claim
making I-claim
you I-claim
take I-claim
the I-claim
lead I-claim
in I-claim
your I-claim
way I-claim
towards I-claim
success I-claim
. O

Younger O
school O
children O
should O
study O
art O
and O
music O
Undoubtedly O
, O
math O
, O
language O
, O
science O
and O
history O
are O
all O
extremely O
important O
subjects O
in O
student O
's O
education O
since O
these O
subjects O
provide O
students O
the O
basic O
understanding O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Therefore O
, O
some O
people O
assert O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
learn O
other O
subjects O
for O
younger O
students O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the B-claim
art I-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
, I-claim
from I-claim
my I-claim
point I-claim
of I-claim
view I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
essential I-claim
for I-claim
younger I-claim
student I-claim
's I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
because O
those B-premise
subjects I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
learn I-premise
this I-premise
planet I-premise
from I-premise
another I-premise
perspective I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
release I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
enormous I-premise
pressure I-premise
nowadays I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
agree O
that O
the B-claim
art I-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
required I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
art B-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
would I-claim
broaden I-claim
student I-claim
's I-claim
horizon I-claim
and I-claim
therefore I-claim
make I-claim
them I-claim
thoughtful I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
well I-premise
known I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
bound I-premise
by I-premise
country I-premise
border I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
something I-premise
that I-premise
is I-premise
shared I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
every I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
world I-premise
and I-premise
is I-premise
symbols I-premise
of I-premise
various I-premise
cultures I-premise
. O

Under O
this O
circumstance O
, O
learning B-premise
art I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
enables I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
appreciate I-premise
the I-premise
fruits I-premise
of I-premise
eminent I-premise
artists I-premise
and I-premise
musicians I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
feel I-premise
the I-premise
fascination I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
cultures I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students B-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
feel I-premise
the I-premise
greatest I-premise
music I-premise
masterpiece I-premise
in I-premise
Euopren I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
symphony I-premise
of I-premise
destiny I-premise
- I-premise
Beethoven I-premise
's I-premise
most I-premise
notable I-premise
workpiece I-premise
is I-premise
played I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
studying B-claim
art I-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
the I-claim
appropriate I-claim
outlets I-claim
of I-claim
stress I-claim
and I-claim
superb I-claim
ways I-claim
to I-claim
relax I-claim
. O

Obviously O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
improvement I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
rhythm I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
currently I-premise
suffered I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
pressure I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
or I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
these I-premise
pressure I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
destroy I-premise
one I-premise
person I-premise
if I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
emancipate I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

Art B-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
are I-premise
, I-premise
of I-premise
course I-premise
most I-premise
accessible I-premise
tools I-premise
for I-premise
modern I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
liberate I-premise
themselves I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
extremely I-premise
stressful I-premise
life I-premise
. O

When B-premise
enjoying I-premise
one I-premise
piece I-premise
of I-premise
brilliant I-premise
paintings I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
Mona I-premise
Lisa I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
put I-premise
all I-premise
their I-premise
pressure I-premise
down I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
ground I-premise
and I-premise
just I-premise
think I-premise
about I-premise
what I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
proficient I-premise
and I-premise
mysterious I-premise
smile I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
world I-premise
stands I-premise
for I-premise
. O

At O
this O
moment O
, O
they B-premise
would I-premise
totally I-premise
involve I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
ocean I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
stressful I-premise
nervous I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
relieved I-premise
. O

Apparently O
, O
this B-premise
sense I-premise
towards I-premise
art I-premise
is I-premise
built I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
initial I-premise
study I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-premise
study I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
is I-premise
supposed I-premise
to I-premise
rely I-premise
on I-premise
younger I-premise
student I-premise
's I-premise
own I-premise
interest I-premise
. O

The B-premise
education I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
work I-premise
if I-premise
students I-premise
resist I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
school I-claim
should I-claim
replace I-claim
some I-claim
basic I-claim
science I-claim
class I-claim
with I-claim
some I-claim
art I-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
class I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
cultivate I-claim
student I-claim
's I-claim
interest I-claim
of I-claim
art I-claim
without I-claim
adding I-claim
extra I-claim
study I-claim
pressure I-claim
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
in B-claim
the I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
since I-claim
understanding I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
lengthen I-claim
and I-claim
depth I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
and I-claim
meanwhile I-claim
people I-claim
have I-claim
burdened I-claim
excessive I-claim
pressure I-claim
, O
younger B-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
art I-claim
and I-claim
music I-claim
education I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
take I-claim
the I-claim
second I-claim
place I-claim
. O

Challenges O

In O
my O
opinion O

I O
believe O
that O
every B-claim

the I-claim

are I-claim
getting I-claim
more I-claim
complicated I-claim
and I-claim
challenging I-claim
. O

The O
successful O
people O
are O
those O
who O
can O
quickly O
respond O
to O
this O
rapid O
- O
changing O
world O
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
focusing I-premise
on I-premise
one I-premise
skill I-premise
was I-premise
enough I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
problems I-premise
because O
every B-premise
industry I-premise
was I-premise
rather I-premise
small I-premise
in I-premise
size I-premise
and I-premise
simple I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
. O

However O
, O
as B-premise
those I-premise
industries I-premise
expand I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
internationalized I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
required I-premise
to I-premise
equip I-premise
with I-premise
multiple I-premise
skills I-premise
to I-premise
answer I-premise
those I-premise
challenges I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
now B-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
chances I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
business I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, O
so O
besides B-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
own I-premise
profession I-premise
, I-premise
language I-premise
ability I-premise
is I-premise
essential I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

For O
another O
example O
, O
financial B-premise
crimes I-premise
are I-premise
rampant I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
21st I-premise
century I-premise
, O
thus O
surging B-premise
up I-premise
demands I-premise
for I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
excel I-premise
at I-premise
both I-premise
laws I-premise
and I-premise
financial I-premise
management I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
this B-claim
generation I-claim
is I-claim
encountering I-claim
the I-claim
self I-claim
- I-claim
recognition I-claim
issue I-claim
which I-claim
could I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
experienced I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
previous I-claim
generation I-claim
. O

The B-premise
past I-premise
generation I-premise
was I-premise
given I-premise
less I-premise
freedom I-premise
and I-premise
was I-premise
usually I-premise
asked I-premise
to I-premise
follow I-premise
the I-premise
paths I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
had I-premise
prepared I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
young B-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
this I-claim
generation I-claim
are I-claim
exposed I-claim
to I-claim
more I-claim
creative I-claim
ideas I-claim
and I-claim
rather I-claim
think I-claim
individually I-claim
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
eager I-premise
for I-premise
finding I-premise
who I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
and I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
really I-premise
want I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
fortunate I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
struggle I-premise
with I-premise
these I-premise
sweet I-premise
worries I-premise
and I-premise
these I-premise
worries I-premise
are I-premise
indeed I-premise
never I-premise
easy I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
decisions I-premise
between I-premise
so I-premise
many I-premise
possibilities I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
responsible I-premise
for I-premise
taking I-premise
the I-premise
consequences I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
challenges B-claim
for I-claim
this I-claim
generation I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
complicated I-claim
and I-claim
diverse I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
generation I-claim
, I-claim
whether I-claim
in I-claim
career I-claim
or I-claim
in I-claim
self I-claim
- I-claim
identification I-claim
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
judge O
which O
generation O
's O
problems O
are O
more O
difficult O
but O
it B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
doubt I-claim
that I-claim
until I-claim
the I-claim
next I-claim
generation I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
whole I-claim
new I-claim
challenges I-claim
waiting I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
next I-claim
youngsters I-claim
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
broad O
knowledge O
or O
not O
Views O
differ O
considerably O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
having O
broad O
knowledge O
of O
many O
academic O
subjects O
is O
better O
than O
specializing O
in O
one O
specific O
subject O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
having O
a O
broad O
knowledge O
can O
give O
you O
a O
higher O
chance O
to O
success O
, O
while O
others O
think O
that O
professional O
in O
a O
specific O
subject O
is O
the O
key O
to O
enroll O
a O
success O
. O

Both O
of O
the O
opposite O
arguments O
appear O
to O
be O
somewhat O
convincing O
and O
stand O
to O
reason O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
having B-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
scale I-claim
of I-claim
different I-claim
knowledge I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
key I-claim
to I-claim
success I-claim
. O

The O
following O
will O
present O
my O
points O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when B-claim
one I-claim
knows I-claim
different I-claim
region I-claim
's I-claim
works I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
one I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
a I-claim
friend I-claim
much I-claim
easier I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
worked O
in O
a O
large O
company O
, O
which O
has O
many O
different O
departments O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
Management O
Information O
System O
department O
. O

What O
we O
do O
every O
day O
is O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
that O
our O
clients O
asked O
in O
the O
phone O
. O

While B-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
problems I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
Engineering I-premise
department I-premise
's I-premise
part I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
went I-premise
there I-premise
and I-premise
discussed I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
colleagues I-premise
there I-premise
, O
since O
I B-premise
have I-premise
studied I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
engineering I-premise
courses I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
much I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
contact I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
person I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
department I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
made I-premise
me I-premise
popular I-premise
there I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
much I-premise
easier I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
need I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
when B-claim
you I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
translate I-claim
your I-claim
major I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
things I-claim
about I-claim
different I-claim
fields I-claim
. O

Take O
my O
cousin O
Jeff O
and O
his O
friend O
as O
an O
example O
. O

They O
majored O
in O
financing O
when O
they O
were O
in O
college O
. O

But O
, O
they O
decided O
to O
enroll O
in O
the O
art O
system O
after O
graduated O
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
Jeff I-premise
's I-premise
hard I-premise
working I-premise
during I-premise
his I-premise
leisure I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
learned I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
history I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
. O

Things B-premise
ended I-premise
up I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
joined I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
team I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
his I-premise
friend I-premise
who I-premise
only I-premise
knew I-premise
financing I-premise
issues I-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
nothing I-premise
but I-premise
worked I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
bank I-premise
. O

Although O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
knowing O
different O
fields O
is O
important O
. O

I O
think O
I O
still O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
there O
are O
some O
different O
points O
of O
view O
. O

People O
who O
hold O
different O
opinion O
may O
argue O
that O
if B-claim
one I-claim
ca I-claim
n’t I-claim
success I-claim
one I-claim
’s I-claim
own I-claim
major I-claim
, I-claim
what I-claim
else I-claim
things I-claim
he I-claim
can I-claim
do I-claim
in I-claim
different I-claim
filed I-claim
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
may O
be O
true O
when O
talking O
about O
this O
topic O
. O

However O
, O
what B-premise
if I-premise
one I-premise
finally I-premise
find I-premise
out I-premise
him I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
talent I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
filed I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
it O
wo O
n’t O
be O
a O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
given O
the O
reasons O
described O
above O
, O
when O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
whether O
having O
the O
knowledge O
in O
different O
fields O
is O
better O
or O
not O
are O
carefully O
compared O
. O

The O
best O
choice O
is O
obviously O
stand O
on O
my O
side O
, O
which O
is O
that O
a B-claim
broad I-claim
knowledge I-claim
of I-claim
different I-claim
subjects I-claim
is I-claim
really I-claim
important I-claim
. O

Successful O
people O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O

I O
have O
my O
own O
reasons O
why O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
successful O
people O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O
. O

There O
are O
many O
viewpoints O
regarding O
what O
the O
main O
characteristics O
of O
successful O
people O
are O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
supporting O
this O
statement O
is O
that O
successful B-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
important I-claim
and I-claim
very I-claim
valuable I-claim
points I-claim
from I-claim
trying I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
. O

The O
other O
reason O
is O
that O
great B-claim
success I-claim
requires I-claim
taking I-claim
great I-claim
risks I-claim
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
interesting I-premise
and I-premise
useful I-premise
experiences I-premise
that I-premise
successful I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
them I-premise
only I-premise
by I-premise
trying I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
act I-premise
effectively I-premise
when I-premise
communicating I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
try I-premise
something I-premise
new I-premise
like I-premise
salesmanship I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
stores I-premise
and I-premise
places I-premise
. O

By B-premise
selling I-premise
goods I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
commodities I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
face I-premise
different I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
different I-premise
behaviors I-premise
and I-premise
personalities I-premise
and O
as O
a O
result O
you B-premise
will I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
behave I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
situations I-premise
and I-premise
jobs I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

These B-claim
experiences I-claim
can I-claim
only I-claim
be I-claim
obtained I-claim
by I-claim
trying I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
and I-claim
ca I-claim
n’t I-claim
be I-claim
always I-claim
found I-claim
in I-claim
books I-claim
. O

I O
do O
believe O
that O
great B-premise
success I-premise
requires I-premise
taking I-premise
great I-premise
risks I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
gain I-premise
very I-premise
high I-premise
profits I-premise
in I-premise
investments I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
should I-premise
use I-premise
great I-premise
and I-premise
very I-premise
high I-premise
amounts I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
in I-premise
very I-premise
risky I-premise
financial I-premise
decisions I-premise
and I-premise
dealings I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
you I-premise
may I-premise
lose I-premise
much I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
a I-premise
remarkable I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
exam I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
should I-premise
risk I-premise
studying I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
sacrificing I-premise
your I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
your I-premise
favorite I-premise
hobbies I-premise
. O

The B-premise
more I-premise
you I-premise
take I-premise
risks I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
greater I-premise
your I-premise
successes I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
n’t I-premise
take I-premise
any I-premise
risks I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
ordinary I-premise
life I-premise
with I-premise
average I-premise
successes I-premise
. O

That O
’s O
why O
it B-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
risks I-claim
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
success B-claim
and I-claim
trying I-claim
new I-claim
things I-claim
and I-claim
taking I-claim
risks I-claim
go I-claim
hand I-claim
in I-claim
hand I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
success I-claim
you I-claim
should I-claim
consider I-claim
them I-claim
. O

TV O
has O
adverse O
effects O
on O
friends O
and O
family O
Nowdays O
there O
are O
different O
resources O
to O
entertain O
, O
educate O
and O
inform O
people O
. O

One O
of O
this O
resource O
is O
television O
; O
however O
television O
has O
some O
negative O
effects O
among O
some O
people O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
Television B-claim
has I-claim
destroyed I-claim
communication I-claim
among I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
family I-claim
. O

Some B-claim
People I-claim
spend I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
, I-claim
others I-claim
even I-claim
eat I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
some I-claim
others I-claim
make I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
media I-claim
a I-claim
priority I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
some B-claim
people I-claim
spend I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
. O

Instead B-premise
of I-premise
spend I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
seat I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
chair I-premise
for I-premise
hours I-premise
. O

I B-premise
know I-premise
someone I-premise
who I-premise
wakes I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
and I-premise
before I-premise
even I-premise
eat I-premise
he I-premise
turns I-premise
the I-premise
television I-premise
on I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
even I-premise
records I-premise
the I-premise
programs I-premise
he I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
watch I-premise
during I-premise
work I-premise
hours I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
his I-premise
wife I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
before I-premise
they I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
only I-premise
let I-premise
her I-premise
talk I-premise
during I-premise
commercials I-premise
. O

So O
, O
she B-premise
is I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
his I-premise
habit I-premise
that I-premise
she I-premise
prefers I-premise
to I-premise
write I-premise
him I-premise
an I-premise
email I-premise
. O

Time B-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
family I-premise
is I-premise
gold I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
and I-premise
take I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Another B-claim
way I-claim
television I-claim
has I-claim
destroyed I-claim
communication I-claim
is I-claim
when I-claim
some I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
even I-claim
seat I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
table I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
dinner I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
family I-claim
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
children I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
share I-premise
everything I-premise
about I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
project I-premise
and I-premise
even I-premise
concerns I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
when B-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
dinner I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
fluid I-premise
conversation I-premise
because O
the B-premise
television I-premise
is I-premise
again I-premise
in I-premise
between I-premise
them I-premise
. O

When B-premise
family I-premise
or I-premise
friends I-premise
gather I-premise
together I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
time I-premise
eating I-premise
and I-premise
talking I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
reality I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
cases I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
some B-claim
people I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
television I-claim
a I-claim
priority I-claim
. O

I B-premise
remember I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
told I-premise
me I-premise
one I-premise
day I-premise
that I-premise
because I-premise
she I-premise
was I-premise
watching I-premise
a I-premise
telenovela I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
her I-premise
house I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
time I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
night I-premise
. O

Honestly O
, O
I O
was O
in O
shock O
! O

How O
she O
could O
say O
that O
to O
me O
? O
. O

As O
I O
have O
said O
, O
television B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
tool I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
, I-claim
entertain I-claim
and I-claim
inform I-claim
what I-claim
is I-claim
happening I-claim
, O
but O
I O
agree O
that O
television B-claim
has I-claim
destroyed I-claim
communication I-claim
among I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
family I-claim
as I-claim
soon I-claim
as I-claim
television I-claim
become I-claim
a I-claim
priority I-claim
, I-claim
spend I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
watching I-claim
it I-claim
and I-claim
eat I-claim
in I-claim
front I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
television I-claim
. O

Spending O
equal O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
libraries O
and O
sports O
? O

University O
students O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups O
, O
one O
group O
with O
less O
interest O
to O
study O
and O
the O
other O
which O
include O
hard O
working O
students O
. O

Usually O
the O
second O
group O
's O
members O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
time O
to O
do O
exercise O
. O

We O
all O
know O
doing O
exercise O
for O
at O
least O
30 O
minutes O
form O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
healthy O
and O
happy O
life O
. O

But O
I B-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
think I-claim
that I-claim
equal I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
spent I-claim
on I-claim
academic I-claim
issues I-claim
like I-claim
libraries I-claim
and I-claim
laboratories I-claim
and I-claim
physical I-claim
or I-claim
social I-claim
activities I-claim
. O

First O
, O
in O
my O
view O
spending B-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
equipping I-claim
the I-claim
gyms I-claim
or I-claim
constructing I-claim
football I-claim
/ I-claim
basketball I-claim
courts I-claim
are I-claim
really I-claim
not I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
encourage I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
sports I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
roommate I-premise
, I-premise
Mary I-premise
, I-premise
always I-premise
wakes I-premise
up I-premise
6 I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
and I-premise
spends I-premise
1 I-premise
hour I-premise
doing I-premise
sport I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
park I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
near I-premise
our I-premise
dormitory I-premise
. O

When B-premise
she I-premise
gets I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
dorm I-premise
, I-premise
she I-premise
is I-premise
really I-premise
full I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
and I-premise
after I-premise
taking I-premise
a I-premise
shower I-premise
, I-premise
she I-premise
is I-premise
ready I-premise
to I-premise
start I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
day I-premise
. O

As O
you O
see O
, O
she B-premise
is I-premise
doing I-premise
exercise I-premise
without I-premise
spending I-premise
a I-premise
cent I-premise
. O

What B-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
should I-premise
do I-premise
is I-premise
informing I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
the I-premise
benefits I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
sport I-premise
by I-premise
hanging I-premise
some I-premise
posters I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
campus I-premise
, I-premise
inviting I-premise
some I-premise
athletes I-premise
to I-premise
lecture I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
encourage I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
some I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
body I-premise
and I-premise
health I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
students B-premise
choose I-premise
their I-premise
major I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
interests I-premise
. O

The B-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
equipment I-claim
needed I-claim
for I-claim
physical I-claim
education I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Because O
their B-premise
major I-premise
in I-premise
completely I-premise
involved I-premise
in I-premise
physical I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
for B-premise
an I-premise
engineer I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
medicine I-premise
student I-premise
I I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
find I-premise
it I-premise
fair I-premise
enough I-premise
to I-premise
equip I-premise
gyms I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
laboratories I-premise
, O
because O
it B-premise
really I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
enthusiastic I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
innovative I-premise
technology I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
and I-premise
maybe I-premise
find I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
field I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
spending B-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
social I-claim
activities I-claim
looks I-claim
like I-claim
wasting I-claim
money I-claim
. O

For B-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
gather I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
or I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
out I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
new I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
university I-premise
programs I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
last I-premise
place I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
choose I-premise
. O

For O
example O
when B-premise
I I-premise
and I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
university I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
places I-premise
where I-premise
we I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
disturbed I-premise
by I-premise
any I-premise
familiar I-premise
people I-premise

In O
conclusion O

I B-claim
do I-claim

but O
I O
think O
both B-claim
sports I-claim

However O

someone O

crucial I-claim

Studying B-premise

the O

which O

? O

I O
think O
majority B-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
choose I-premise
the I-premise
former I-premise
because O
it B-premise
has I-premise
more I-premise
chance I-premise

the I-premise
latter I-premise
in I-premise
terms I-premise
of I-premise
getting I-premise
good I-premise

in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I B-claim
do I-claim
really I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
my I-claim
ability I-claim
of I-claim
relating I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
more I-claim
friends I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
studying I-claim
hard I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
. O

It O
is O
essential O
to O
have O
ability O
to O
plan O

organize O
With O
the O
fast O
rolling O
wheels O
of O
modern O
society O
, O
life O
becomes O
more O
complex O
and O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
handle O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
young I-claim
ones I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
possess I-claim
the I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
plan I-claim
and I-claim
organize I-claim
since O
it B-claim
can I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
efficiency I-claim
and I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
crisis I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
actions I-claim

Meanwhile O
, O
eliminating O
meaningless O
actions O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
great B-claim
planning I-claim
and I-claim
organizing I-claim
ability I-claim
is I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
cause I-claim
our I-claim
actions I-claim
more I-claim
efficient I-claim
and I-claim
productive I-claim
. O

Take B-premise
myself I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
overwhelmed I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
burden I-premise
of I-premise
preparing I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
final I-premise
exam I-premise
, I-premise
submitting I-premise
my I-premise
paper I-premise

and I-premise
finishing I-premise
my I-premise
internship I-premise
work I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
term I-premise
. O

Yet B-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
year I-premise
, I-premise
following I-premise
the I-premise
suggestion I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
roommate I-premise
, I-premise
John I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
do I-premise
list I-premise
to I-premise
plan I-premise
and I-premise
organize I-premise
perfectly I-premise
everything I-premise
I I-premise
should I-premise
get I-premise
done I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
final I-premise
and I-premise
hence I-premise
take I-premise
every I-premise
tasks I-premise
and I-premise
trivials I-premise
into I-premise
control I-premise
. O

This B-premise
plan I-premise
ability I-premise
helps I-premise
me I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
, I-premise
making I-premise
me I-premise
climb I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
top I-premise
rank I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
while I-premise
finishing I-premise
everything I-premise
else I-premise
. O

Equally O
important O
, O
the B-claim
capacity I-claim
to I-claim
plan I-claim
and I-claim
organize I-claim
also I-claim
help I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
eliminate I-claim
the I-claim
crisis I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
actions I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
may I-claim
ruin I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
whole I-claim
effort I-claim
over I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
long I-claim
time I-claim
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
, O
the B-premise
employees I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
company I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
profit I-premise
as I-premise
much I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
supervisors I-premise
and I-premise
complete I-premise
their I-premise
assignments I-premise
perfectly I-premise
. O

If B-premise
some I-premise
employees I-premise
lack I-premise
the I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
plan I-premise
and I-premise
organize I-premise
ahead I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
procrastination I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
take I-premise
into I-premise
action I-premise
until I-premise
the I-premise
deadline I-premise
is I-premise
imminent I-premise
. O

However O
, O
things O
have O
been O
changing O
all O
the O
time O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the B-premise
deadline I-premise
of I-premise
task I-premise
is I-premise
shifted I-premise
to I-premise
an I-premise
earlier I-premise
date I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
change I-premise
of I-premise
company I-premise
's I-premise
schedule I-premise
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
those B-premise
employees I-premise
who I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
plan I-premise
and I-premise
finish I-premise
their I-premise
assignments I-premise
ahead I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
perhaps I-premise
are I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
these I-premise
tasks I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
penalized I-premise
or I-premise
get I-premise
fired I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
employee I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
this I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
loss I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
some O
assert O
that O
the B-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
plan I-premise
and I-premise
organize I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
learned I-premise
until I-premise
obtaining I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
need I-claim
for I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
possess I-claim
this I-claim
ability I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
this B-premise
ability I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
essential I-premise
for I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
since O
young B-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
overcome I-premise
their I-premise
bad I-premise
habits I-premise
and I-premise
fulfill I-premise
their I-premise
goals I-premise
more I-premise
quickly I-premise
with I-premise
this I-premise
ability I-premise
. O

As B-premise
searching I-premise
information I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
probably I-premise
distracted I-premise
by I-premise
other I-premise
attractions I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
online I-premise
games I-premise
or I-premise
social I-premise
webs I-premise
. O

At O
this O
circumstances O
, O
they B-premise
would I-premise
surf I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
for I-premise
hours I-premise
and I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
no I-premise
where I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
obviously I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

But O
if B-premise
they I-premise
make I-premise
their I-premise
plan I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
stick I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
plans I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
get I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
done I-premise
quickly I-premise
beyond I-premise
their I-premise
imagination I-premise
. O

In B-claim
this I-claim
complex I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
, I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
encompassed I-claim
with I-claim
multiple I-claim
tasks I-claim
, O
so O
the B-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
plan I-claim
and I-claim
organize I-claim
is I-claim
undoubtedly I-claim
a I-claim
powerful I-claim
and I-claim
sharp I-claim
weapon I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
must I-claim
be I-claim
armed I-claim
with I-claim
. O

classes O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
benefits O
for O
students O
and O
provide O
them O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
learning O
opportunities O
( O
options O
) O
as O
well O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
to O
this O
popular O
belief O
, O
there O
are O
still O
those O
who O
subscribe O
to O
this O
view O
that O
having O
a O
choice O
for O
attending O
classes O
enable O
students O
to O
study O
at O
home O
and O
through O
this O
way O
they O
do O
not O
waste O
their O
time O
for O
commuting O
and O
also O
they O
can O
save O
their O
money O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
being B-claim
present I-claim
at I-claim
classes I-claim
seems I-claim
a I-claim
wiser I-claim
option I-claim
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
being B-claim
present I-claim
at I-claim
classes I-claim
provide I-claim
students I-claim
with I-claim
opportunity I-claim
of I-claim
communicating I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
students I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
beneficial I-claim
for I-claim
understanding I-claim
new I-claim
material I-claim
by I-claim
reviewing I-claim
them I-claim
throughout I-claim
the I-claim
free I-claim
times I-claim
in I-claim
college I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
for I-premise
learning I-premise
materials I-premise
better I-premise
. O

However O
, O
if B-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
attend I-premise
classes I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
others I-premise
for I-premise
assisting I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
comprehend I-premise
difficult I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Another O
significant O
fact O
which O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
is O
that O
by B-claim
the I-claim
help I-claim
of I-claim
teachers I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
understand I-claim
ideas I-claim
faster I-claim
and I-claim
easier I-claim
since O
teachers B-premise
explain I-premise
them I-premise
thoroughly I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
and I-premise
after I-premise
that I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
examples I-premise
to I-premise
clarify I-premise
the I-premise
points I-premise
. O

In B-premise
this I-premise
way I-premise
attending I-premise
classes I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
wastes I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
facilitates I-premise
their I-premise
understanding I-premise
process I-premise
that I-premise
takes I-premise
them I-premise
less I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
comprehending I-premise
materials I-premise
in I-premise
comparison I-premise
with I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Finally O
yet O
importantly O
, O
appearing B-claim
in I-claim
class I-claim
makes I-claim
students I-claim
more I-claim
conscientious I-claim
since O
they B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
obey I-premise
class I-premise
’s I-premise
disciplines I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
practice I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
perseverance I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
their I-premise
assignments I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
ones I-premise
who I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
any I-premise
discipline I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
force I-premise
themselves I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
particular I-premise
times I-premise
. O

Through O
this O
way O
, O
they B-premise
may I-premise
miss I-premise
some I-premise
important I-premise
parts I-premise
in I-premise
virtue I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
chaotic I-premise
and I-premise
incoherent I-premise
study I-premise
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
points O
mentioned O
above O
, O
I O
convinced O
that O
communicating B-claim
and I-claim
studying I-claim
with I-claim
peer I-claim
group I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
learning I-claim
materials I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
teachers B-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
conspicuous I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
assisting I-claim
students I-claim
for I-claim
learning I-claim
materials I-claim
that I-claim
being I-claim
present I-claim
at I-claim
classes I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
requisite I-claim
for I-claim
benefiting I-claim
it I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
attending B-claim
to I-claim
classes I-claim
makes I-claim
students I-claim
more I-claim
attentive I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
their I-claim
studies I-claim
on I-claim
time I-claim
that I-claim
this I-claim
attitude I-claim
lead I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
success I-claim
. O

Telephones O
and O
emails O
have O
made O
personal O
communication O
less O
required O
There O
are O
many O
advantage O
of O
these O
invention O
, O
telephones O
and O
email O
. O

Communication B-claim
between I-claim
people I-claim
by I-claim
using I-claim
telephones I-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
made I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
easier I-claim
. O

I B-claim
personally I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
this I-claim
notion I-claim
that I-claim
these I-claim
types I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
, I-claim
telephones I-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
, I-claim
made I-claim
people I-claim
less I-claim
personal I-claim
. O

I O
will O
give O
several O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
telephones B-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
who I-claim
live I-claim
far I-claim
away I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
connect I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

Unlike B-premise
email I-premise
, I-premise
send I-premise
message I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
mail I-premise
service I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
lost I-premise
and I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
sent I-premise
to I-premise
wrong I-premise
address I-premise
. O

I B-premise
can I-premise
using I-premise
telephones I-premise
and I-premise
email I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
or I-premise
write I-premise
directly I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
connect I-premise
with I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
right O
now O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
U.S. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
possible I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
conversation I-premise
in I-premise
person I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
phone I-premise
call I-premise
or I-premise
write I-premise
email I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
whenever I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
. O

Telephones B-premise
and I-premise
email I-premise
made I-premise
me I-premise
feel I-premise
close I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
using B-claim
telephones I-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
could I-claim
express I-claim
some I-claim
important I-claim
words I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
face I-claim
- I-claim
to I-claim
- I-claim
face I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

For O
instant O
, O
sometime B-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
argue I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
express I-premise
my I-premise
self I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
at I-premise
that I-premise
moment I-premise
. O

So O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
realize I-premise
what I-premise
had I-premise
happened I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
explain I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
thought I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
express I-premise
without I-premise
emotion I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
these B-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
communications I-premise
make I-premise
me I-premise
feel I-premise
personal I-premise
. O

Telephones B-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
make I-claim
me I-claim
feel I-claim
personal I-claim
because O
I B-premise
could I-premise
directly I-premise
connect I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
love I-premise
. O

Beside O
, O
I B-premise
could I-premise
express I-premise
my I-premise
personal I-premise
thought I-premise
through I-premise
telephones I-premise
and I-premise
email I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
telephones B-claim
and I-claim
email I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
make I-claim
communication I-claim
between I-claim
people I-claim
less I-claim
personal I-claim
. O

Big O
city O
vs O
small O
town O

I B-claim
highly I-claim
prefer I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
to I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
countryside I-claim
. O

The B-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
have I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
advantages I-claim
and I-claim
facilities I-claim
over I-claim
the I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
. O

Where B-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
lives I-claim
and I-claim
grow I-claim
up I-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
his I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
, O
because O
the B-premise
environment I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
grow I-premise
up I-premise
, I-premise
build I-premise
the I-premise
personality I-premise
and I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
social I-premise
places I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
like I-premise
restaurants I-premise
, I-premise
museums I-premise
, I-premise
bars I-premise
, I-premise
sporting I-premise
clubs I-premise
, I-premise
cinemas I-premise
, I-premise
theatre I-premise
and I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

People B-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
have I-claim
many I-claim
options I-claim
to I-claim
enjoy I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
and I-claim
spend I-claim
their I-claim
times I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
friends I-claim
in I-claim
social I-claim
places I-claim
in I-claim
contrary I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
who I-claim
have I-claim
few I-claim
choices I-claim
and I-claim
at I-claim
most I-claim
cases I-claim
one I-claim
bar I-claim
or I-claim
one I-claim
cinema I-claim
to I-claim
socialize I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

In B-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
educational I-premise
facilities I-premise
is I-premise
quite I-premise
better I-premise
than I-premise
small I-premise
towns I-premise
with I-premise
more I-premise
experienced I-premise
and I-premise
profession I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

It O
’s O
undisputed O
that O
in B-premise
this I-premise
modern I-premise
world I-premise
education I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
human I-premise
kind I-premise
future I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Better B-premise
education I-premise
results I-premise
better I-premise
career I-premise
and I-premise
been I-premise
well I-premise
paid I-premise
. O

So O
persons B-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
the I-claim
better I-claim
job I-claim
than I-claim
people I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
. O

Also O
lots B-premise
of I-premise
companies I-premise
placed I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
job I-premise
positions I-premise
in I-premise
there I-premise
than I-premise
small I-premise
towns I-premise
. O

But O
by B-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
one I-claim
sacrifices I-claim
quiet I-claim
and I-claim
peaceful I-claim
life I-claim
with I-claim
breathing I-claim
fresh I-claim
air I-claim
and I-claim
loses I-claim
much I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
traffic I-claim
and I-claim
anyway I-claim
for I-claim
transportation I-claim
, O
because O
distances B-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
often I-premise
are I-premise
too I-premise
far I-premise
to I-premise
pass I-premise
quickly I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
technology I-premise
has I-premise
it I-premise
’s I-premise
good I-premise
and I-premise
bad I-premise
effects I-premise

but I-premise
I I-premise
prefer I-premise
having I-premise
the I-premise
technologies I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
disadvantages I-premise
to I-premise
living I-premise
like I-premise
16 I-premise
century I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
facilities I-premise
of I-premise
technology I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
what O
mentioned O
, O
medical B-claim
technologies I-claim
is I-claim
completely I-claim
better I-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
and I-claim

in I-claim
my I-claim
view I-claim
this I-claim
profit I-claim
overcomes I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
bad I-claim
influences I-claim
of I-claim
technologies I-claim
on I-claim
human I-claim
kind I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
in O
my O
view O
living B-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
is I-claim
quite I-claim
funnier I-claim
and I-claim
better I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
exciting I-claim
than I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
many I-claim
more I-claim
social I-claim
places I-claim
, I-claim
technologies I-claim
facilities I-claim
, I-claim
better I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
medical I-claim
services I-claim
. O

Which O
do O
you O
prefer O
: O
do O
only O
what O
you O
already O
do O
well O
, O
or O
not O
. O

You O
may O
love O
to O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O
even O
if O
you O
are O
n't O
good O
at O
the O
things O
. O

That O
may O
help O
you O
expand O
experiences O
, O
look O
for O
your O
personalities O
and O
find O
your O
new O
talents O
. O

This O
ideal O
, O
however O
, O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
be O
accomplished O
. O

If O
not O
, O
you O
might O
lose O
another O
chance O
that O
you O
could O
use O
to O
accomplish O
other O
things O
. O

So O
, O
I O
definitely O
believe O
that O
you B-claim
should I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
good I-claim
at I-claim
. O

Focusing B-premise
what I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
good I-premise
at I-premise
helps I-premise
you I-premise
attain I-premise
your I-premise
goal I-premise
. O

Without O
doubt O
, O
the B-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
you I-premise
spend I-premise
on I-premise
what I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
well I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
something I-premise
great I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Albert B-premise
Einstein I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
competent I-premise
physicians I-premise
in I-premise
history I-premise
, I-premise
devoted I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
life I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
theory I-premise
in I-premise
physics I-premise
and I-premise
finally I-premise
established I-premise
special I-premise
and I-premise
general I-premise
relativity I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
he B-premise
hardly I-premise
cared I-premise
about I-premise
something I-premise
else I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
said I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
surprisingly I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
never I-premise
tried I-premise
to I-premise
distinguish I-premise
a I-premise
hand I-premise
soup I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
facial I-premise
soup I-premise
because O
, O
at O
least O
for O
him O
, O
using B-premise
two I-premise
different I-premise
soups I-premise
properly I-premise
was I-premise
quite I-premise
annoying I-premise
. O

As O
the O
example O
above O
indicates O
, O
you B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
accomplish I-claim
your I-claim
purpose I-claim
by I-claim
concentrating I-claim
on I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
do I-claim
well I-claim
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
keep I-premise
doing I-premise
what I-premise
you I-premise
already I-premise
do I-premise
well I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
better I-premise
good I-premise
at I-premise
it I-premise
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
're I-premise
doing I-premise
something I-premise
well I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
more I-premise
satisfied I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Then O
, O
you B-premise
will I-premise
motivate I-premise
yourself I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
more I-premise
. O

To O
give O
an O
example O
, O
I B-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
good I-premise
at I-premise
math I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
junior I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
. O

Because O
I B-premise
was I-premise
really I-premise
satisfied I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
do I-premise
preferably I-premise
, O
I B-premise
became I-premise
to I-premise
absorb I-premise
myself I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
more I-premise
advanced I-premise
level I-premise
of I-premise
math I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I B-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
get I-premise
higher I-premise
scores I-premise
in I-premise
math I-premise
test I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
solve I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
- I-premise
level I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
by B-claim
doing I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
good I-claim
at I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
better I-claim
at I-claim
it I-claim
. O

In O
summary O
, O
doing B-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
already I-claim
do I-claim
well I-claim
helps I-claim
you I-claim
make I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
accomplishment I-claim
and I-claim
do I-claim
it I-claim
much I-claim
better I-claim
. O

the O
best O
way O
to O
learn O
responsibility O
? O

many O
people O
argue O
about O
learning O
their O
children O
the O
financial O
responsibility O
in O
young O
ages O
or O
in O
adulthood O
. O

I O
am O
a O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
believes O
to O
children B-claim
should I-claim
learn I-claim
to I-claim
manage I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
money I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
young I-claim
age I-claim
, O
due O
to O
reasons O
that O
I O
stated O
below O
. O

The O
first O
important O
point O
that O
I O
want O
to O
make O
is O
that O
sociologists B-premise
found I-premise
that I-premise
our I-premise
characteristics I-premise
and I-premise
personality I-premise
forms I-premise
early I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
though I-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
borne I-premise
. O

So O
it B-claim
is I-claim
crucial I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
our I-claim
children I-claim
as I-claim
soon I-claim
as I-claim
possible I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
financially I-claim
issues I-claim
. O

To O
clarify O
my O
point O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
memory O
from O
my O
childhood O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
at I-premise
age I-premise
7 I-premise
my I-premise
father I-premise
gave I-premise
me I-premise
monthly I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
thing I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
liked I-premise
. O

First B-premise
time I-premise
I I-premise
spend I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
eat I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
and I-premise
my I-premise
money I-premise
finished I-premise
. O

I B-premise
asked I-premise
my I-premise
father I-premise
for I-premise
extra I-premise
money I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
refuse I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
it I-premise
to I-premise
me I-premise
. O

I B-premise
found I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
should I-premise
manage I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
spend I-premise
money I-premise
. O

From O
then O
I B-premise
learned I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
economical I-premise

and I-premise
now I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
every I-premise
thing I-premise
I I-premise
wanted I-premise
. O

Another O
aspect O
of O
learning O
children O
to O
manage O
their O
money O
is O
on O
the O
finance O
of O
the O
family O
. O

If B-premise
parents I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
all I-premise
they I-premise
wanted I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
run I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
essential I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

Even B-claim
in I-claim
rich I-claim
families I-claim
if I-claim
children I-claim
did I-claim
not I-claim
learn I-claim
to I-claim
manage I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
money I-claim
, I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
grow I-claim
up I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
become I-claim
unappreciative I-claim
and I-claim
dependent I-claim
persons I-claim
who I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
just I-claim
used I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
prosperity I-claim
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
I B-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
to I-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
rich I-premise
and I-premise
prosperous I-premise
family I-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
parent I-premise
gave I-premise
him I-premise
everything I-premise
he I-premise
demanded I-premise
from I-premise
his I-premise
childhood I-premise
. O

He B-premise
became I-premise
an I-premise
arrogant I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
stand I-premise
on I-premise
his I-premise
feet I-premise
and I-premise
always I-premise
asked I-premise
for I-premise
money I-premise
. O

His B-premise
parent I-premise
tried I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
and I-premise
hired I-premise
some I-premise
experts I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
him I-premise
manage I-premise
his I-premise
financial I-premise
and I-premise
carrier I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
unfortunately I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
useless I-premise
. O

Finally B-premise
one I-premise
night I-premise
, I-premise
having I-premise
fun I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
irresponsible I-premise
friend I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
luxuries I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
crashed I-premise
a I-premise
truck I-premise
and I-premise
died I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
did I-premise
he I-premise
cause I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
damage I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
property I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
bring I-premise
sorry I-premise
to I-premise
his I-premise
family I-premise
. O

Although O
some O
people O
argue O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
free I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
to I-claim
they I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
, O
In O
my O
opinion O
it B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
our I-claim
children I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
beginning I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
financially I-claim
responsible I-claim
persons I-claim
, O
because O
our B-claim
personality I-claim
form I-claim
in I-claim
childhood I-claim
and I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
change I-claim
it I-claim
in I-claim
adulthood I-claim
. O

Dancing O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
culture O
. O

In O
every O
country O
, O
people O
do O
dance O
for O
fun O
, O
for O
entertrain O
, O
and O
for O
decrease O
a O
stress O
. O

Dancing O
is O
also O
one O
of O
important O
parts O
of O
culture O
that O
represent O
to O
something O
that O
people O
believe O
. O

Many O
cultures O
do O
dance O
to O
show O
a O
great O
prosperous O
of O
its O
culture O
. O

And O
also O
dancing O
to O
entertain O
people O
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

First O
, O
dancing B-premise
are I-premise
significant I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
culture I-premise
that I-premise
could I-premise
show I-premise
to I-premise
something I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
believe I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
some B-premise
culture I-premise
people I-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
dance I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
sacrifice I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
god I-premise
so I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
happy I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Or B-premise
some I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
arid I-premise
area I-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
danced I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
rain I-premise
would I-premise
come I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
dancing B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
belief I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
dancing B-claim
can I-claim
represent I-claim
to I-claim
civilization I-claim
of I-claim
that I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
have I-premise
seen I-premise
many I-premise
western I-premise
movies I-premise
that I-premise
when I-premise
a I-premise
kingdom I-premise
have I-premise
visitor I-premise
from I-premise
another I-premise
kingdom I-premise
, I-premise
king I-premise
or I-premise
queen I-premise
would I-premise
dance I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
a I-premise
splendid I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
kingdom I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

The B-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
movement I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
costume I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
music I-premise
while I-premise
they I-premise
dance I-premise
. O

All B-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
civilization I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
many B-premise
culture I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
many I-premise
ways I-premise
to I-premise
entertain I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

And O
dancing B-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
that I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

Both B-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
see I-premise
and I-premise
dance I-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
time I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
many B-premise
event I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
christmas I-premise
, I-premise
last I-premise
christmas I-premise
I I-premise
went I-premise
to I-premise
mall I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
gifts I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
entertained I-premise
by I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
santa I-premise
custom I-premise
dancing I-premise
in I-premise
christmas I-premise
song I-premise
. O

I B-premise
felt I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
around I-premise
me I-premise
happy I-premise
and I-premise
group I-premise
of I-premise
santas I-premise
also I-premise
happy I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
people I-premise
happy I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
notion O
that O
dancing B-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
culture I-claim
because O
dancing B-claim
are I-claim
represent I-claim
to I-claim
believe I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
dancing B-premise
could I-premise
show I-premise
how I-premise
civilization I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
culture I-premise
is I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
people B-premise
use I-premise
dancing I-premise
to I-premise
entertain I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

So O
dancing B-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

The O
internet O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O
valuable O
information O

In O
the O
modern O
society O
, O
internet O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
inventions O
over O
the O
past O
century O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
several O
problems O
occur O
from O
an O
information O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

However O
, O
some O
say O
that O
the B-claim
internet I-claim
provides I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
valuable I-claim
information I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
because O
the B-claim
internet I-claim
gives I-claim
daily I-claim
necessary I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
gain I-claim
knowledge I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
explore I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
everybody B-claim
would I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
what I-claim
is I-claim
going I-claim
on I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
everyday I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Sometimes B-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
an I-premise
information I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
daily I-premise
life I-premise
which I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
businessman I-premise
who I-premise
has I-premise
no I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
watch I-premise
a I-premise
television I-premise
or I-premise
read I-premise
a I-premise
newspaper I-premise
can I-premise
receive I-premise
news I-premise
and I-premise
check I-premise
stock I-premise
markets I-premise
easily I-premise
via I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
people B-claim
can I-claim
gain I-claim
more I-claim
knowledge I-claim
by I-claim
using I-claim
the I-claim
internet I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
useful I-claim
technology I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
take I-premise
online I-premise
courses I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
or I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
watch I-premise
beneficial I-premise
videos I-premise
which I-premise
also I-premise
teach I-premise
them I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
only I-premise
students I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
everyone I-premise
could I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
information I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people B-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
problems I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
health I-premise
can I-premise
search I-premise
for I-premise
more I-premise
information I-premise
about I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
The B-claim
internet I-claim
makes I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
becomes I-claim
smaller I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
thing I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
people B-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
time I-premise
or I-premise
have I-premise
financial I-premise
problems I-premise
could I-premise
travel I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
see I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
picture I-premise
and I-premise
videos I-premise
of I-premise
many I-premise
interesting I-premise
places I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
people B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
's I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
tradition I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
them I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
that I-premise
nations I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
people B-claim
are I-claim
satisfied I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
internet I-claim
and I-claim
sometimes I-claim
even I-claim
thanks I-claim
it I-claim
because O
it B-claim
helps I-claim
us I-claim
in I-claim
studying I-claim
, I-claim
doing I-claim
business I-claim
and I-claim
exploring I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
. O

With B-claim
valuable I-claim
information I-claim
it I-claim
provides I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
enjoy I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
much I-claim
more I-claim
. O

Universities O
require O
students O
to O
study O
many O
subjects O
or O
specialize O
in O
one O
subject O
University O
is O
the O
place O
that O
provides O
people O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
to O
use O
in O
their O
real O
life O
. O

Some O
universities O
require O
students O
to O
study O
in O
one O
subject O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
others O
require O
students O
to O
study O
in O
several O
subjects O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
studying B-claim
many I-claim
subjects I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
that I-claim
one I-claim
because O
students B-claim
can I-claim
study I-claim
in I-claim
subjects I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
interested I-claim
in I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
gain I-claim
knowledge I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
one I-claim
field I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when B-premise
students I-premise
finished I-premise
their I-premise
high I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
confused I-premise
about I-premise
subjects I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
they B-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
subjects I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
them I-premise
all I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
pupil B-premise
who I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
science I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
music I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
requiring B-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
subjects I-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
know I-claim
a I-claim
wide I-claim
range I-claim
of I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
know I-claim
just I-claim
one I-claim
. O

Students B-premise
can I-premise
gain I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
different I-premise
subjects I-premise
thy I-premise
study I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
university B-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
study I-premise
business I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
know I-premise
history I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
gain I-premise
knowledge I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
experience I-premise
because O
they B-premise
will I-premise
meet I-premise
new I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
they B-premise
all I-premise
can I-premise
share I-premise
opinion I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
one I-premise
another I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
students B-claim
who I-claim
graduated I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
variety I-claim
of I-claim
courses I-claim
during I-claim
university I-claim
and I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
experience I-claim
are I-claim
definitely I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
or I-claim
career I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
graduates B-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
works I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
select I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
they I-premise
prefer I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
will I-premise
choose I-premise
a I-premise
career I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
including I-premise
the I-premise
job I-premise
with I-premise
high I-premise
salary I-premise
include I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
bachelors B-premise
can I-premise
earn I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
by I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
fields I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

In O
concluding O
, O
learning B-claim
several I-claim
subjects I-claim
in I-claim
universities I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
specialize I-claim
in I-claim
one I-claim
subject I-claim
because O
it B-claim
makes I-claim
students I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
gain I-claim
knowledge I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
and I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Governments O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
space O
exploration O
or O
for O
basic O
needs O
of O
people O

Although O
developing O
technologies O
to O
discover O
amazing O
thing O
in O
galaxy O
is O
interesting O
, O
there O
are O
many O
people O
in O
the O
world O
are O
in O
poverty O
or O
starvation O
. O

Thus O
, O
these O
technologies O
mean O
nothing O
if O
people O
lack O
of O
prosperity O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
accede O
with O
notion O
that O
government B-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
attention I-claim
on I-claim
basic I-claim
needs I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
first I-claim
. O

First O
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
that O
after B-premise
great I-premise
economic I-premise
recession I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
were I-premise
unemployed I-premise
. O

Then O
, O
many O
people O
did O
not O
have O
money O
. O

When B-premise
people I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
money I-premise
, I-premise
They I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
rob I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
. O

There B-premise
were I-premise
increasing I-premise
in I-premise
criminal I-premise
rate I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
quality B-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
were I-premise
dropping I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
make I-premise
people I-premise
unhappy I-premise
. O

So O
that O
, O
government B-claim
should I-claim
invest I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
more I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

When B-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
steal I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
criminal B-premise
rate I-premise
were I-premise
drop I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
people B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
quality I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
environment B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
important I-premise
issue I-premise
that I-premise
everyone I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Nowaday O
, O
industrial B-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
still I-premise
emit I-premise
high I-premise
intense I-premise
of I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxide I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
caused I-premise
of I-premise
greenhouse I-premise
effect I-premise
. O

Greenhouse B-premise
effect I-premise
causes I-premise
of I-premise
climate I-premise
change I-premise
. O

These B-premise
impact I-premise
on I-premise
every I-premise
living I-premise
creature I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

So O
, O
government B-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
issue I-premise
by I-premise
declare I-premise
regulate I-premise
to I-premise
control I-premise
emission I-premise
of I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxide I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
controlling O
emission O
carbon O
dioxide O
, O
government B-claim
should I-claim
invest I-claim
in I-claim
alternative I-claim
energy I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
using I-claim
solar I-claim
energy I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
coal I-claim
energy I-claim
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
lived I-premise
in I-premise
good I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
our I-premise
life I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
better I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
family B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
root I-premise
of I-premise
society I-premise
. O

If B-premise
everyone I-premise
in I-premise
family I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
family I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
If I-premise
family I-premise
had I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
mean I-premise
society I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

When B-premise
society I-premise
had I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
could I-premise
impact I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
nation I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
government B-claim
should I-claim
create I-claim
campaign I-claim
to I-claim
fill I-claim
love I-claim
to I-claim
family I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
setting B-premise
event I-premise
once I-premise
a I-premise
week I-premise
to I-premise
gather I-premise
everyone I-premise
in I-premise
family I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

When B-premise
family I-premise
understand I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
mean I-premise
society I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
nation I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
much I-premise
trouble I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
agree O
with O
statement O
that O
government B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
basic I-claim
people I-claim
needs I-claim
. O

The O
basic O
needs O
: O
jobs O
, O
good O
environment O
, O
and O
love O
in O
family O
. O

These B-claim
three I-claim
issues I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
basic I-claim
needs I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
opinion I-claim
that I-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
attention I-claim
on I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
quality I-claim
life I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Best O
ways O
of O
reducing O
stress O
: O
listening O
to O
music O
, O
exercise O
, O
meditation O

Nowadays O
, O
we O
are O
living O
in O
in O
the O
world O
which O
is O
absolutely O
complicated O
. O

Everything O
seem O
to O
be O
rush O
, O
and O
it O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
competition O
. O

These O
make O
people O
get O
stress O
. O

Thus O
, O
many O
people O
try O
to O
reduce O
their O
stress O
. O

There O
are O
many O
activities O
that O
could O
relieve O
those O
people O
who O
are O
in O
stress O
. O

in O
my O
opinion O
, O
reducing B-claim
stress I-claim
by I-claim
listening I-claim
to I-claim
music I-claim
, I-claim
playing I-claim
sports I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
meditation I-claim
are I-claim
easy I-claim
and I-claim
practical I-claim
ways I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
listening B-claim
to I-claim
music I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
relax I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
office O
, O
I O
use O
public O
transport O
. O

I O
see O
many O
things O
such O
as O
traffic O
jam O
, O
crowded O
people O
at O
bus O
stop O
, O
and O
all O
so O
crowded O
people O
in O
buses O
. O

These O
make O
me O
stress O
. O

So O
that O
I B-premise
always I-premise
listen I-premise
music I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
mp3 I-premise
player I-premise
. O

I B-premise
could I-premise
enjoy I-premise
listening I-premise
music I-premise
without I-premise
thinking I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
around I-premise
me I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
I B-premise
feel I-premise
happy I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
listen I-premise
music I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
another B-claim
way I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
perfectly I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
everyone I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
stress I-claim
is I-claim
exercise I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I O
alway O
have O
many O
things O
in O
my O
mind O
such O
as O
a O
difficult O
of O
my O
work O
that O
I O
have O
to O
finish O
in O
time O
. O

These O
problem O
sometime O
make O
me O
hard O
to O
fall O
asleep O
because O
it O
make O
me O
stress O
. O

Thus O
, O
after B-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
always I-premise
do I-premise
exercise I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
jogging I-premise
is I-premise
my I-premise
favorite I-premise
sport I-premise
. O

I B-premise
feel I-premise
that I-premise
after I-premise
working I-premise
out I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
easily I-premise
to I-premise
fall I-premise
asleep I-premise
. O

Exercising B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
reduce I-premise
my I-premise
stress I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
make I-premise
me I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
meditation B-claim
also I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
ways I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
stress I-claim
. O

when O
I O
have O
many O
things O
to O
think O
about O
, O
and O
this O
make O
me O
stress O
, O
I O
will O
do O
meditation O
. O

Meditation B-premise
is I-premise
easy I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
relax I-premise
because O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
require I-premise
any I-premise
equipment I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
take I-premise
few I-premise
minutes I-premise
. O

A B-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
meditation I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
just I-premise
sit I-premise
down I-premise
, I-premise
close I-premise
my I-premise
eyes I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
count I-premise
my I-premise
breath I-premise
. O

These B-premise
could I-premise
relieve I-premise
me I-premise
from I-premise
stress I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
to O
reduce O
the O
stress O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
listening B-claim
to I-claim
music I-claim
, I-claim
exercising I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
doing I-claim
meditation I-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
activities I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
could I-claim
do I-claim
to I-claim
escape I-claim
from I-claim
stress I-claim
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
are I-claim
easy I-claim
and I-claim
usable I-claim
. O

And B-claim
everyone I-claim
should I-claim
find I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
more I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
to I-claim
feel I-claim
better I-claim
physically I-claim
and I-claim
in I-claim
everyone I-claim
mind I-claim
. O

Should O
teachers O
be O
paid O
according O
to O
how O
much O
their O
students O
learn O
? O

Everyone O
is O
different O
. O

Although O
students O
are O
in O
the O
same O
process O
of O
education O
system O
, O
learning O
abilities O
in O
each O
students O
are O
not O
equal O
. O

Some O
students O
are O
fast O
learner O
, O
but O
some O
students O
are O
not O
. O

Thus O
, O
paying B-claim
for I-claim
teacher I-claim
base I-claim
on I-claim
grade I-claim
that I-claim
students I-claim
got I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
appropriate I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
fair I-claim
for I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

So O
that O
, O
I O
disagree O
with O
this O
notion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
in O
schools O
, O
main B-premise
task I-premise
of I-premise
teacher I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
role I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
in I-premise
time I-premise
. O

there B-premise
are I-premise
certain I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
teachers I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
. O

In B-premise
these I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
possible I-premise
for I-premise
teachers I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
attention I-premise
to I-premise
individual I-premise
students I-premise
in I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Teachers B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
manage I-claim
to I-claim
teach I-claim
every I-claim
topics I-claim
by I-claim
schedule I-claim
. O

If B-premise
teachers I-premise
pay I-premise
attention I-premise
to I-premise
specific I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
finish I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
might I-premise
make I-premise
many I-premise
student I-premise
miss I-premise
some I-premise
field I-premise
in I-premise
topics I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
should I-premise
know I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
learning B-premise
abilities I-premise
in I-premise
each I-premise
students I-premise
is I-premise
different I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
possible I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
all I-premise
comprehend I-premise
all I-premise
lessons I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
students I-premise
might I-premise
understand I-premise
all I-premise
topics I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
had I-premise
learnt I-premise
but I-premise
some I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
testing B-premise
result I-premise
are I-premise
different I-premise
. O

This B-premise
problems I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
hard I-premise
study I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
teachers I-premise
fault I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
teachers B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
paid I-claim
by I-claim
testing I-claim
result I-claim
that I-claim
students I-claim
get I-claim
. O

Lastly O
, O
there B-premise
could I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
problem I-premise
if I-premise
schools I-premise
pay I-premise
teachers I-premise
by I-premise
grade I-premise
that I-premise
students I-premise
get I-premise
. O

That B-premise
is I-premise
problem I-premise
in I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Teacher B-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
care I-premise
about I-premise
how I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
understand I-premise
the I-premise
topics I-premise
. O

Teachers B-premise
may I-premise
just I-premise
give I-premise
high I-premise
grades I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
higher I-premise
salary I-premise
. O

This B-premise
problem I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
happened I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
grade B-claim
that I-claim
students I-claim
get I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
in I-claim
evaluating I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
totally I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
this I-claim
statement I-claim
that I-claim
teachers I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
paid I-claim
by I-claim
how I-claim
much I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
learn I-claim
because O
teacher B-claim
could I-claim
not I-claim
pay I-claim
attention I-claim
to I-claim
each I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
class I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
learning B-claim
abilities I-claim
of I-claim
student I-claim
are I-claim
different I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
problems I-claim
if I-claim
paying I-claim
teacher I-claim
by I-claim
grade I-claim
students I-claim
get I-claim
. O

Should O
good O
people O
are O
rewarded O
and O
bad O
people O
are O
punished O
in O
movies O
or O
dramas O
? O

When O
we O
watch O
movies O
or O
dramas O
, O
some O
of O
us O
like O
to O
see O
good O
people O
have O
a O
good O
ending O
and O
bad O
people O
are O
punished O
. O

While O
there O
are O
also O
some O
people O
who O
do O
not O
like O
this O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
prefer O
to O
see O
good O
people O
get O
rewarded O
. O

However O
, O
if B-claim
the I-claim
good I-claim
people I-claim
always I-claim
get I-claim
an I-claim
happy I-claim
ending I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
do I-claim
n’t I-claim

think I-claim
it I-claim
’s I-claim
proper I-claim
. O

First O
, O
if B-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
story I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
way I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
boring I-premise
. O

If B-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
always I-premise
win I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
guess I-premise
the I-premise
ending I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
movies I-premise
or I-premise
dramas I-premise
. O

Then B-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
less I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
them I-premise
. O

But B-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
always I-premise
rewarded I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
the I-premise
movie I-premise
or I-premise
dramas I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
out I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
story I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Hollywood B-premise
stories I-premise
usually I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
happy I-premise
ending I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
hero I-premise
beats I-premise
a I-premise
crime I-premise
and I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
girl I-premise
. O

But B-premise
now I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
tired I-premise
with I-premise
it I-premise
. O

I B-premise
do I-premise
n’t I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
ending I-premise
again I-premise
and I-premise
again I-premise
. O

So O
we B-claim
ca I-claim
n’t I-claim
always I-claim
let I-claim
good I-claim
people I-claim
be I-claim
rewarded I-claim
in I-claim
movies I-claim
or I-claim
TV I-claim
programs I-claim
. O

Even B-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
bad I-premise
ending I-premise
sometimes I-premise
. O

And O
I O
think O
it B-premise
happen I-premise
more I-premise
often I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
those I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

So O
if B-claim
children I-claim
always I-claim
watch I-claim
the I-claim
TV I-claim
programs I-claim
that I-claim
good I-claim
people I-claim
get I-claim
rewarded I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
may I-claim
think I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
true I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
world I-claim
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
misleading I-premise
by I-premise
those I-premise
movies I-premise
. O

And O
they B-premise
may I-premise
act I-premise
like I-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
reward I-premise
. O

Once B-premise
they I-premise
find I-premise
the I-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
always I-premise
get I-premise
rewarded I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
feel I-premise
upset I-premise
and I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
person I-premise
. O

But O
in O
fact O
, O
the B-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
good I-premise
things I-premise
no I-premise
matter I-premise
the I-premise
ending I-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

So O
we B-premise
should I-premise
tell I-premise
this I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
avoid I-premise
the I-premise
misunderstanding I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
those B-premise
good I-premise
endings I-premise
sometimes I-premise
are I-premise
helpful I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
people I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
encouraged I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
good I-premise
things I-premise
. O

But O
like O
I O
said O
, O
this B-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
behavior I-premise
wo I-premise
n’t I-premise
last I-premise
long I-premise
, O
because O
someday B-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
realize I-premise
the I-premise
truth I-premise
. O

So O
I O
suggest O
we B-claim
should I-claim
show I-claim
people I-claim
the I-claim
truth I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
stories I-claim
. O

And O
if B-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
good I-premise
people I-premise
no I-premise
matter I-premise
how I-premise
the I-premise
story I-premise
ends I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
my O
arguments O
above O
, O
I O
think O
movies B-claim
and I-claim
TV I-claim
programs I-claim
should I-claim
present I-claim
different I-claim
stories I-claim
in I-claim
which I-claim
good I-claim
people I-claim
get I-claim
reward I-claim
or I-claim
get I-claim
nothing I-claim
. O

Should O
replace O
normal O
classroom O
with O
online O
computer O
classes O
? O

There O
are O
many O
advantages O
of O
distance O
learning O
, O
but O
it B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
replace I-claim
classroom I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

Learning B-premise
in I-premise
classroom I-premise
could I-premise
provide I-premise
more I-premise
information I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
learning B-premise
in I-premise
classroom I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
learning I-premise
academic I-premise
skills I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
learning I-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
learning I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
problem I-premise
in I-premise
real I-premise
situation I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
I B-claim
completely I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
this I-claim
statement I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
replace I-claim
normal I-claim
course I-claim
with I-claim
online I-claim
course I-claim
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
learning B-claim
in I-claim
classroom I-claim
could I-claim
provide I-claim
more I-claim
information I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
students I-claim
more I-claim
comprehend I-claim
in I-claim
subjects I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
had I-claim
learnt I-claim
. O

Because O
in B-premise
classroom I-premise
have I-premise
many I-premise
equipment I-premise
to I-premise
demonstrate I-premise
real I-premise
example I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
biology I-premise
class I-premise
, I-premise
learning I-premise
anatomy I-premise
by I-premise
operating I-premise
fog I-premise
have I-premise
many I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

Learner B-premise
could I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
tools I-premise
and I-premise
see I-premise
actual I-premise
organs I-premise
of I-premise
fog I-premise
. O

Unlike O
classroom O
, O
online B-premise
class I-premise
just I-premise
only I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
textbook I-premise
not I-premise
learnin I-premise
real I-premise
situation I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
online B-claim
class I-claim
could I-claim
not I-claim
provide I-claim
knowledge I-claim
about I-claim
social I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
In B-premise
a I-premise
classroom I-premise
, I-premise
teacher I-premise
could I-premise
give I-premise
assignment I-premise
to I-premise
student I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
. O

This B-premise
could I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
collaborate I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
group I-premise
. O

This B-premise
important I-premise
skill I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
gotten I-premise
in I-premise
online I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
learning B-claim
in I-claim
classroom I-claim
, I-claim
student I-claim
could I-claim
have I-claim
healthier I-claim
life I-claim
because O
in B-premise
school I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
exercise I-premise
class I-premise
which I-premise
train I-premise
student I-premise
to I-premise
move I-premise
their I-premise
body I-premise
. O

Classroom B-premise
have I-premise
specialist I-premise
trainer I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
it I-premise
right I-premise
way I-premise
. O

If B-premise
student I-premise
do I-premise
it I-premise
by I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
hurt I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

This B-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
healthier I-premise
life I-premise
which I-premise
online I-premise
class I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
provide I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
personally I-claim
disagree I-claim
this I-claim
this I-claim
notion I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
should I-claim
replace I-claim
classroom I-claim
with I-claim
online I-claim
class I-claim
. O

Because O
, O
classroom B-premise
could I-premise
provide I-premise
real I-premise
actual I-premise
example I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
more I-premise
understand I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
subject I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
classroom B-premise
courses I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
provide I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
social I-premise
skill I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
classroom B-premise
could I-premise
provide I-premise
exercise I-premise
class I-premise
to I-premise
set I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
having B-claim
classroom I-claim
could I-claim
provide I-claim
abundant I-claim
skills I-claim
to I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Experiences O
that O

shaped O
your O
outlook O

the O
way O
you O
live O

Many B-claim
circumstances I-claim
that I-claim
I I-claim
experienced I-claim
change I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
I I-claim
think I-claim
. O

There B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
experiences I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
improve I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
way I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
could I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
solve I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
improve I-premise
how I-premise
I I-premise
take I-premise

and I-premise
improve I-premise
to I-premise
plan I-premise
my I-premise
life I-premise
for I-premise
future I-premise
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
studying B-claim
in I-claim
university I-claim
taught I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
prudent I-claim
person I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
math I-premise
class I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
learnt I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
an I-premise
answer I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
step I-premise
by I-premise
step I-premise
. O

Start B-premise
with I-premise
find I-premise
cause I-premise
of I-premise
problem I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
research I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
the I-premise
problem I-premise
. O

I B-premise
could I-premise
adapt I-premise
this I-premise
method I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
my I-premise
real I-premise
life I-premise
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
somewhere I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
to I-premise
destination I-premise
. O

Which B-premise
ways I-premise
are I-premise
shortest I-premise
and I-premise
which I-premise
ways I-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
consume I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise
. O

I B-premise
could I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
Some B-claim
experiences I-claim
could I-claim
teach I-claim
me I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
care I-claim
of I-claim
myself I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
reading B-premise
and I-premise
listening I-premise
the I-premise
news I-premise
about I-premise
choosing I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
diet I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
myself I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
healthy I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I B-premise
am I-premise
always I-premise
buy I-premise
a I-premise
quality I-premise
food I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
organic I-premise
food I-premise
. O

This B-premise
food I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
chemical I-premise
. O

So O
that O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
health I-premise
. O

This B-premise
experience I-premise
teach I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
aware I-premise
my I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
experiences B-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
change I-claim
to I-claim
plan I-claim
for I-claim
my I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
read I-premise
about I-premise
saving I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
retire I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
plan I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
I B-premise
start I-premise
changing I-premise
myself I-premise
from I-premise
spending I-premise
many I-premise
thing I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
saving I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
entire I-premise
life I-premise
. O

This B-premise
experience I-premise
change I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
concern I-premise
about I-premise
making I-premise
plan I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
future I-premise
life I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
experiences B-claim
that I-claim
shape I-claim
my I-claim
thinking I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
are I-claim
teach I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
person I-claim
. O

Because O
I B-premise
could I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
experiences B-premise
could I-premise
shape I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
aware I-premise
about I-premise
my I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
these B-premise
experiences I-premise
could I-premise
make I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
plan I-premise
for I-premise
my I-premise
future I-premise
life I-premise
. O

These B-claim
experiences I-claim
taught I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
change I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
person I-claim
. O

One O
important O
thing O
that O
I O
want O
to O
change O
about O
my O
hometown O
Public O
utilities O
and O
surroundings O
are O
the O
primary O
factors O
which O
we O
basically O
consider O
before O
we O
decide O
to O
live O
in O
a O
place O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
community O
which O
can O
perfectly O
meet O
our O
requirements O
. O

In O
my O
hometown O
, O
there O
are O
almost O
complete O
public O
utilities O
for O
one O
’s O
needs O
but O
transportation O
. O

So O
the B-claim
thing I-claim
that I-claim
I I-claim
really I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
change I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
. O

Since O
I B-claim
’m I-claim
facing I-claim
the I-claim
traffic I-claim
congestion I-claim
every I-claim
day I-claim
. O

And O
this O
problem O
seem O
to O
get O
worst O
. O

At O
first O
, O
it B-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
alternatives I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
subway I-claim
train I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
sky I-claim
train I-claim
. O

Hence O
, O
people B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
ways I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
. O

Since O
now B-premise
buses I-premise
are I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
community I-premise
, O
It B-premise
makes I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
area I-premise
have I-premise
no I-premise
choice I-premise
. O

They B-premise
must I-premise
take I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
bus I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
another I-premise
place I-premise
. O

If B-premise
a I-premise
subway I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
sky I-premise
train I-premise
are I-premise
available I-premise
here I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
convenience I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
people B-premise
can I-premise
estimate I-premise
time I-premise
from I-premise
taking I-premise
a I-premise
subway I-premise
train I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
train I-premise
schedule I-premise
. O

On B-premise
the I-premise
contrary I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
do I-premise
so I-premise
in I-premise
case I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
bus I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
this B-claim
improvement I-claim
will I-claim
decrease I-claim
a I-claim
bad I-claim
traffic I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
road I-claim
indirectly I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-premise
buses I-premise
provide I-premise
merely I-premise
two I-premise
routes I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
community I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
absolutely I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
problem I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
I I-premise
intend I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
route I-premise
of I-premise
buses I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
still I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
bus I-premise
that I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
bring I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
destination I-premise
but I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
center I-premise
station I-premise
first I-premise
to I-premise
exchange I-premise
to I-premise
another I-premise
bus I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

They B-claim
should I-claim
increase I-claim
more I-claim
routes I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
transport I-claim
more I-claim
easily I-claim
. O

Lastly O
, O
having B-premise
more I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
can I-premise
dwindle I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
using I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
cars I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
it O
provides O
many O
advantages O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people B-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
their I-premise
expenses I-premise
form I-premise
gasoline I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
nowadays I-premise
is I-premise
getting I-premise
more I-premise
expensive I-premise
. O

The B-claim
necessary I-claim
energy I-claim
will I-claim
slowly I-claim
be I-claim
used I-claim
up I-claim
, O
since O
people B-premise
use I-premise
less I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
cars I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
the B-claim
transportation I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
elementary I-claim
factor I-claim
which I-claim
directly I-claim
affects I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
’s I-claim
living I-claim
. O

I O
wish O
one O
day O
this O
problem O
would O
be O
changed O
. O

And O
then O
, O
the O
transportation O
in O
my O
hometown O
is O
no O
longer O
difficult O
for O
everyone O
in O
this O
community O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
a O
large O
company O
Companies O
vary O
from O
small O
to O
large O
ones O
based O
on O
the O
context O
, O
success O
and O
needs O
of O
their O
work O
. O

Small O
companies O
usually O
have O
a O
local O
job O
in O
the O
area O
, O
while O
large O
companies O
work O
in O
an O
international O
context O
providing O
for O
the O
entire O
nation O
or O
even O
for O
other O
foreign O
countries O
. O

I B-claim
personally I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
company I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
to B-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
company I-claim
is I-claim
way I-claim
more I-claim
easier I-claim
than I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
company I-claim
. O

Large B-premise
companies I-premise
always I-premise
look I-premise
for I-premise
new I-premise
skilled I-premise
employees I-premise
to I-premise
fill I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
need I-premise
of I-premise
distributing I-premise
, I-premise
managing I-premise
and I-premise
selling I-premise
their I-premise
products I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
company I-premise
decides I-premise
to I-premise
open I-premise
a I-premise
branch I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
need I-premise
more I-premise
employees I-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
country I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
there I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
Large B-premise
company I-premise
equals I-premise
more I-premise
job I-premise
opportunity I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
I O
think O
that O
a B-claim
large I-claim
company I-claim
can I-claim
give I-claim
better I-claim
salaries I-claim
than I-claim
a I-claim
smaller I-claim
one I-claim
. O

The B-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
company I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
one I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
considerable I-premise
success I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
this B-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
company I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
more I-premise
salaries I-premise
to I-premise
its I-premise
employees I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
common B-premise
sense I-premise
would I-premise
tell I-premise
us I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
famous I-premise
and I-premise
international I-premise
known I-premise
company I-premise
wo I-premise
n't I-premise
give I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
salary I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
local I-premise
company I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
I O
love O
travelling O
around O
the O
world O
. O

large B-claim
companies I-claim
have I-claim
an I-claim
international I-claim
reputation I-claim
, I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
organize I-claim
international I-claim
conferences I-claim
, I-claim
meetings I-claim
and I-claim
workshops I-claim
which I-claim
will I-claim
give I-claim
me I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
travel I-claim
in I-claim
different I-claim
countries I-claim
and I-claim
meet I-claim
new I-claim
people I-claim
. O

As B-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
learning I-premise
new I-premise
skills I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
field I-premise
from I-premise
these I-premise
workshops I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
i O
can O
certainly O
state O
that O
I B-claim
would I-claim
rather I-claim
prefer I-claim
working I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
company I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
one I-claim
. O

I B-claim
have I-claim
different I-claim
reasons I-claim
to I-claim
hold I-claim
that I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
having I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
work I-claim
, I-claim
having I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
salary I-claim
and I-claim
having I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
travel I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
to I-claim
attend I-claim
international I-claim
conferences I-claim
. O

Higher O
education O
should O
be O
available O
only O
to O
good O
students O
or O
not O

No O
one O
can O
disagree O
that O
knowledge O
is O
the O
most O
important O
for O
everyone O
. O

College O
and O
university O
are O
playing O
in O
an O
important O
role O
to O
provide O
academic O
skills O
to O
people O
in O
order O
to O
pursue O
their O
goal O
. O

There O
are O
an O
issue O
that O
some O
people O
agree O
that O
this O
opportunity O
should O
be O
preserved O
for O
good O
students O
however O
there O
are O
others O
people O
who O
think O
that O
everyone O
should O
have O
this O
chance O
to O
gain O
these O
advance O
skills O
from O
college O
or O
university O
. O

This O
issue O
will O
be O
discussed O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many O
people O
think O
that O
college B-claim
and I-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
consider I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
with I-claim
them I-claim
only I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
good I-claim
students I-claim
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
studying B-premise
in I-premise
advance I-premise
education I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

College B-premise
and I-premise
university I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
not I-premise
qualify I-premise
for I-premise
to I-premise
waste I-premise
their I-premise
money I-premise
in I-premise
these I-premise
expensive I-premise
courses I-premise
and I-premise
waste I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
. O

They O
believe O
that O
only B-premise
good I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
potentials I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
programs I-premise
more I-premise
that I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
considered I-premise
as I-premise
good I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
mediocre B-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
gain I-premise
these I-premise
advance I-premise
knowledge I-premise
from I-premise
college I-premise
and I-premise
university I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O

some O
people O
think O
that O
all B-premise
students I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
equal I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
higher I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
, O
higher B-premise
education I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
however O
moderate B-premise
students I-premise
should I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
. O

Everyone B-premise
that I-premise
has I-premise
strongly I-premise
ambition I-premise
could I-premise
pursue I-premise
and I-premise
success I-premise
their I-premise
goal I-premise
even I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
classified I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
student I-premise
because I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
change I-premise
. O

With B-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
environment I-premise
in I-premise
college I-premise
or I-premise
university I-premise
is I-premise
encouraging I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
harder I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
mediocre B-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
trained I-claim
in I-claim
college I-claim
and I-claim
university I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
agree O
with O
that O
college B-claim
and I-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
available I-claim
for I-claim
all I-claim
students I-claim
who I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
pursue I-claim
their I-claim
goal I-claim
. O

Students B-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
practice I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
gain I-claim
more I-claim
knowledge I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
career I-claim
and I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Studying B-claim
in I-claim
college I-claim
and I-claim
university I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
opportunity I-claim
that I-claim
all I-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
. O

Disagree O
Playing O
Computer O
Games O
wastes O
time O
and O
students O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
! O

It O
is O
a O
debatable O
subject O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
play I-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
since O
playing B-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
a I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
. O

I O
hold O
a O
positive O
view O
against O
this O
opinion O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
a B-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
obsessed I-claim
in I-claim
on I-claim
- I-claim
line I-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
and I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
result I-claim
their I-claim
performance I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
are I-claim
declined I-claim
. O

An B-premise
investigation I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
Beijing I-premise
University I-premise
shows I-premise
that I-premise
80 I-premise
% I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
failed I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
final I-premise
exam I-premise
paid I-premise
2 I-premise
hours I-premise
or I-premise
more I-premise
on I-premise
- I-premise
online I-premise
games I-premise
every I-premise
week I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
90 I-premise
% I-premise
excellent I-premise
students I-premise
expressed I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
touch I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
days I-premise
. O

Recent B-premise
research I-premise
by I-premise
Scientist I-premise
also I-premise
reveals I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
youngs I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
attacted I-premise
by I-premise
and I-premise
lose I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
these I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
low I-premise
control I-premise
ability I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
children B-premise
could I-premise
learn I-premise
nothing I-premise
from I-premise
these I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
, O
therefore O
time B-claim
on I-claim
this I-claim
activity I-claim
is I-claim
really I-claim
time I-claim
wasting I-claim
. O

Since O
all B-premise
these I-premise
games I-premise
are I-premise
developed I-premise
for I-premise
commercial I-premise
purpose I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
catch I-premise
the I-premise
eyes I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
, O
majority B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
games I-premise
use I-premise
war I-premise
, I-premise
violence I-premise
, I-premise
bloody I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
sexual I-premise
subjects I-premise
to I-premise
lure I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
. O

However O
, O
those B-premise
subjects I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
suitable I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
will I-premise
bring I-premise
bad I-premise
effects I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
youths I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim

a I-claim
few I-claim
students I-claim
paying I-claim
considerable I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
playing I-claim
finally I-claim
choose I-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
related I-claim
jobs I-claim
as I-claim
their I-claim
career I-claim
. O

But O
we O
have O
to O
realize O
the O
fact O
: O
majority B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
failed I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
playing I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
use I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
studying I-premise
, I-premise
sleeping I-premise
and I-premise
physical I-premise
exerice I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
these I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
uncommon I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
teenages I-premise
are I-premise
found I-premise
sleepless I-premise
for I-premise
several I-premise
days I-premise
playing I-premise
on I-premise
- I-premise
line I-premise
games I-premise
at I-premise
public I-premise
internet I-premise
bar I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
some I-premise
media I-premise
reports I-premise
regarding I-premise
the I-premise
sudden I-premise
death I-premise
case I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
teenages I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
bar I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
it B-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
that I-claim
children I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
play I-claim
the I-claim
computer I-claim
games I-claim
. O

The O
computer O
games O
are O
like O
cigerate O
to O
adults O
and O
we O
need O
to O
set O
up O
rules O
to O
regulate O
this O
area O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
classmates O
or O
colleagues O
should O
work O
on O
projects O
in O
person O
or O
by O
e O
- O
mail O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
question O
whether O
classmates O
or O
colleagues O
should O
work O
on O
projects O
in O
person O
or O
by O
email O
, O
I O
am O
of O
the O
view O
that O
wok B-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
is I-claim
preferred I-claim
because O
this B-claim
means I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
team B-premise
members I-premise
may I-premise
have I-premise
different I-premise
views I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
a I-premise
union I-premise
opinion I-premise
efficiently I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
discussion B-claim
face I-claim
to I-claim
face I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
meeting I-claim
is I-claim
much I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
by I-claim
emails I-claim
. O

An B-premise
experiment I-premise
conducted I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
Beijing I-premise
University I-premise
asked I-premise
two I-premise
groups I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
the I-premise
budget I-premise
of I-premise
an I-premise
activity I-premise
. O

The B-premise
first I-premise
group I-premise
was I-premise
asked I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
in I-premise
person I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
the I-premise
second I-premise
group I-premise
was I-premise
asked I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
by I-premise
email I-premise
. O

The O
result O
shows O
that O
the B-premise
1st I-premise
group I-premise
used I-premise
30 I-premise
minutes I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
the I-premise
agreement I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
budget I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
it I-premise
takes I-premise
30 I-premise
hours I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
later I-premise
one I-premise
. O

The B-premise
similar I-premise
experiment I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
other I-premise
scientist I-premise
show I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
result I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
reach I-premise
an I-premise
agreement I-premise
quickly I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
work B-premise
in I-premise
person I-premise
can I-premise
indirectly I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
efficiency I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
project I-premise
because O
there B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
less I-premise
conflicts I-premise
or I-premise
fight I-premise
amongst I-premise
the I-premise
team I-premise
members I-premise
. O

Writing B-premise
an I-premise
email I-premise
for I-premise
an I-premise
informal I-premise
matter I-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
that I-premise
matter I-premise
looks I-premise
official I-premise
, O
therefore O
people B-premise
who I-premise
receives I-premise
the I-premise
email I-premise
may I-premise
feel I-premise
nervous I-premise
or I-premise
maybe I-premise
feel I-premise
offended I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
words I-premise
in I-premise
writing I-premise
. O

While O
if B-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
words I-premise
are I-premise
expressed I-premise
in I-premise
talking I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
counterparty I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
more I-premise
relaxed I-premise
since O
their B-premise
response I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
recorded I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
misunderstand I-premise
the I-premise
informal I-premise
discussion I-premise
to I-premise
an I-premise
official I-premise
claim I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
less B-claim
misunderstanding I-claim
leads I-claim
to I-claim
less I-claim
conflicts I-claim
and I-claim
fights I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
enhance I-claim
the I-claim
communication I-claim
amongst I-claim
the I-claim
team I-claim
members I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
sometimes B-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
emails I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
team I-premise
members I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
located I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
place I-premise
. O

Although O
emails B-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
convenient I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
work I-claim
but I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
none I-claim
. O

Since O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
classroom I-premise
or I-premise
campus I-premise
projects I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
few I-premise
possibility I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
project I-premise
members I-premise
are I-premise
located I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
areas I-premise
. O

While O
we B-claim
should I-claim
realize I-claim
that I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
project I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
numerous I-claim
coordination I-claim
works I-claim
are I-claim
required I-claim
, I-claim
if I-claim
each I-claim
opinion I-claim
is I-claim
communicated I-claim
via I-claim
email I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
hundreds I-claim
or I-claim
thousands I-claim
of I-claim
emails I-claim
there I-claim
that I-claim
we I-claim
know I-claim
this I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
experience I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
the I-claim
project I-claim
members I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
rather I-claim
them I-claim
by I-claim
email I-claim
because O
work B-claim
in I-claim
person I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
efficient I-claim
. O

Professors O
should O
do O
more O
research O
or O
teach O
students O
? O

These O
days O
, O
more O
and O
more O
university O
professors O
are O
involved O
in O
scientific O
research O
. O

Some O
are O
afraid O
that O
this O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
decline O
of O
education O
quality O
and O
suggest O
them O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
teaching O

However O
, O
according O
to O
my O
experiences O
, O
professors B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
encouraged I-claim
to I-claim
mainly I-claim
do I-claim
research I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
doing B-premise
research I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
method I-premise
of I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
improvement I-premise
for I-premise
professors I-premise
. O

Universities B-premise
are I-premise
relatively I-premise
fenced I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

The B-premise
research I-premise
projects I-premise
provide I-premise
communication I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
outside I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
by B-premise
doing I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
professors I-premise
could I-premise
catch I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
latest I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
technologies I-premise
. O

I B-premise
still I-premise
remembered I-premise
that I-premise
my I-premise
professor I-premise
took I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
several I-premise
research I-premise
projects I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
college I-premise
. O

He B-premise
was I-premise
often I-premise
invited I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
speech I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

Although O
my B-premise
university I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
high I-premise
- I-premise
ranking I-premise
list I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
gained I-premise
a I-premise
reputation I-premise
by I-premise
those I-premise
projects I-premise
. O

The B-claim
research I-claim
projects I-claim
like I-claim
windows I-claim
opened I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
wider I-claim
world I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
professors B-claim
should I-claim
fully I-claim
use I-claim
the I-claim
research I-claim
- I-claim
friendly I-claim
environment I-claim
provided I-claim
by I-claim
universities I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
common I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
state I-premise
- I-premise
of I-premise
- I-premise
the I-premise
- I-premise
art I-premise
laboratories I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
campus I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
you B-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
find I-premise
another I-premise
place I-premise
with I-premise
so I-premise
much I-premise
talent I-premise
people I-premise
gathering I-premise
together I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
really I-premise
no I-premise
reason I-premise
to I-premise
discourage I-premise
professors I-premise
from I-premise
using I-premise
those I-premise
advantages I-premise
. O

We B-premise
all I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
Einstein I-premise
developed I-premise
the I-premise
theory I-premise
of I-premise
general I-premise
relativity I-premise
when I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
professor I-premise
in I-premise
HU I-premise
Berlin I-premise
. O

Universities B-premise
positively I-premise
contribute I-premise
the I-premise
professors I-premise
' I-premise
success I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
doing B-claim
research I-claim
could I-claim
also I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
teaching I-claim
quality I-claim
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
research I-premise
projects I-premise
, I-premise
professors I-premise
could I-premise
lead I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
practical I-premise
world I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
classroom I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
teach I-premise
students I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
imply I-premise
the I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
practice I-premise
. O

I B-premise
still I-premise
remembered I-premise
the I-premise
experience I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
an I-premise
assistant I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
professor I-premise
's I-premise
research I-premise
project I-premise
. O

By B-premise
participating I-premise
in I-premise
it I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
opportunities I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
theories I-premise
on I-premise
textbooks I-premise
in I-premise
real I-premise
life I-premise
experiments I-premise
. O

The B-premise
research I-premise
project I-premise
provides I-premise
a I-premise
more I-premise
efficient I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
teaching I-premise
. O

For O
those O
reasons O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
natural I-claim
to I-claim
support I-claim
the I-claim
professors I-claim
spending I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
doing I-claim
research I-claim
. O

While B-claim
extending I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
development I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
outcomes I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
researches I-claim
will I-claim
also I-claim
benefit I-claim
the I-claim
whole I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Learning O
with O
a O
teacher O
is O
more O
efficient O
than O
by O
myself O
. O

Every O
person O
learn O
in O
their O
own O
manner O
which O
they O
think O
that O
is O
most O
expedient O
to O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
learning O
by O
yourself O
, O
it O
has O
some O
certain O
profit O
. O

It O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
concentrate O
on O
what O
you O
learn O
cause O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
distracts O
your O
attention O
in O
presence O
of O
you O
, O
and O
your O
learning O
becomes O
more O
profound O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
learning O
with O
a O
teacher O
makes O
us O
bear O
more O
burdens O
of O
studies O
cause O
they O
assign O
us O
homework O
, O
Nevertheless O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
learn I-claim
by I-claim
myself I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
The O
distinguishing O
fact O
of O
the O
learning B-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
is I-claim
that I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
ask I-claim
about I-claim
problems I-claim
related I-claim
your I-claim
studies I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
when B-premise
we I-premise
encounter I-premise
difficulty I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
study I-premise
which I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
make I-premise
out I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
asking I-premise
the I-premise
difficulty I-premise
from I-premise
our I-premise
teacher I-premise
is I-premise
propitious I-premise
way I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
it I-premise
instantly I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
professors B-premise
and I-premise
teachers I-premise
have I-premise
much I-premise
experience I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
dextrous I-premise
with I-premise
letting I-premise
students I-premise
understand I-premise
their I-premise
study I-premise
. O

They B-premise
know I-premise
something I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
incorporated I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
materials I-premise
as I-premise
books I-premise
and I-premise
webpages I-premise
. O

Hence O
I B-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
class I-premise
, I-premise
often I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
teacher I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
coordinated I-premise
answer I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
my I-premise
faced I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
my I-premise
classmates I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
accustomed I-premise
to I-premise
communicating I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
teacher I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
the B-claim
learning I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
efficient I-claim
than I-claim
by I-claim
myself I-claim
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
accomplish I-premise
our I-premise
assignments I-premise
with I-premise
little I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
teacher I-premise
within I-premise
less I-premise
time I-premise
than I-premise
do I-premise
it I-premise
by I-premise
ourself I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
teachers I-premise
play I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
leading I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
right I-premise
direction I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
This B-premise
gives I-premise
us I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
rise I-premise
our I-premise
educational I-premise
level I-premise
to I-premise
an I-premise
exited I-premise
degree I-premise
. O

knowledge B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
thereby I-premise
better I-premise
improved I-premise
and I-premise
strengthened I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
of O
course O
, O
being B-claim
without I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
has I-claim
shortcomings I-claim
. O

Notable O
one O
of O
the O
shortcomings O
is O
that O
if B-premise
someone I-premise
faced I-premise
so I-premise
complicated I-premise
confusion I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
study I-premise
and I-premise
his I-premise
many I-premise
endeavors I-premise
on I-premise
making I-premise
out I-premise
it I-premise
were I-premise
miscarried I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
ended I-premise
in I-premise
disappointment I-premise
. O

I O
think O
that O
for B-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
depends I-premise
on I-premise
only I-premise
himself I-premise
in I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
improvement I-premise
of I-premise
ability I-premise
, I-premise
with I-premise
regard I-premise
to I-premise
cooperation I-premise
and I-premise
express I-premise
his I-premise
opinion I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
unpromising I-premise
. O

Hence O
I B-claim
support I-claim
this I-claim
point I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
learning I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
. O

Technology O
designed O
to O
make O
people O
's O
lives O
simpler O
often O
make O
them O
more O
complicated O
Many O
people O
think O
they O
are O
blessed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
era O
of O
high O
technology O
. O

With O
newly O
developing O
technologies O
, O
people O
are O
able O
to O
carry O
various O
tasks O
more O
convenient O
and O
easy O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
to O
travel O
to O
DMV O
to O
renew O
our O
driver O
's O
license O
or O
drive O
to O
bank O
for O
sending O
money O
. O

Ancient O
people O
would O
probably O
think O
that O
we O
are O
like O
magicians O
. O

However O
, O
even O
with O
all O
the O
conveniences O
, O
we O
would O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
technologies B-claim
made I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
more I-claim
complicated I-claim
. O

There O
are O
couple O
reasons O
and O
examples O
to O
support O
my O
answer O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
new B-claim
technologies I-claim
are I-claim
always I-claim
great I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
takes I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
adapt I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Since O
we B-premise
are I-premise
informed I-premise
with I-premise
devices I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
produced I-premise
with I-premise
new I-premise
features I-premise
nearly I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
, O
many B-premise
people I-premise
often I-premise
get I-premise
lost I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
use I-premise
new I-premise
Iphone I-premise
which I-premise
I I-premise
personally I-premise
think I-premise
is I-premise
great I-premise
. O

However O
, O
even B-premise
though I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
it I-premise
for I-premise
couple I-premise
months I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
still I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
features I-premise
proficiently I-premise
. O

At O
first O
, O
I B-premise
tried I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
through I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
instructions I-premise
but I-premise
, I-premise
soon I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
gave I-premise
up I-premise
because O
I B-premise
found I-premise
out I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
time I-premise
- I-premise
consuming I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
too I-premise
many I-premise
things I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
. O

Next O
, O
technology B-claim
destroys I-claim
the I-claim
language I-claim
. O

Ever O
since O
people B-premise
used I-premise
computers I-premise
or I-premise
cellphones I-premise
to I-premise
chat I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
, O
they B-premise
created I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
language I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
. O

Because O
people B-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
type I-premise
as I-premise
fast I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
talking I-premise
, O
they B-premise
use I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
abbreviations I-premise
and I-premise
broken I-premise
language I-premise
. O

This B-premise
has I-premise
gotten I-premise
worse I-premise
with I-premise
twitter I-premise
, I-premise
myspace I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
facebook I-premise
. O

What B-premise
are I-premise
even I-premise
worse I-premise
, I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
early I-premise
ages I-premise
are I-premise
exposed I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
impeded I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
newly I-premise
developed I-premise
inventions I-premise
. O

To O
clarify O
, O
my B-premise
younger I-premise
brother I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
spell I-premise
the I-premise
words I-premise
correctly I-premise
and I-premise
he I-premise
talks I-premise
to I-premise
his I-premise
friends I-premise
with I-premise
terms I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
never I-premise
heard I-premise
of I-premise
. O

I B-premise
have I-premise
tried I-premise
to I-premise
correct I-premise
him I-premise
for I-premise
couple I-premise
times I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
just I-premise
thinks I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
too I-premise
conservative I-premise
. O

Although O
technologies B-claim
allowed I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
convenient I-claim
life I-claim
, O
it B-claim
has I-claim
made I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
more I-claim
chaotic I-claim
according I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
reasons I-claim
mentioned I-claim
above I-claim
. O

Classroom O

online O

There O
are O
some O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
distance O

online O

replace O

while O
there O

some O

strongly O
disagree O
with O
this O
opinion O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
online B-claim
classes I-claim
should I-claim
never I-claim
replace I-claim
classroom I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

I O
list O
my O
reasons O
as O
follows O
. O

First O
, O
indeed O
classroom B-claim
learning I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
education I-claim
comparing I-claim
to I-claim
online I-claim
classes I-claim
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
classroom I-premise
environment I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
from I-premise
your I-premise
classmates I-premise
, O
because O
if B-premise
you I-premise
see I-premise
any I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise
classmates I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
performing I-premise
better I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
force I-premise
you I-premise
for I-premise
making I-premise
your I-premise
performance I-premise
more I-premise
better I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
When B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
First I-premise
Year I-premise
in I-premise
B I-premise
Com I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
serious I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
study I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
saw I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
who I-premise
took I-premise
better I-premise
grades I-premise
than I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
influenced I-premise
me I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
intended I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
better I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

Finally O
I B-premise
got I-premise
1st I-premise
rank I-premise
in I-premise
final I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
in B-premise
classroom I-premise
learning I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
complete I-premise
study I-premise
work I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
. O

It B-claim
makes I-claim
you I-claim
perfect I-claim
in I-claim
time I-claim
management I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

Moreover O
you B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
by I-premise
participating I-premise
in I-premise
group I-premise
studies I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

It B-premise
makes I-premise
you I-premise
communication I-premise
and I-premise
of I-premise
course I-premise
your I-premise
group I-premise
skills I-premise
better I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
you I-premise
in I-premise
your I-premise
future I-premise
and I-premise
career I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
professors B-premise
play I-premise
vital I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
classroom I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
specialists I-premise
is I-premise
their I-premise
subjects I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
help I-premise
you I-premise
by I-premise
giving I-premise
valuable I-premise
information I-premise
and I-premise
useful I-premise
skills I-premise

You B-premise
can I-premise
improve I-premise
your I-premise

by I-premise
work I-premise
under I-premise
any I-premise
professor I-premise
; I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
ask I-premise
questions I-premise
face I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
clear I-premise
your I-premise
doubts I-premise
. O

In O
result O
you B-claim
learn I-claim
quickly I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
have O
my O
personal O
experience O
. O

For B-premise
Toefl I-premise
IBT I-premise
Coaching I-premise
first I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
some I-premise
online I-premise
courses I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
after I-premise
1 I-premise
month I-premise
I I-premise
realized I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
wasting I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise

so I-premise
I I-premise
joined I-premise
an I-premise
institute I-premise
for I-premise
preparation I-premise
of I-premise
Toefl I-premise
IBT I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
1 I-premise
month I-premise
I I-premise
felt I-premise
that I-premise
my I-premise
English I-premise
skills I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
improving I-premise
faster I-premise
. O

It O
's O
undeniable O
that O
online B-claim
classes I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
so I-claim
they I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
used I-claim
as I-claim
supplementary I-claim
, O
but O
they B-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
substitute I-premise
of I-premise
existing I-premise
classroom I-premise
learning I-premise
. O

From O
the O
discussed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
easily O
draw O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the B-claim
classroom I-claim
learning I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
education I-claim
for I-claim
these I-claim
reasons I-claim
. O

Part O
time O
job O
for O
teenage O
students O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
student O
, O
we O
generally O
mean O
a O
boy O
or O
a O
girl O
who O
study O
in O
school O
or O
college O
. O

In O
some O
country O
, O
teenage O
students O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
do O
some O
part O
time O
job O
beside O
their O
study O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
do O
not O
support O
the O
concept O
of O
teenagers O
doing O
job O
beside O
study O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
teenager I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
a I-claim
part I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
while I-claim
he I-claim
/ I-claim
she I-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
a I-claim
student I-claim
and O
this O
is O
for O
two O
reasons O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
is O
that O
students B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
things I-claim
from I-claim
part I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
, I-claim
before I-claim
starting I-claim
their I-claim
real I-claim
job I-claim
. O

Students B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
time I-premise
management I-premise
, I-premise
money I-premise
management I-premise
and I-premise
convince I-premise
people I-premise
by I-premise
their I-premise
words I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
I I-premise
worked I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
sales I-premise
- I-premise
man I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
shop I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
year I-premise
. O

As B-premise
i I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
job I-premise
, O
therefore O
, O
i B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise
efficiently I-premise
. O

I B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
my I-premise
boss I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
my I-premise
homework I-premise
. O

This B-premise
taught I-premise
me I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
time I-premise
efficiently I-premise
and I-premise
do I-premise
any I-premise
job I-premise
quickly I-premise
and I-premise
effectively I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
I B-premise
learn I-premise
money I-premise
management I-premise
. O

When B-premise
my I-premise
boss I-premise
was I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
shop I-premise
, I-premise
i I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
the I-premise
accounts I-premise
section I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
shop I-premise
. O

From B-premise
this I-premise
i I-premise
learned I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
money I-premise
correctly I-premise
. O

This B-premise
experience I-premise
taught I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
doing I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
many I-premise
things I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
from B-claim
part I-claim
time I-claim
jobs I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
earn I-claim
money I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when O
i O
was O
in O
high O
school O
I O
worked O
as O
a O
home O
tutor O
. O

I O
taught O
math O
to O
two O
kids O
of O
my O
neighbor O
. O

I O
helped O
them O
to O
understand O
the O
difficult O
topics O
of O
the O
books O
. O

By B-premise
tutoring I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
i I-premise
earned I-premise
some I-premise
money I-premise
and I-premise
bought I-premise
me I-premise
books I-premise
with I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
after B-premise
taking I-premise
that I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
i I-premise
stopped I-premise
taking I-premise
my I-premise
pocket I-premise
money I-premise
form I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
part B-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
earn I-premise
money I-premise
and I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
financially I-premise
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
; O
some O
people O
will O
oppose O
the O
idea O
of O
part O
time O
job O
for O
students O
. O

They O
will O
argue O
, O
it B-claim
can I-claim
destruct I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
study I-claim
. O

However O
, O
as O
i B-premise
did I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise

and I-premise
it I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
hurt I-premise
my I-premise
academic I-premise
result I-premise
; O
therefore O
, O
i O
believe O
part B-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
good I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Every O
Student O
should O
do O
part O
time O
job O
beside O
their O
study O
if O
they O
want O
to O
prepare O
more O
efficiently O
for O
their O
future O
. O

Which O
is O
better- O

Learning O
foreign O
language O
in O
home O
or O
host O
country O
? O

Our O
World O
has O
varied O
cultures O
and O
each O
culture O
has O
its O
own O
language O
. O

It O
has O
become O
essential O
for O
a O
person O
to O
learn O
at O
least O
one O
foreign O
language O
as O
one O
do O
interacts O
with O
foreigners O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
and O
learning O
a O
foreign O
langauge O
adds O
on O
to O
a O
person O
skill O
- O
set O
as O
well O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
think O
its B-claim
better I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
learn I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
country I-claim
. O

The O
reasons O
for O
holding O
that O
opinion O
are O
illustrated O
in O
the O
subsequent O
paragraphs O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
possible I-claim
for I-claim
everyone I-claim
to I-claim
visit I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
country I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
as O
it B-premise
requires I-premise
large I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
and I-premise
legal I-premise
formalities I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
earlier I-premise
periods I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
teacher I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
languge I-premise
. O

But O
with B-claim
the I-claim
advent I-claim
of I-claim
globalization I-claim
, I-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
easily I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
teacher I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
country I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
Indian I-premise
sub I-premise
- I-premise
continent I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
centers I-premise
opened I-premise
for I-premise
getting I-premise
trained I-premise
in I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
languages I-premise
like I-premise
french I-premise
, I-premise
german I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
colleges B-premise
and I-premise
universities I-premise
have I-premise
introduced I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
course I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
curriculum I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
can I-premise
choose I-premise
any I-premise
language I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
set I-premise
of I-premise
languages I-premise
available I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
. O

So O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
country I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
highly B-premise
qualified I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
teachers I-premise
are I-premise
easily I-premise
accessible I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
schools I-premise
and I-premise
colleges I-premise
. O

Third O
, O
technology B-claim
has I-claim
also I-claim
played I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
reducing I-claim
the I-claim
separation I-claim
between I-claim
learning I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
languge I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
country I-claim
. O

A B-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
courses I-premise
are I-premise
available I-premise
online I-premise
and I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
various I-premise
forums I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
discuss I-premise
their I-premise
problems I-premise
on I-premise
different I-premise
foreign I-premise
languages I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
country I-claim
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
cost I-claim
effective I-claim
and I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
pool I-claim
of I-claim
opportunities I-claim
available I-claim
now I-claim
to I-claim
accomplish I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
. O

One O
long O
vacation O
or O
several O
long O
vacation O

Everybody O
require O
some O
break O
from O
their O
tight O
schedules O
likewise O
students O
also O
require O
vacation O
form O
their O
intense O
academic O
schedules O
. O

Many O
people O
promote O
one O
long O
vacation O
system O
of O
the O
school O
because O
it O
would O
help O
student O
to O
start O
their O
course O
or O
academic O
year O
with O
strong O
zeal O
of O
learning O
. O

So O
other O
several O
, O
prefer O
numbers O
of O
short O
breaks O
during O
the O
year O
so O
that O
student O
can O
get O
rejuvenate O
periodically O
. O

In O
both O
the O
scenario O
students O
relief O
themselves O
. O

However O
, O
i B-claim
discern I-claim
that I-claim
several I-claim
small I-claim
breaks I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
active I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
academics I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
several B-claim
vacations I-claim
throughout I-claim
the I-claim
year I-claim
will I-claim
keep I-claim
stress I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
students I-claim
low I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
educational I-premise
bodies I-premise
schedule I-premise
its I-premise
small I-premise
vacations I-premise
after I-premise
term I-premise
exams I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
student I-premise
's I-premise
get I-premise
relief I-premise
form I-premise
exam I-premise
pressure I-premise
. O

However O
, O
research B-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
universities I-premise
proves I-premise
that I-premise
student I-premise
's I-premise
performance I-premise
improves I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
regular I-premise
breaks I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
preparation I-premise
and I-premise
examination I-premise
schedule I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
colleges I-premise
in I-premise
foreign I-premise
countries I-premise
provide I-premise
vacations I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
after I-premise
each I-premise
semester I-premise
that I-premise
facilitate I-premise
student I-premise
to I-premise
entertain I-premise
themselves I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
prepare I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
next I-premise
semester I-premise
. O

Also O
several B-premise
holidays I-premise
aid I-premise
these I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
amuse I-premise
themselves I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
arrange I-premise
fund I-premise
and I-premise
materials I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
books I-premise
and I-premise
references I-premise
material I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
upcoming I-premise
course I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
scientific O
research O
provide O
several O
authentic O
survey O
of O
the O
students O
' O
performance O
after O
break O
. O

It O
states O
that O
students B-claim
learning I-claim
capability I-claim
increase I-claim
after I-claim
having I-claim
refreshing I-claim
vacation I-claim
. O

To O
quote O
an O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
my I-premise
school I-premise
we I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
several I-premise
vacations I-premise
after I-premise
our I-premise
quarterly I-premise
exams I-premise
. O

During B-premise
those I-premise
vacations I-premise
i I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
analyze I-premise
my I-premise
performance I-premise
in I-premise
latest I-premise
examination I-premise
and I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
through I-premise
those I-premise
question I-premise
or I-premise
concept I-premise
again I-premise
to I-premise
avoid I-premise
making I-premise
same I-premise
mistakes I-premise
. O

I B-premise
also I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
my I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
developing I-premise
some I-premise
recreational I-premise
activity I-premise
or I-premise
learning I-premise
some I-premise
sports I-premise
or I-premise
game I-premise
. O

During B-premise
my I-premise
all I-premise
vacations I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
miss I-premise
my I-premise
school I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
which I-premise
I I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
restart I-premise
my I-premise
session I-premise
with I-premise
great I-premise
enthusiasm I-premise
of I-premise
learning I-premise
and I-premise
scoring I-premise
good I-premise
marks I-premise
in I-premise
new I-premise
quarter I-premise
. O

Vacations B-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
required I-claim
by I-claim
students I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
by I-claim
professionals I-claim
and I-claim
housekeepers I-claim
. O

As O
it B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
provide I-premise
break I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
regular I-premise
commitment I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
allows I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
some I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
themselves I-premise
, I-premise
heel I-premise
stressful I-premise
mind I-premise
and I-premise
boost I-premise
desire I-premise
of I-premise
resuming I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
regular I-premise
schedule I-premise
. O

Therefore O
schools B-claim
should I-claim
consider I-claim
giving I-claim
several I-claim
small I-claim
vocations I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
during I-claim
the I-claim
year I-claim
. O

Saving O
/ O
Spending O
money O

In O
recent O
years O
the O
majority O
of O
developed O
countries O
have O
a O
low O
saving O
rate O
because O
the O
people O
opt O
to O
spend O
their O
earnings O
immediately O
or O
they O
even O
take O
loans O
to O
finance O
their O
expenses O
. O

But O
is O
n't O
it O
better O
to O
save O
your O
money O
for O
later O
investments O
or O
rough O
times O
? O

I O
m O
my O
opinion O
, O
saving B-claim
some I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
your I-claim
earnings I-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
you B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
predict I-claim
future I-claim
developments I-claim
, I-claim
neither I-claim
in I-claim
your I-claim
professional I-claim
nor I-claim
your I-claim
personal I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
furthermore I-claim
with I-claim
savings I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
fulfill I-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
your I-claim
dreams I-claim
. O

First O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
several I-premise
uncertainties I-premise
about I-premise
your I-premise
professional I-premise
future I-premise
. O

The B-claim
global I-claim
economic I-claim
conditions I-claim
in I-claim
these I-claim
days I-claim
are I-claim
tough I-claim
and I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
unpredictable I-claim
factors I-claim
that I-claim
make I-claim
it I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
your I-claim
bank I-claim
account I-claim
. O

As O
example O
I B-premise
remember I-premise
some I-premise
friends I-premise
who I-premise
lost I-premise
their I-premise
jobs I-premise
recently I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
crisis I-premise
in I-premise
Europe I-premise
. O

Some O
of O
them O
had O
no O
own O
savings O
. O

They B-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
the I-premise
rent I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
move I-premise
back I-premise
in I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
families I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
lost I-premise
their I-premise
independence I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
sure I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
in I-premise
your I-premise
personal I-premise
life I-premise
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
possible I-claim
that I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
unavoidable I-claim
expenses I-claim
that I-claim
you I-claim
could I-claim
not I-claim
afford I-claim
without I-claim
savings I-claim
. O

Back B-premise
in I-premise
university I-premise
I I-premise
remember I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
of I-premise
mine I-premise
who I-premise
had I-premise
just I-premise
little I-premise
savings I-premise

and I-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
repair I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
car I-premise
. O

He B-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
the I-premise
maintenance I-premise
so O
he B-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
sell I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
with B-premise
savings I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
afford I-premise
some I-premise
luxurious I-premise
goods I-premise
and I-premise
fulfill I-premise
your I-premise
dreams I-premise
. O

Working B-claim
hard I-claim
and I-claim
saving I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
later I-claim
on I-claim
investments I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
getting I-claim
a I-claim
satisfying I-claim
feeling I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
reward I-claim
yourself I-claim
for I-claim
something I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
accomplished I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
made I-premise
a I-premise
month I-premise
- I-premise
long I-premise

with I-premise
my I-premise
girlfriend I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
our I-premise
savings I-premise
we I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
pursued I-premise
our I-premise
long I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
dream I-premise
. O

Considering O
all O
the O
above O
mentioned O
arguments O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O

there B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
other I-claim
choice I-claim
than I-claim
saving I-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
some I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Rush O
vs O
Slower O
Pace O
Modern O
technologies O
and O
globalization O
have O
increased O
the O
speed O
of O
life O
in O
the O
past O
decades O
tremendously O
. O

However O
, O
while O
the O
majority O
of O
people O
live O
on O
the O
fast O
lane O
, O
others O
decide O
to O
reduce O
the O
speed O
and O
take O
their O
time O
. O

To O
draw O
an O
entire O
picture O
, O
we O
have O
to O
consider O
both O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
this O
increased O
speed O
of O
life O
and O
ask O
our O
self O
which O
way O
of O
life O
is O
better O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
life I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
slower I-claim
pace I-claim
, O
because O
living B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
hurry I-claim
comes I-claim
along I-claim
with I-claim
several I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
. O

First O
, O
living B-claim
your I-claim
life I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
fast I-claim
lane I-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
stressful I-claim
and I-claim
can I-claim
affect I-claim
your I-claim
health I-claim
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
hurried I-premise
and I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
time I-premise
off I-premise
, I-premise
your I-premise
body I-premise
will I-premise
react I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
stressful I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
hardworking I-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
diseases I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
the I-premise
burn I-premise
- I-premise
out I-premise
syndrome I-premise
, O
because O
their B-premise
bodies I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
hold I-premise
the I-premise
pace I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my B-premise
father I-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
a I-premise
breakdown I-premise
several I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
his I-premise
stressful I-premise
job I-premise
. O

After B-premise
several I-premise
weeks I-premise
off I-premise
his I-premise
body I-premise
was I-premise
restored I-premise
, I-premise
now I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
reduced I-premise
the I-premise
tempo I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
and I-premise
is I-premise
doing I-premise
fine I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
living B-claim
your I-claim
life I-claim
at I-claim
a I-claim
slower I-claim
pace I-claim
increases I-claim
your I-claim
happiness I-claim
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
facing I-premise
excessive I-premise
stress I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
care I-premise
for I-premise
your I-premise
beloved I-premise
's I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
hurry I-premise
yourself I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
take I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
your I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Caring B-premise
for I-premise
your I-premise
social I-premise
environment I-premise
will I-premise
increase I-premise
your I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
reduce I-premise
your I-premise
stress I-premise
level I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
friend I-premise
of I-premise
mine I-premise
lives I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
slow I-premise
pace I-premise
and I-premise
is I-premise
really I-premise
satisfied I-premise
about I-premise
it I-premise
, O
because O
he B-premise
can I-premise
enjoy I-premise
his I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
cultivate I-premise
his I-premise
friendships I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
quality B-premise
takes I-premise
time I-premise
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
faced I-premise
with I-premise
difficult I-premise
tasks I-premise
and I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
rush I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
avoidable I-premise
errors I-premise
or I-premise
mistakes I-premise
. O

Doing B-premise
tasks I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
hurry I-premise
may I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
not I-premise
considering I-premise
all I-premise
necessary I-premise
aspects I-premise
or I-premise
opportunities I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
you B-claim
might I-claim
make I-claim
mistakes I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
would I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
done I-claim
with I-claim
more I-claim
patience I-claim
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
I B-premise
once I-premise
wrote I-premise
an I-premise
essay I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
hurry I-premise
and I-premise
got I-premise
a I-premise
bad I-premise
grade I-premise
, O
because O
I B-premise
made I-premise
few I-premise
mistakes I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
avoided I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
to O
say O
that O
, O
given O
the O
arguments O
above O
, O
living B-claim
a I-claim
slower I-claim
life I-claim
is I-claim
advantageous I-claim
for I-claim
your I-claim
health I-claim

your I-claim

even I-claim
the I-claim

In O
the O
past O

the O

steadily O
grew O
and O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
history O
, O
is O
exceeding O
seven O
billion O
. O

As O
a O
result O
more O

more O
natural O

be O
vanished O
to O
make O

But O

it O
important O
to O
preserve O
the O
land O
to O
maintain O
the O
other O
species O
living O
on O
our O
planet O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we B-claim
clearly I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
change I-claim
our I-claim
attitude I-claim
towards I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
because O
of O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the B-claim
natural I-claim
diversity I-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
further I-claim
generations I-claim
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
change I-premise
our I-premise
behavior I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
extinct I-premise
many I-premise
species I-premise
living I-premise
for I-premise
millions I-premise
of I-premise
years I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
planet I-premise
. O

As B-premise
we I-premise
destroy I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
habitat I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
forests I-premise
, I-premise
jungles I-premise
and I-premise
lakes I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
our I-premise
industry I-premise
and I-premise
farmland I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
rob I-premise
the I-premise
ecosystem I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
every B-premise
day I-premise
a I-premise
massive I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
Rainforest I-premise
in I-premise
South I-premise
America I-premise
is I-premise
destroyed I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
wood I-premise
and I-premise
farmland I-premise
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
preserve I-premise
this I-premise
important I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
ecosystem I-premise
many I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
will I-premise
loose I-premise
their I-premise
natural I-premise
habitat I-premise
and I-premise
go I-premise
extinct I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
further B-premise
generations I-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
these I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-claim
stable I-claim
and I-claim
sustainable I-claim
environment I-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
weather I-claim
. O

Our B-premise
behavior I-premise
causes I-premise
pollution I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
heavily I-premise
affects I-premise
the I-premise
weather I-premise
conditions I-premise
on I-premise
planet I-premise
Earth I-premise
and I-premise
causes I-premise
the I-premise
undoubtedly I-premise
Global I-premise
Warming I-premise
. O

This B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
affects I-premise
the I-premise
endangered I-premise
animals I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
the I-premise
humans I-premise
because O
we B-premise
are I-premise
affected I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
increasing I-premise
sea I-premise
level I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
climatic I-premise
changes I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
recent B-premise
studies I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
United I-premise
Nations I-premise
Organization I-premise
have I-premise
shown I-premise
that I-premise
, I-premise
till I-premise
2050 I-premise
the I-premise
sea I-premise
level I-premise
will I-premise
increase I-premise
over I-premise
one I-premise
meter I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
average I-premise
. O

This B-premise
will I-premise
dramaticly I-premise
affect I-premise
all I-premise
people I-premise
living I-premise
near I-premise
the I-premise
coast I-premise
and I-premise
change I-premise
the I-premise
global I-premise
climate I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
to O
say O
that O
, O
given O
the O
arguments O
above O
, O
we B-claim
definitely I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
change I-claim
our I-claim
behavior I-claim
towards I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
to I-claim
preserve I-claim
the I-claim
endangered I-claim
animals I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
to I-claim
preserve I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
living I-claim
conditions I-claim
. O

Going O
to O
classes O
should O
be O
optional O
for O
the O
students O
University O
students O
have O
different O
opinion O
about O
their O
attendance O
to O
class O
. O

Some O
students O
believe O
that O
they O
should O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
while O
others O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
an O
optional O
for O
the O
students O
. O

According O
to O
my O
opinion O
, O
because O
it B-claim
is I-claim
university I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
education I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
have I-claim
enough I-claim
maturity I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
their I-claim
choice I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
going B-claim
to I-claim
classes I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
optional I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
going B-claim
to I-claim
classes I-claim
are I-claim
sometimes I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some B-premise
lecturers I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
university I-premise
read I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
text I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
reference I-premise
books I-premise
for I-premise
that I-premise
particular I-premise
course I-premise
module I-premise
. O

Further O
, O
they B-premise
did I-premise
n't I-premise
explain I-premise
the I-premise
contents I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
. O

It B-premise
was I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Because O
the B-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
grown I-premise
up I-premise
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
enough I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
read I-claim
and I-claim
understand I-claim
the I-claim
text I-claim
book I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
with B-claim
the I-claim
modern I-claim
technology I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
collect I-claim
more I-claim
information I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
sources I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
from B-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
read I-premise
many I-premise
articles I-premise
and I-premise
e I-premise
- I-premise
books I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
watch I-premise
video I-premise
tutorials I-premise
which I-premise
provide I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
more I-premise
apparently I-premise
. O

However O
, O
some B-claim
lecturers I-claim
deliver I-claim
lectures I-claim
very I-claim
informative I-claim
and I-claim
interesting I-claim
way I-claim
. O

When B-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
attend I-premise
that I-premise
lectures I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
obviously I-premise
feel I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
very I-premise
useful I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
waste I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
mostly B-premise
university I-premise
has I-premise
taken I-premise
whole I-premise
day I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
lectures I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
most B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
working I-premise
students I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
the I-premise
expenses I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
education I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
part I-premise
time I-premise
basis I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
schedule I-claim
the I-claim
lectures I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
studying I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
working I-claim
time I-claim
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
rather B-claim
than I-claim
attending I-claim
any I-claim
boring I-claim
lecturers I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
participate I-claim
to I-claim
other I-claim
activities I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
debate I-claim
competition I-claim
, I-claim
swimming I-claim
meet I-claim
, I-claim
Basketball I-claim
and I-claim
so I-claim
forth I-claim
. O

From O
that O
they B-premise
can I-premise
meet I-premise
other I-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
build I-premise
up I-premise
the I-premise
relationships I-premise
with I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
although O
few B-claim
brilliant I-claim
lecturers I-claim
deliver I-claim
more I-claim
informative I-claim
lectures I-claim
, O
some B-premise
are I-premise
boring I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
and I-premise
wasting I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
time I-premise
. O

When B-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
go I-claim
to I-claim
university I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
matured I-claim
mentally I-claim
and I-claim
physically I-claim
. O

They B-claim
have I-claim
enough I-claim
knowledge I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
to O
make O
use O
of O
time O
, O
if B-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
choose I-claim
the I-claim
classes I-claim
as I-claim
optional I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
would I-claim
provide I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim
than I-claim
drawbacks I-claim
. O

Famous O
people O
are O
bothered O
by O
the O
media O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
mass O
media O
should O
only O
focus O
on O
news O
and O
current O
affairs O
. O

Others O
believe O
that O
television O
, O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
should O
keep O
us O
entertained O
and O
therefore O
they O
should O
pay O
attention O
to O
famous O
people O
lives O
as O
well O
. O

This O
issue O
is O
a O
controversial O
one O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
a O
closer O
examination O
reveals O
that O
mass B-claim
media I-claim
deal I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
with I-claim
superficial I-claim
things I-claim
for O
different O
reasons O
. O

One O
reason O
is O
that O
television B-claim
and I-claim
newspapers I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
famous I-claim
peoples I-claim
' I-claim
lives I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
their I-claim
audience I-claim
or I-claim
readership I-claim
. O

Gutter B-premise
press I-premise
and I-premise
Tabloid I-premise
TV I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
replacing I-premise
quality I-premise
papers I-premise
or I-premise
documentaries I-premise
programs I-premise
. O

Thanks B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
go I-premise
online I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
information I-premise
from I-premise
all I-premise
over I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
and O
therefore O
mass B-premise
media I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
need I-premise
any I-premise
more I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
informed I-premise
people I-premise
but I-premise
their I-premise
goal I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
enough I-premise
readers I-premise
or I-premise
TV I-premise
audience I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
we B-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
where I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
thing I-claim
is I-claim
appearance I-claim
and I-claim
gossip I-claim
. O

Nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
unscrupulous I-premise
paparazzi I-premise
constantly I-premise
follow I-premise
celebrities I-premise
just I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
photo I-premise
while I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
eating I-premise
or I-premise
training I-premise
. O

Newspapers B-premise
often I-premise
receive I-premise
accusations I-premise
of I-premise
checkbook I-premise
journalism I-premise
; I-premise
this I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
magazines I-premise
pay I-premise
people I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
stories I-premise
or I-premise
photos I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
Reality I-premise
TV I-premise
, I-premise
television I-premise
programs I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
put I-premise
into I-premise
artificial I-premise
environments I-premise
and I-premise
situations I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
like I-premise
" I-premise
Big I-premise
Brother I-premise
" I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
television B-claim
, I-claim
magazines I-claim
and I-claim
newspapers I-claim
pay I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
attention I-claim
of I-claim
peoples I-claim

I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
my I-claim
entire I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
one I-claim
place I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
my I-claim

In B-claim
my I-claim
hometown I-claim

I I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim

I I-claim
love I-claim
the I-claim

the I-claim

wonderful I-claim

I O

In B-premise
here I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
usually I-premise
spend I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
sports I-premise
like I-premise
soccer I-premise
, I-premise
basketball I-premise
and I-premise
of I-premise

we I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise

fun I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
town I-premise
have I-premise
known I-premise
each I-premise
others I-premise

and I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
good I-premise

If B-claim
anyone I-claim
needs I-claim
help I-claim

his I-claim
neighbor I-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
as I-claim
much I-claim

possible I-claim

Nowhere B-premise

can I-premise
give I-premise

some I-premise
people I-premise

I B-claim
want I-claim

live I-claim

because O
I B-premise
love I-premise
the I-premise
traffic I-premise
system I-premise
in I-premise
here I-premise
. O

We B-premise
have I-premise
large I-premise
streets I-premise

few I-premise
cars I-premise

so O
we B-premise

move I-premise

Last B-premise

I I-premise
went I-premise

the I-premise

meet I-premise
my I-premise

The B-premise
traffic I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
was I-premise
too I-premise
crowed I-premise

I B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
wait I-premise

an I-premise
hour I-premise

go I-premise

my I-premise

I B-claim
also I-claim
love I-claim
the I-claim

I B-premise
have I-premise

travel I-premise

stay I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
short I-premise
time I-premise

I I-premise
realize I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise

some I-premise
place I-premise

n't I-premise
clean I-premise

fresh I-premise

my I-premise
home I-premise
town I-premise

There B-premise
were I-premise
a I-premise

people I-premise
so O
the B-premise
environment I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
be I-premise
keep I-premise
clean I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
feel O
that O
staying B-claim
in I-claim
one I-claim
place I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
moving I-claim
number I-claim

Moving B-claim
some I-claim
places I-claim
can I-claim
give I-claim
to I-claim
you I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim

experiences I-claim
but O
living B-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
place I-premise
like I-premise
your I-premise
hometown I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
you I-premise
feel I-premise
comfortable I-premise

Dormitory O
or O
apartment O
? O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
choosing O
an O
accommodation O
after O
completion O
of O
their O
high O
school O
, O
most O
students O
always O
get O
confused O
between O
these O
two O
options O
: O
living O
in O
an O
apartment O
, O
or O
in O
university O
dormitories O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
both B-claim
choices I-claim
have I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
advantages I-claim
and I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
living B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dormitory I-premise
helps I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
familiarize I-premise
themselves I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
academic I-premise
environment I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students B-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
extracurricular I-premise
activities I-premise
happing I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
campus I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
attending I-premise
conversation I-premise
club I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
joining I-premise
sports I-premise
club I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
interaction I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
teachers I-premise
and I-premise
classmates I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
help I-premise
when I-premise
facing I-premise
problem I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
if I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
problem I-premise
in I-premise
solving I-premise
their I-premise
math I-premise
question I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
ask I-premise
for I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
roommates I-premise
, I-premise
classmates I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

I O
think O
living B-claim
in I-claim
dormitory I-claim
is I-claim
always I-claim
helpful I-claim
to I-claim
students I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
living B-claim
off I-claim
campus I-claim
prepares I-claim
students I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
many I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
responsible I-premise
, I-premise
independent I-premise
, I-premise
punctual I-premise
, I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
operative I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
university I-premise
dormitories I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
responsible I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
everything I-premise
including I-premise
paying I-premise
their I-premise
apartment I-premise
rent I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
dealing I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
utility I-premise
bills I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
students B-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
study I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
their I-premise
grades I-premise
higher I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students B-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
community I-premise
around I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Interacting B-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
socializing I-premise
with I-premise
them I-premise
prepares I-premise
students I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
life I-premise
after I-premise
graduation I-premise
. O

From O
given O
the O
evidences O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it O
becomes O
hard O
for O
students O
to O
choose O
between O
their O
living O
options O
since O
both B-claim
living I-claim
accommodation I-claim
have I-claim
its I-claim
own I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

If O
I O
have O
to O
choose O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
definitely I-claim
choose I-claim
the I-claim
second I-claim
option I-claim
: I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
apartment I-claim
. O

I O
think O
that O
it B-claim
teaches I-claim
me I-claim
everything I-claim
that I-claim
I I-claim
certainly I-claim
wants I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
because O
learning B-premise
all I-premise
those I-premise
characteristics I-premise
would I-premise
really I-premise
help I-premise
me I-premise
in I-premise
leading I-premise
successful I-premise
life I-premise
. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
classes O

Though O
out O
the O
last O
decade O
, O
the O
load O
of O
the O
university O
students O
has O
been O
constantly O
increasing O
. O

There O
are O
those O
who O
consider O
that O
university O
students O
can O
not O
attend O
any O
classes O
until O
the O
students O
pass O
the O
exam O
. O

There O
are O
those O
who O
said O
that O
student O
can O
attend O
the O
university O
coarse O
without O
passing O
the O
exam O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
students B-claim
can I-claim
acquire I-claim
university I-claim
knowledge I-claim
without I-claim
the I-claim
prerequisite I-claim
of I-claim
passing I-claim
exam I-claim
. O

The O
reasons O
to O
be O
illustrated O
are O
follows O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
constantly I-claim
expert I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
subject I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
love O
Physics O
. O

But O
I B-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
like I-premise
electronics I-premise
, O
because O
electronics B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
always I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
. O

And B-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
0 I-premise
in I-premise
physics I-premise
score I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
study I-premise
the I-premise
electronics I-premise
. O

But B-premise
I I-premise
constantly I-premise
achieve I-premise
100 I-premise
score I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
study I-premise
other I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
physics I-premise
. O

And B-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
attend I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
until I-premise
I I-premise
pass I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
of I-premise
electronics I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
pass I-premise
the I-premise
entire I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
physics I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
fail I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
over I-premise
and I-premise
over I-premise
again I-premise
. O

Luckily B-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
university I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
attend I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
regardless I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
score I-premise
you I-premise
reach I-premise
. O

And B-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
study I-premise
physics I-premise
without I-premise
consideration I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
electronics I-premise
. O

And B-premise
at I-premise
last I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
took I-premise
the I-premise
electronics I-premise
again I-premise
and I-premise
pass I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
if B-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
take I-claim
the I-claim
policy I-claim
that I-claim
no I-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
attend I-claim
the I-claim
classes I-claim
without I-claim
passing I-claim
exam I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
highly I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
leave I-claim
uncultivated I-claim
. O

If B-premise
one I-premise
fail I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

And B-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
nothing I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
campus I-premise
. O

Then O
he B-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
will I-premise
play I-premise
online I-premise
games I-premise
days I-premise
and I-premise
nights I-premise
. O

The B-premise
academic I-premise
achievement I-premise
will I-premise
decline I-premise
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
this B-premise
student I-premise
will I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
loser I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

And B-premise
all I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
permit I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
failure I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
the I-premise
entire I-premise
education I-premise
system I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-claim
university I-claim
student I-claim
may I-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
reach I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
if I-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
allow I-claim
student I-claim
to I-claim
participate I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
class I-claim
no I-claim
matter I-claim
whether I-claim
they I-claim
pass I-claim
the I-claim
test I-claim
or I-claim
not I-claim
. O

But O
the B-premise
benefit I-premise
of I-premise
free I-premise
to I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
classes I-premise
eclipse I-premise
the I-premise
issue I-premise
of I-premise
lower I-premise
points I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the B-claim
university I-claim
should I-claim
allow I-claim
the I-claim
student I-claim
to I-claim
participate I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
classed I-claim
without I-claim
passing I-claim
the I-claim
test I-claim
because O
not B-claim
only I-claim
is I-claim
every I-claim
students I-claim
expert I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
one I-claim
subject I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
student I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
campus I-claim
who I-claim
leave I-claim
uncultivated I-claim
. O

I O
'm O
against O
providing O
more O
money O
to O
professors O
University O
education O
is O
always O
an O
important O
part O
of O
one O
's O
life O
. O

That O
's O
why O
education O
in O
university O
is O
discussed O
all O
the O
time O
. O

What O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
orientate O
the O
students O
? O

Raising O
the O
salaries O
of O
professors O
so O
? O

I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

The B-claim
professors I-claim
are I-claim
essential I-claim
, O
however O
, O
the B-premise
schools I-premise
are I-premise
established I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Money B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
on I-claim
facilities I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
or I-claim
update I-claim
resources I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
school I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
just I-claim
instructors I-claim
. O

The O
following O
are O
my O
opinions O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
the B-claim
school I-claim
should I-claim
put I-claim
more I-claim
emphasis I-claim
on I-claim
students I-claim
instead I-claim
of I-claim
professors I-claim
. O

I O
think O
the B-premise
most I-premise
efficient I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
guide I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
actively I-premise
. O

By B-premise
renewing I-premise
some I-premise
facilities I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
so I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
spend I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
doing I-premise
assignment I-premise
. O

A B-premise
comfortable I-premise
environment I-premise
can I-premise
attract I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
stay I-premise
longer I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
students B-premise
spend I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
school I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
circulation I-premise
of I-premise
learning I-premise
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
students B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
environment I-premise
to I-premise
working I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
assignments I-premise
so O
the B-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
assignments I-premise
will I-premise
improve I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-premise
competition I-premise
between I-premise
peers I-premise
enhances I-premise
and I-premise
forms I-premise
a I-premise
circulation I-premise
. O

In B-premise
my I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
classrooms I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
university I-premise
are I-premise
old I-premise
and I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
shabby I-premise
. O

For O
me O
, O
I B-premise
prefer I-premise
spending I-premise
money I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
coffee I-premise
shop I-premise
to I-premise
staying I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
my I-premise
assignment I-premise
. O

It B-premise
's I-premise
unpleasant I-premise
to I-premise
stay I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
. O

However O
, O
coffee B-premise
shops I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
always I-premise
quiet I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
my I-premise
classmates I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
often I-premise
finish I-premise
our I-premise
work I-premise
roughly I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
the B-premise
ultimate I-premise
purpose I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise

This B-premise
event I-premise

The B-premise
proposal I-premise

eliminating I-premise

As O

the I-premise

At O

Students B-claim
' I-claim
tuition I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim

also I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
at I-claim

That O
's O
the O
main O
reason O
I B-claim
against I-claim

more I-claim

to I-claim
professors I-claim
. O

Students O

Our O
useful O
friends O
Pets O
have O
always O
been O
essential O
in O
our O
society O
. O

Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
the O
most O
common O
pets O
but O
there O
are O
birds O
, O
tortoises O
and O
fishes O
as O
well O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
pets O
should O
be O
treated O
like O
family O
members O
. O

However O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
they O
are O
just O
animals O
and O
are O
n't O
able O
to O
think O
like O
us O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
controversial O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
pets B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
treated I-claim
like I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
for O
different O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
pets B-claim
are I-claim
our I-claim
friends I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
certain I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
are I-claim
. O

Similarly B-premise
to I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
indeed I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
with I-premise
us I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
there I-premise
if I-premise
we I-premise
feel I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

We B-premise
can I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
because O
they B-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
us I-premise
, I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
some I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
ever I-premise
do I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
point O
, O
I O
can O
write O
about O
my O
own O
experience O
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
14 I-premise
years I-premise
old I-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
uncle I-premise
passed I-premise
away I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
felt I-premise
like I-premise
everything I-premise
was I-premise
no I-premise
longer I-premise
important I-premise
. O

Talking B-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
was I-premise
frustrating I-premise
because O
none B-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
have I-premise
ever I-premise
felt I-premise
that I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Since O
I B-premise
was I-premise
all I-premise
alone I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
, O
my B-premise
dog I-premise
was I-premise
near I-premise
me I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
seemed I-premise
to I-premise
me I-premise
that I-premise
only I-premise
him I-premise
could I-premise
understand I-premise
my I-premise
deeply I-premise
feelings I-premise
. O

Clearly O
, O
although O
pets B-premise
are I-premise
n't I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
speak I-premise
with I-premise
us I-premise
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
nonetheless I-premise
count I-premise
on I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
pets B-claim
are I-claim
useful I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
variety I-claim
of I-claim
things I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays B-premise
the I-premise
pet I-premise
therapy I-premise
is I-premise
becoming I-premise
more I-premise
popular I-premise
than I-premise
before I-premise
. O

Researchers B-premise
have I-premise
discovered I-premise
that I-premise
pets I-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
benefits I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
illnesses I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
dogs I-premise
who I-premise
lead I-premise
blind I-premise
people I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
and O
therefore O
without B-premise
them I-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
go I-premise
around I-premise
all I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
pets B-premise
are I-premise
important I-premise
for I-premise
depressed I-premise
people I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
because O
their B-premise
presence I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
feel I-premise
better I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
dogs I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
educated I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
out I-premise
criminals I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
their I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
smell I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
drugs I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
am O
strongly O
convinced O
that O
pets B-claim
deserve I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
treated I-claim
like I-claim
family I-claim
members I-claim
because O
of O
all O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O

namely O
they B-claim
are I-claim
our I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
useful I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
situations I-claim
. O

Extraordinarily O
cautious O
is O
important O
since O
rough O
work O
is O
intolerable O

This O
current O
world O
we O
situate O
ourselves O
in O
is O
rather O
unpredictable O
, O
even O
one O
sudden O
invention O
could O
bring O
down O
all O
the O
notions O
we O
used O
bear O
in O
mind O
. O

Most O
of O
us O
has O
endeavored O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
pace O
of O
the O
development O
of O
today O
's O
world O
in O
fast O
pace O
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
even O
when O
fast B-claim
pace I-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
the I-claim
wise I-claim
move I-claim
to I-claim
correspond I-claim
with I-claim
today I-claim
's I-claim
world I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it B-claim
might I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
beneficial I-claim
move I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Primarily O
, O
even B-claim
when I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
operates I-claim
in I-claim
fast I-claim
pace I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
still I-claim
requires I-claim
accuracy I-claim
. O

Even B-premise
simple I-premise
issues I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
daily I-premise
life I-premise
like I-premise
homework I-premise
require I-premise
accuracy I-premise
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
rush I-premise
through I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
by I-premise
taking I-premise
risk I-premise
of I-premise
making I-premise
mistakes I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
actually I-premise
making I-premise
zero I-premise
effort I-premise
going I-premise
through I-premise
our I-premise
study I-premise
roughly I-premise
only I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
fill I-premise
in I-premise
before I-premise
the I-premise
deadline I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
it B-premise
only I-premise
fulfills I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
itself I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
rather I-premise
worthless I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
our I-premise
capability I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
should I-premise
improve I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
holding I-premise
the I-premise
belief I-premise
in I-premise
completing I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Certainly O
it B-premise
may I-premise
take I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
others I-premise
if I-premise
w I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
review I-premise
our I-premise
work I-premise
multiple I-premise
times I-premise
, O
but O
with B-premise
consistent I-premise
work I-premise
soon I-premise
enough I-premise
we I-premise
'll I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
bring I-premise
up I-premise
our I-premise
speed I-premise
in I-premise
completion I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
other B-premise
than I-premise
the I-premise
importance I-premise
of I-premise
accuracy I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
also I-premise
seeks I-premise
efficiency I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
concludes I-premise
both I-premise
minimum I-premise
time I-premise
completion I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
criterion I-premise
of I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

Even B-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
managed I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
up I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
pace I-claim
by I-claim
neglecting I-claim
the I-claim
details I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
project I-claim
and I-claim
only I-claim
aim I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
general I-claim
frame I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
project I-claim
, I-claim
this I-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
something I-claim
satisfy I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
company I-claim
and I-claim
clients I-claim
. O

We B-premise
soon I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
picture I-premise
even I-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise
kept I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
pace I-premise
since O
when B-premise
the I-premise
problem I-premise
reveals I-premise
itself I-premise
we I-premise
'll I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
back I-premise
and I-premise
fix I-premise
the I-premise
mistakes I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
made I-premise
. O

This B-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
even I-premise
more I-premise
costly I-premise
and I-premise
time I-premise
consuming I-premise
than I-premise
a I-premise
neat I-premise
completion I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
start I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
when O
looking O
at O
this O
problem O
within O
a O
broader O
image O
. O

Some B-claim
work I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
tolerate I-claim
any I-claim
mistakes I-claim
at I-claim
all I-claim
, O
for O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
official I-premise
missions I-premise
like I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
NASA I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
tiny I-premise
mistake I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
catastrophic I-premise
. O

A B-premise
miscalculation I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
orbit I-premise
in I-premise
launching I-premise
rocket I-premise
may I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
failure I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
project I-premise
which I-premise
might I-premise
worth I-premise
trillions I-premise
of I-premise
dollars I-premise
. O

In O
such O
circumstances O
, O
even B-premise
when I-premise
the I-premise
scientists I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
off I-premise
quickly I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
could I-premise
n't I-premise
miss I-premise
even I-premise
a I-premise
single I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
mission I-premise
since I-premise
it I-premise
may I-premise
trigger I-premise
loads I-premise
of I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
even O
when O
we B-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
catch I-claim
up I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
pace I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
for I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
extraordinarily I-claim
cautious I-claim
since O
rough B-claim
work I-claim
is I-claim
intolerable I-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
stay I-claim
competitive I-claim
. O

Living O
in O
big O
cities O
or O
living O
in O
small O
towns O
Continuous O
technological O
and O
economical O
development O
in O
modern O
world O
created O
great O
differences O
between O
cities O
, O
a O
difference O
that O
is O
clearly O
visible O
in O
the O
size O
of O
various O
cities O
. O

From O
cities O
with O
more O
that O
20 O
million O
people O
to O
small O
towns O
inhabited O
by O
only O
hundreds O
of O
people O
. O

This O
diversities O
in O
cities O
allowed O
for O
more O
difference O
in O
people O
's O
preferences O
for O
where O
to O
live O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
bigger I-claim
cities I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
small I-claim
ones I-claim
, O
this O
personal O
attitude O
is O
the O
result O
of O
many O
factors O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
find O
the O
excitement O
of O
big O
cities O
to O
be O
attractive O
, O
living B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
dynamic I-claim
environment I-claim
can I-claim
turn I-claim
into I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
rich I-claim
experience I-claim
that I-claim
sharpens I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
personality I-claim
and I-claim
open I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
eyes I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
world I-claim
. O

Life B-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
cities I-premise
gives I-premise
one I-premise
new I-premise
challenges I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
let I-premise
it I-premise
be I-premise
deciding I-premise
which I-premise
restaurant I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
or I-premise
deciding I-premise
which I-premise
company I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
for I-premise
. O

For B-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
lifestyles I-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
attractive I-premise
and I-premise
is I-premise
considered I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
advantage I-premise
of I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
compared I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
constant I-premise
, I-premise
slow I-premise
paced I-premise
life I-premise
styles I-premise
of I-premise
small I-premise
towns I-premise
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
put O
big O
cities O
in O
front O
of O
small O
towns O
is O
the B-claim
facilitates I-claim
and I-claim
services I-claim
it I-claim
contains I-claim
which I-claim
support I-claim
and I-claim
improve I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
of I-claim
its I-claim
inhabitants I-claim
' I-claim
lives I-claim
, I-claim
hospitals I-claim
, I-claim
advanced I-claim
medical I-claim
facilities I-claim
can I-claim
satisfy I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
need I-claim
of I-claim
medical I-claim
safety I-claim
. O

Cultural B-claim
events I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
exhibitions I-claim
and I-claim
theatre I-claim
plays I-claim
can I-claim
enrich I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
and I-claim
widen I-claim
his I-claim
horizons I-claim
, I-claim
things I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
n't I-claim
offered I-claim
by I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
's O
undeniable O
that O
the O
economic B-premise
power I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
country I-premise
is I-premise
driven I-premise
by I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
wealth I-premise
and I-premise
finance I-premise
is I-premise
centered I-premise
and I-premise
controlled I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

With O
this O
kind O
of O
power O
big B-claim
cities I-claim
offer I-claim
more I-claim
opportunities I-claim
for I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
career I-claim
advancements I-claim
and I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
chances I-claim
of I-claim
higher I-claim
income I-claim
that I-claim
small I-claim
towns I-claim
does I-claim
, O
and O
higher B-premise
income I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
basis I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
happier I-premise
, I-premise
healthier I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
although O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
but O
assure O
that O
this O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
personal O
taste O
, O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
love I-claim
to I-claim
spend I-claim
some I-claim
days I-claim
in I-claim
countryside I-claim
to I-claim
recharge I-claim
my I-claim
soul I-claim
and I-claim
relieve I-claim
myself I-claim
from I-claim
daily I-claim
stress I-claim
. O

Every O
experience O
always O
gives O
us O
something O
to O
learn O
and O
keep O
for O
life O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
our O
life O
seems O
tough O
at O
the O
time O
but O
those O
difficult O
experiences O
of O
life O
become O
important O
lessons O
for O
the O
future O
. O

My O
opinion O
based O
on O
the O
reasons O
that O
Every O
tough O
experience B-claim
makes I-claim
us I-claim
more I-claim
skilled I-claim
, I-claim
improves I-claim
our I-claim
decision I-claim
making I-claim
and I-claim
makes I-claim
us I-claim
more I-claim
compatible I-claim
for I-claim
life I-claim
. O

The O
best O
example O
of O
it O
is O
how O
babies O
learn O
about O
basics O
survival O
habits O
during O
their O
childhood O
. O

Every B-premise
day I-premise
comes I-premise
with I-premise
new I-premise
challenges I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
like I-premise
walking I-premise
, O
eating O

etc O
. O
, O
but O
those B-claim
challenges I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
initial I-claim
life I-claim
teach I-claim
them I-claim
important I-claim
survival I-claim
lessons I-claim
which I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
for I-claim
whole I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
they I-premise
tried I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
walking I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
stumble I-premise
and I-premise
hurt I-premise
themselves I-premise
many I-premise
times I-premise
. O

But O
they B-premise
slowly I-premise
tune I-premise
their I-premise
technique I-premise
and I-premise
learned I-premise
to I-premise
walk I-premise
. O

All B-claim
inventions I-claim
and I-claim
experiments I-claim
are I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
many I-claim
unfortunate I-claim
observations I-claim
. O

No B-premise
known I-premise
scientist I-premise
has I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
first I-premise
attempt I-premise
. O

Scientists B-premise
try I-premise
and I-premise
test I-premise
many I-premise
specimens I-premise
before I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
Thomas B-premise
Edison I-premise
tested I-premise
around I-premise
10000 I-premise
bulbs I-premise
before I-premise
inventing I-premise
Light I-premise
bulb I-premise
. O

So O
, O
all B-premise
the I-premise
initial I-premise
experiments I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
difficult I-premise
and I-premise
frustrating I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
but I-premise
he I-premise
searched I-premise
for I-premise
more I-premise
options I-premise
and I-premise
learnt I-premise
new I-premise
findings I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
experiment I-premise
even I-premise
when I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
failing I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
attempts I-premise
and I-premise
finally I-premise
found I-premise
break I-premise
through I-premise
. O

Our B-claim
difficult I-claim
experiences I-claim
also I-claim
make I-claim
us I-claim
robust I-claim
and I-claim
strong I-claim
unknowingly I-claim
. O

We B-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
facing I-premise
a I-premise
toughest I-premise
time I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
when I-premise
we I-premise
think I-premise
back I-premise
about I-premise
those I-premise
moments I-premise
later I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
feel I-premise
more I-premise
confident I-premise
about I-premise
our I-premise
decisions I-premise
and I-premise
about I-premise
ourselves I-premise
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
moved I-premise
to I-premise
college I-premise
hostel I-premise
after I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
first I-premise
few I-premise
days I-premise
were I-premise
very I-premise
unsettling I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
because O
first B-premise
time I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
parent I-premise
and I-premise
staying I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
not I-premise
known I-premise
. O

I B-premise
had I-premise
felt I-premise
very I-premise
fragile I-premise
and I-premise
emotionally I-premise
distracted I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
then I-premise
slowly I-premise
I I-premise
started I-premise
adjusting I-premise
with I-premise
roommates I-premise
and I-premise
built I-premise
connection I-premise
with I-premise
them I-premise
. O

I B-premise
also I-premise
became I-premise
more I-premise
casual I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
experience I-premise
increased I-premise
my I-premise
communication I-premise
skill I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
speaking I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
to O
conclude O
my O
opinion O
on O
this O
statement O
, O
I O
want O
to O
mentioned O
that O
every B-claim
experience I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
whether I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
or I-claim
bad I-claim
always I-claim
gives I-claim
us I-claim
something I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
and I-claim
keep I-claim
for I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Good B-claim
experiences I-claim
give I-claim
us I-claim
good I-claim

bad I-claim
ones I-claim
teach I-claim
us I-claim

From O

traffic B-premise

nobody I-premise

so O
it B-premise

out I-premise

the I-premise

Charging B-claim

one I-claim
more I-claim

makes I-claim
no I-claim
sense I-claim

is I-claim
ridiculous I-claim

Majority B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise

buy I-premise

simply I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
safer I-premise

charging B-premise

adds I-premise

actually I-premise

Rather B-claim
than I-claim
passively I-claim
forcing I-claim
drivers I-claim

Sometimes B-premise

only I-premise

In O
these O
cases O

the B-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise

charged I-premise

a I-premise
fine I-premise

the I-premise
city I-premise

not I-premise

Simply O
put O
, O
charging B-claim
drivers I-claim
fees I-claim
regardless I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim

the I-claim
problems I-claim
could I-claim

even I-claim

In O
conclusion O
, O
" B-claim
rush I-claim
hours I-claim
" I-claim
are I-claim
usually I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
direct I-claim
consequence I-claim

Instead O
, O
the O
real O
causes O
of O

may O
fall O
on O
various O
of O
grounds O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
charging B-claim
drivers I-claim
for I-claim
another I-claim
fee I-claim
for I-claim
this I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
unreasonable I-claim
and I-claim
irrational I-claim
. O

The O
part O
- O
time O
job O
can O
let O
students O
experience O
the O
real O
adult O
life O
and O
know O
more O
about O
it O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
difference O
between O
school O
and O
society O
is O
bigger O
and O
bigger O
. O

If O
students O
want O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
society O
quickly O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
for I-claim
parents I-claim
to I-claim
encourage I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

There O
are O
some O
reasons O
can O
support O
my O
view O
. O

First O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
. O

Because O
most B-premise
people I-premise
they I-premise
contact I-premise
with I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
students I-premise
. O

However O
, O
when B-premise
students I-premise
do I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
whom I-premise
are I-premise
adults I-premise
. O

So O
, O
they B-claim
can I-claim
teach I-claim
students I-claim
many I-claim
things I-claim
about I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
. O

My B-premise
friend I-premise
Lisa I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
doing I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
now I-premise
, I-premise
tells I-premise
me I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
fabulous I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Through B-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
she I-premise
makes I-premise
friends I-premise
with I-premise
different I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
let I-premise
her I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
different I-premise
aspects I-premise
of I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Lisa B-premise
thought I-premise
in I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
work I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
core I-premise
; I-premise
but I-premise
after I-premise
she I-premise
knows I-premise
these I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
she I-premise
changes I-premise
her I-premise
mind I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
true I-premise
core I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
responsibility I-premise
but I-premise
not I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
thanks B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
her I-premise
new I-premise
friends I-premise
has I-premise
provided I-premise
; I-premise
now I-premise
she I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
confidence I-premise
about I-premise
her I-premise
future I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
parents B-premise
always I-premise
tell I-premise
students I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
much I-premise
tenser I-premise
than I-premise
school I-premise
life I-premise
. O

However O
, O
because O
we B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
experience I-premise
it I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
difficult I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
really I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
tense I-premise
the I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we B-claim
need I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
to I-claim
teach I-claim
us I-claim
how I-claim
hard I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
. O

Actually O
, O
some B-premise
questionnaires I-premise
indicate I-premise
that I-premise
if I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
taken I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
importantly I-premise
; I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
expect I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
than I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
not I-premise
taken I-premise
the I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
can I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
understand I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
better I-claim
. O

Third O
, O
some O
parents O
are O
afraid O
that O
the B-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
will I-claim
effect I-claim
student I-claim
' I-claim
study I-claim
. O

Actually O
, O
most B-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
job I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
holiday I-premise
, O
so O
it B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
study I-premise
. O

Compared B-premise
with I-premise
playing I-premise
computers I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
, I-premise
doing I-premise
part I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
jobs I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
choice I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
their I-premise
holiday I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
taking B-claim
the I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
can I-claim
let I-claim
students I-claim
experience I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
and I-claim
know I-claim
more I-claim
about I-claim
it I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
parents B-claim
should I-claim
encourage I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
the I-claim
part I-claim
- I-claim
time I-claim
job I-claim
. O

Being B-premise
by I-premise
nature I-premise
introvert I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
much I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
efforts I-premise
on I-premise
adjusting I-premise
to I-premise

especially I-premise
new I-premise

Once B-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
working I-premise
on I-premise
presentation I-premise
with I-premise
strangers I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
sat I-premise
aside I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
prepared I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
half I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
myself I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
making I-premise
attempts I-premise

Therefore O
, O
my B-claim
productivity I-claim
boosts I-claim
when I-claim
style I-claim
of I-claim
work I-claim
is I-claim
appropriate I-claim
with I-claim
my I-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
temper I-claim

Furthermore O
/ O
moreover O
, O
working B-claim
alone I-claim
allows I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
avoid I-claim
spending I-claim
time I-claim
and I-claim
efforts I-claim
on I-claim
many I-claim
things I-claim
that I-claim
are I-claim
an I-claim
integral I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
teamwork I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I B-premise

These B-premise
advantages I-premise
are I-premise

important I-premise
in I-premise
situations I-premise

In O
conclusion O

from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
type B-claim
of I-claim
temper I-claim
and I-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
individual I-claim
work I-claim

the I-claim

Work O
for O
themselves O
vs O
work O
for O
employer O

Most O
people O
want O
to O
work O
for O
an O
employer O
, O
because O
they O
want O
to O
feel O
secure O
about O
their O
salary O
, O
or O
feel O
comfortable O
about O
other O
problems O
of O
having O
own O
job O
such O
as O
paying O
tax O
, O
worrying O
about O
selling O
, O
etc O
. O

Despite O
these O
problems O
, O
personally O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
my I-claim
own I-claim
job I-claim
. O

My O
arguments O
are O
listed O
as O
follows O
. O

First O
, O
time B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
more I-claim
valuable I-claim
thing I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
I I-claim
have I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
. O

By B-premise
having I-premise
my I-premise
own I-premise
business I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
manage I-premise
my I-premise
own I-premise
time I-premise
. O

I O
could B-premise
work I-premise
whenever I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
I I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
reasons I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
boss I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
delay I-premise
. O

I B-premise
can I-premise
arrange I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
long I-premise
hours I-premise
for I-premise
earning I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Totally O
, O
the B-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
reason I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
employed I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
free I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
earning B-premise
money I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
fundamental I-premise
reason I-premise
that I-premise
why I-premise
people I-premise
work I-premise
. O

The B-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
criterion I-premise
for I-premise
everyone I-premise
to I-premise
choose I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

If B-premise
I I-premise
work I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
my I-premise
ideas I-premise
to I-premise
employers I-premise
cheaply I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I B-claim
never I-claim
have I-claim
been I-claim
rich I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
, O
because O
my B-premise
salary I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
dramatically I-premise
changed I-premise
. O

In O
spite O
of O
many O
problems O
of O
having O
own O
business O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
earn I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
my I-premise
creativity I-premise
and I-premise
personal I-premise
ideas I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
many B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
eager I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
for I-claim
themselves I-claim
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
run I-claim
my I-claim
own I-claim
business I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
my I-claim
own I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
earn I-claim
more I-claim
money I-claim
based I-claim
on I-claim
my I-claim
noble I-claim
ideas I-claim
. O

Parents O
are O
our O
teachers O
from O
the O
very O
early O
time O
in O
our O
life O

Learning O
is O
a O
thing O
that O
we O
do O
in O
all O
of O
our O
lives O
. O

Getting O
the O
best O
lessons O
, O
besides O
our O
abilities O
to O
self O
- O
study O
, O
depends O
on O
our O
teachers O
a O
lot O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
no B-claim
one I-claim
else I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
our I-claim
parents I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
teachers I-claim
. O

I O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
because O
of O
these O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
our I-claim
teachers I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
very I-claim
early I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
life I-claim
. O

As B-premise
we I-premise
were I-premise
born I-premise
, I-premise
parents I-premise
taught I-premise
us I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
very I-premise
little I-premise
things I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
smile I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
walk I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
ordinary I-premise
routines I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
eating I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
when B-premise
we I-premise
grow I-premise
bigger I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
teach I-premise
us I-premise
many I-premise
fairy I-premise
tales I-premise
and I-premise
several I-premise
important I-premise
ethic I-premise
lessons I-premise
that I-premise
affect I-premise
us I-premise
till I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
at B-premise
school I-premise
we I-premise
study I-premise
bigger I-premise
things I-premise
about I-premise
sciences I-premise
and I-premise
languages I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
after I-premise
school I-premise
we I-premise
learn I-premise
from I-premise
our I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we B-premise
spend I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
time I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
with I-premise
our I-premise
families I-premise
than I-premise
it I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
. O

I O
think O
when B-premise
we I-premise
leave I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
maybe I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
forget I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
lessons I-premise
we I-premise
learn I-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
if I-premise
we I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
experience I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
, O
but O
I O
strongly O
believe O
we B-claim
will I-claim
never I-claim
forget I-claim
what I-claim
our I-claim
parents I-claim
have I-claim
taught I-claim
us I-claim
because O
we B-premise
use I-premise
it I-premise
every I-premise
day I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
believe I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
forget I-premise
what I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
told I-premise
me I-premise
about I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
grateful I-premise
to I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
help I-premise
me I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
I O
totally O
believe O
parents B-premise
love I-premise
their I-premise
sons I-premise
or I-premise
daughters I-premise
unconditionally I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
even B-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
grow I-claim
older I-claim
, I-claim
get I-claim
married I-claim
and I-claim
then I-claim
have I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
families I-claim
with I-claim
spouses I-claim
and I-claim
children I-claim
, I-claim
parents I-claim
always I-claim
keep I-claim
watching I-claim
us I-claim
and I-claim
help I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
realize I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
right I-claim
and I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
wrong I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my B-premise
older I-premise
brother I-premise
has I-premise
got I-premise
married I-premise
and I-premise
lived I-premise
independently I-premise
for I-premise
two I-premise
years I-premise
but I-premise
when I-premise
he I-premise
faces I-premise
difficulties I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
work I-premise
or I-premise
his I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
comes I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
our I-premise
parents I-premise
and I-premise
ask I-premise
for I-premise
advice I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
parents B-claim
are I-claim
our I-claim
best I-claim
teachers I-claim
. O

Different O
types O
of O
tasks O
endow O
more O
colors O
to O
our O
life O

In O
my O
family O
, O
the O
argument O
topic O
between O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
always O
involves O
my O
father O
's O
job O
. O

Five O
years O
ago O
, O
he O
quitted O
his O
20 O
years O
job O
as O
an O
architectural O
engineer O
, O
and O
became O
a O
landscape O
painter O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
asked O
him O
why O
, O
he O
will O
say O
, O
seriously O
, O
" O
I O
am O
done O
, O
doing O
this O
same O
work O
for O
20 O
years O
and O
I O
really O
want O
to O
try O
some O
different O
, O
that O
is O
all O
. O

" O

While O
there O
are O
innumerous O
people O
will O
deem O
it O
ridiculous O
and O
argue O
doing O
the O
same O
task O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
job O
, O
but O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
am O
on O
the O
side O
of O
my O
father O
. O

Most O
of O
workers O
have O
adapted O
to O
do O
same O
task O
. O

It B-premise
allows I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
more I-premise
. O

As B-premise
a I-premise
authoritative I-premise
dentist I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
province I-premise
, I-premise
my I-premise
mother I-premise
has I-premise
worked I-premise
for I-premise
25 I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Gandhi B-premise
devoted I-premise
his I-premise
whole I-premise
life I-premise
to I-premise
fight I-premise
against I-premise
British I-premise
- I-premise
ruled I-premise
government I-premise
and I-premise
inspire I-premise
movements I-premise
for I-premise
civil I-premise
rights I-premise
in I-premise
India I-premise
, I-premise
finally I-premise
he I-premise
became I-premise
the I-premise
father I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
nation I-premise
. O

These O
examples O
make O
it O
obvious O
that O
great B-claim
achievement I-claim
needs I-claim
someone I-claim
keen I-claim
on I-claim
one I-claim
task I-claim
for I-claim
long I-claim
time I-claim
. O

While O
when B-premise
it I-premise
comes I-premise
to I-premise
" I-premise
happier I-premise
" I-premise
, I-premise
different I-premise
type I-premise
of I-premise
jobs I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
responsible I-premise
factor I-premise
. O

Doing B-premise
different I-premise
tasks I-premise
makes I-premise
employees I-premise
and I-premise
employers I-premise
much I-premise
happier I-premise
. O

Workers B-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
work I-premise
for I-premise
an I-premise
ordinary I-premise
company I-premise
or I-premise
industry I-premise
, I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
sick I-premise
of I-premise
same I-premise
tasks I-premise
day I-premise
by I-premise
day I-premise
. O

Although O
they B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
, O
changing B-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
is I-premise
what I-premise
serve I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
happier I-premise
. O

Changing B-claim
the I-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
work I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
fresh I-claim
and I-claim
elicit I-claim
their I-claim
potential I-claim
to I-claim
adapt I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
environment I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
, I-claim
according I-claim
to I-claim
psychology I-claim
theories I-claim
, I-claim
makes I-claim
workers I-claim
relaxed I-claim
and I-claim
happier I-claim
. O

To O
set O
another O
example O
, O
consider B-premise
every I-premise
workers I-premise
have I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
several I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
employers I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
satisfied I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
generating I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

They B-premise
both I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
happy I-premise
because O
the B-premise
change I-premise
of I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
task I-premise
day I-premise
by I-premise
day I-premise
. O

Different B-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
tasks I-premise
during I-premise
workday I-premise
brings I-premise
more I-premise
challenges I-premise
, I-premise
making I-premise
life I-premise
colorful I-premise
. O

Just B-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
song I-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
challenge I-premise
, I-premise
life I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
blue I-premise
. O

As B-premise
an I-premise
engineering I-premise
researcher I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
surely I-premise
be I-premise
disappointed I-premise
for I-premise
failure I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
exited I-premise
for I-premise
new I-premise
challenges I-premise
. O

New B-premise
challenges I-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
tasks I-premise
amounts I-premise
far I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
more I-premise
works I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
also I-premise
means I-premise
through I-premise
dealing I-premise
with I-premise
it I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
obtain I-premise
more I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
experience I-premise
. O

As B-premise
the I-premise
saying I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
Chinese I-premise
writer I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
color I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise

not I-premise
in I-premise
Japanese I-premise
cherry I-premise

Canadian I-premise
maple I-premise

but I-premise
rather I-premise
there I-premise
always I-premise
exists I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
and I-premise
challenge I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
doing B-claim
same I-claim
task I-claim
day I-claim

night I-claim
just I-claim
server I-claim

To O
sum O
up O

I O

while O
the B-claim

an I-claim
expert I-claim
, O
like O
my O

I O
still O
hold O
the O

different B-claim
types I-claim

more I-claim
colors I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim

Excellent O
knowledge O
is O
better O
than O
ability O
to O
adopt O
oneself O
With O
the O

development O
of O
economy O
, O
the O
controversial O
of O
good O
worker O

is O
always O
in O
a O
limelight O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
people O
will O
say O
the O
ability O
to O
adapt O
oneself O
to O
a O
new O
environment O
is O
necessary O
, O
because O
it O
is O
the O
basic O
communication O
skill O
for O
a O
new O
worker O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
there B-claim
is I-claim
only I-claim
one I-claim
thing I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
company I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
only I-claim
one I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
an I-claim
outstanding I-claim
worker I-claim
, I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
possessing I-claim
excellent I-claim
knowledge I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
job I-claim
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
excellent I-claim
knowledge I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
job I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
significant I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
adapt I-claim
oneself I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
environment I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
proven I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
job I-claim
. O

This B-premise
ability I-premise
is I-premise
helpful I-premise
in I-premise
communicating I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
workmates I-premise
, I-premise
cooperating I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
workers I-premise
needs I-premise
this I-premise
ability I-premise
, I-premise
too I-premise
. O

But O
working B-premise
alone I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
longer I-premise
- I-premise
term I-premise
job I-premise
than I-premise
communicating I-premise
, O
that O
is O
, O
the B-premise
ability I-premise
of I-premise
adapting I-premise
oneself I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
environment I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
fresh I-premise
worker I-premise
, O
but O
the B-premise
excellent I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
job I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
benefit I-premise
till I-premise
one I-premise
leave I-premise
. O

The B-claim
company I-claim
will I-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
every I-claim
worker I-claim
of I-claim
excellent I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

The B-premise
core I-premise
and I-premise
most I-premise
profitable I-premise
technology I-premise
of I-premise
an I-premise
IT I-premise
company I-premise
is I-premise
invented I-premise
by I-premise
a I-premise
worker I-premise
with I-premise
excellent I-premise
computer I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
a I-premise
worker I-premise
with I-premise
outstanding I-premise
communicating I-premise
skill I-premise
. O

The B-premise
high I-premise
reputation I-premise
and I-premise
popularity I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
company I-premise
is I-premise
earned I-premise
by I-premise

So O
the B-premise

reward I-claim
from I-claim
hard I-claim
- I-claim
work I-claim
pursuing I-claim
excellent I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

Through B-premise
our I-premise
whole I-premise
study I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
undergraduate I-premise
and I-premise
graduate I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
keep I-premise
learning I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
exerting I-premise
these I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
experience I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
just I-premise
like I-premise
an I-premise
old I-premise
Chinese I-premise
scholar I-premise
said I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
essence I-premise
of I-premise
study I-premise
is I-premise
utilizing I-premise
it I-premise
. O

After B-premise
we I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
destination I-premise
of I-premise
we I-premise
keep I-premise
accumulating I-premise
and I-premise
collecting I-premise
knowledge I-premise
is I-premise
rooted I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
fawn I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
manager I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
adapt I-premise
this I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
business I-premise
culture I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
in I-premise
making I-premise
us I-premise
excellent I-premise
and I-premise
totally I-premise
master I-premise
this I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
we B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
rewarded I-premise
with I-premise
pride I-premise
. O

That O
's O
why O
we B-premise
can I-premise
obtain I-premise
reward I-premise
from I-premise
out I-premise
excellent I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
although O
we B-claim
can I-claim
use I-claim
the I-claim
ability I-claim
of I-claim
adapting I-claim
oneself I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
environment I-claim
, O
the B-claim
excellent I-claim
knowledge I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
of I-claim
more I-claim
importance I-claim
. O

Because O
it B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
benefit I-claim
our I-claim
employers I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
ourselves I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
rewarded I-claim
. O

People O
benefit O
more O
from O
coming O
computers O
into O
their O
lives O
Computers O
have O
revolutionized O
our O
lifestyle O
during O
last O
century O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
especially O
young O
ones O
use O
computers O
extremely O
and O
this O
excessive O
usage O
lead O
to O
increase O
stress O
among O
them O
, O
but O
computers O
have O
brought O
many O
advantages O
to O
our O
lives O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
computers B-claim
have I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
and I-claim
inevitable I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
economic I-claim
, I-claim
business I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
other I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
societies I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they B-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
easier I-claim
by I-claim
doing I-claim
our I-claim
routine I-claim
duties I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
by B-premise
using I-premise
computers I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
industries I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
role I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
reduced I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
computer I-premise
can I-premise
control I-premise
and I-premise
perform I-premise
some I-premise
routine I-premise
activities I-premise
in I-premise
industries I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
were I-premise
early I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
human I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
industries I-premise
use I-premise
computers I-premise
to I-premise
command I-premise
to I-premise
robots I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
many I-premise
regular I-premise
tasks I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
were I-premise
carried I-premise
out I-premise
by I-premise
human I-premise
early I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
many B-premise
processes I-premise
of I-premise
production I-premise
of I-premise
cars I-premise
are I-premise
carrying I-premise
out I-premise
by I-premise
robots I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
controlled I-premise
by I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
car B-premise
companies I-premise
use I-premise
computers I-premise
to I-premise
simulate I-premise
and I-premise
analyze I-premise
car I-premise
accident I-premise
by I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

Despite B-premise
many I-premise
advantages I-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
coming I-premise
computers I-premise
many I-premise
jobs I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
vanished I-premise
. O

A B-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
industries I-claim
fire I-claim
many I-claim
forces I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
doing I-claim
their I-claim
works I-claim
by I-claim
new I-claim
technologies I-claim
and I-claim
computers I-claim
. O

Computers B-claim
have I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
social I-claim
and I-claim
personal I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Computers B-premise
have I-premise
opened I-premise
up I-premise
a I-premise
network I-premise
connection I-premise
among I-premise
people I-premise
. O

This B-premise
technology I-premise
makes I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
send I-premise
and I-premise
receive I-premise
personal I-premise
message I-premise
. O

Teenagers B-premise
and I-premise
adolescents I-premise
spend I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
People B-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
computers I-premise
to I-premise
extract I-premise
their I-premise
essential I-premise
information I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
excessive B-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
computers I-claim
has I-claim
brought I-claim
many I-claim
difficulties I-claim
. O

The B-premise
results I-premise
show I-premise
that I-premise
teenagers I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
addicted I-premise
to I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
show I-premise
more I-premise
violent I-premise
and I-premise
stressful I-premise
behaviors I-premise
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
type I-premise
by I-premise
computers I-premise
may I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
such I-premise
disease I-premise
related I-premise

. O

By O
considering O
all O
reasons O

advantages B-claim
of I-claim
computers I-claim
outweigh I-claim
disadvantages I-claim

People B-claim
benefit I-claim
more I-claim
from I-claim
coming I-claim
computers I-claim
into I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
computers B-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
most I-premise
difficult I-premise
tasks I-premise
which I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
life I-premise
easier I-premise
. O

Is O
it O
necessary O
for O

Learning O
a O

necessary O
for O

Whether O

start O
learning O
a O
foreign O

as O
they O
start O
school O

not O
might O
be O
a O
controversial O
issue O
. O

It B-claim
seems I-claim
to I-claim
me I-claim
that I-claim
students I-claim
should I-claim
start I-claim
learning I-claim
that I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
start I-claim
school I-claim
. O

Learning B-claim
that I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
their I-claim
minds I-claim
and I-claim
memories I-claim

but I-claim
can I-claim
extend I-claim
their I-claim
visions I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

First O
, O
the B-premise
ability I-premise
of I-premise
Learning I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
childhood I-premise
period I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
powerful I-premise
than I-premise
other I-premise
periods I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Thereby O
students B-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
beginning I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
education I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
faster I-premise
and I-premise
easier I-premise
in I-premise
compare I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
young I-premise
one I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise

They B-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
understand I-premise
the I-premise
language I-premise
structure I-premise
and I-premise
memorize I-premise
the I-premise
vocabularies I-premise
. O

It O
is O
out O
of O
of O
the O
questioned O
that O
the B-premise
persistence I-premise
of I-premise
learning I-premise
a I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
childhood I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
other I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

By O
considering O
this O
and O
being O
aware O

that O
students O
have O
not O
any O
responsibility O
and O
other O
difficulty O
in O
comparison O
with O
a O
young O
man O
, O
we O
can O
infer O
that O
why O
this B-claim
time I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
any I-claim
language I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Learning B-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
helps I-premise
students I-premise
tremendously I-premise
to I-premise
comprehend I-premise
what I-premise
happens I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
around I-premise
World I-premise
. O

They B-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
other I-premise
cultures I-premise

costumes I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
It B-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
them I-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
power I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
better I-premise
with I-premise
peers I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
World I-premise
. O

Having B-premise
knowledge I-premise
about I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
languages I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
extend I-premise
the I-premise
child I-premise
's I-premise
vision I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
develop I-claim
their I-claim
personalities I-claim

sense I-claim
of I-claim
reliance I-claim

Overall O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
easy I-claim
to I-claim
distinguish I-claim
between I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
having I-claim
two I-claim
languages I-claim
and I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
having I-claim
just I-claim
his I-claim
native I-claim
language I-claim
while I-claim
comparing I-claim
their I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
communicate I-claim
, I-claim
understanding I-claim
other I-claim
studies I-claim
, I-claim
etc I-claim
, O
to O
find O
that O
why O
children B-claim
should I-claim
start I-claim
learning I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim

it O
is O
more O
frustrating O
if O
you O
had O

then O
it O
went O
wrong O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
essential I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
chances I-claim
and I-claim
believe I-claim
this I-claim
is I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
out I-claim

Assuming B-claim
new I-claim
opportunities I-claim
is I-claim
indispensable I-claim

In O
fact O

life B-premise
may I-premise

it I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
various I-premise
challenges I-premise

when I-premise
you I-premise
take I-premise
risks I-premise

but O
in B-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
surprisingly I-premise
wonderful I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
abandon I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
other I-premise
country I-premise
without I-premise
knowing I-premise
what I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
holds I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise

In B-premise
the I-premise
beginning I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
tough I-premise
to I-premise
fit I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
new I-premise
place I-premise
and I-premise
find I-premise
any I-premise
opportunity I-premise
, O
but O
after B-premise
fighting I-premise
against I-premise
the I-premise
obstacles I-premise
blocking I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
desired I-premise
; I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
possible I-premise
to I-premise
conquer I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
craving I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
start I-premise
to I-premise
build I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
life I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
other I-premise
country I-premise

In O
fact O
, O
many B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
afraid I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
risks I-premise

fail I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
possible I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise

along I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise

it B-claim
is I-claim
vital I-claim
to I-claim
never I-claim
give I-claim
up I-claim
on I-claim
your I-claim
dream I-claim

To O
illustrate O
, O
Walt B-premise
Disney I-premise
, I-premise
whose I-premise
career I-premise

famous I-premise

had I-premise
a I-premise
challenging I-premise
life I-premise

One B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
difficulties I-premise

some I-premise

his I-premise

such I-premise
as I-premise
Mickey I-premise

were I-premise
turned I-premise
down I-premise
. O

He B-premise
heard I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
" I-premise
no I-premise
" I-premise
, I-premise
furthermore I-premise
one I-premise
editor I-premise
fired I-premise
him I-premise
alleging I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
no I-premise
imagination I-premise

after I-premise
all I-premise
what I-premise
he I-premise
had I-premise
gone I-premise
through I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
never I-premise
stop I-premise
chasing I-premise
his I-premise
dreams I-premise

To O
conclude O
, O
in B-claim
this I-claim
competitive I-claim
world I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
fearless I-claim
and I-claim
face I-claim
all I-claim
new I-claim
situations I-claim
. O

Even O
though O
sometimes B-claim
you I-claim
consider I-claim
backing I-claim
down I-claim
and I-claim
stay I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
routine I-claim
that I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
used I-claim
to I-claim
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
courage I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
risks I-claim
, I-claim
be I-claim
different I-claim
and I-claim
pursue I-claim
your I-claim
dream I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
successful I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
personal O
live O

we O
have O
some O
responsibilities O

other O
people O
People O
should O
sometimes O
do O
things O

even O
though O
they O
do O

This O
is O
basic O
part O
of O
the O
lives O
. O

There O
may O
be O
small O
or O
big O
things O

but O
at O
last O
people O
should O
accept O
them O
, O
because O
most O
of O
them O
is O
about O
responsibilities O

Moreover O

sometimes O
by O
doing O
things O

the O
people O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
the O
reasons O
for O
why O
I O
agree O
that O
people B-claim
should I-claim
sometimes I-claim
do I-claim
things I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
enjoy I-claim
doing O
will O
be O
explored O
. O

Firstly O
, O
most B-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
lives I-premise
are I-premise
filled I-premise
with I-premise
tasks I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
enjoy I-premise
doing I-premise
. O

In B-claim
personal I-claim
live I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
towards I-claim
to I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
nobody I-claim
who I-claim
likes I-claim
all I-claim
of I-claim
these I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
housework B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
difficult I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
although I-premise
my I-premise
husband I-premise
helps I-premise
me I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
my I-premise
responsibility I-premise
. O

I B-premise
really I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
like I-premise
any I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
however I-premise
I I-premise
should I-premise
do I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
professional B-claim
lives I-claim
are I-claim
filled I-claim
with I-claim
tasks I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
neccessary I-claim
parts I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
jobs I-claim
. O

Nobody B-premise
likes I-premise
attending I-premise
boring I-premise
conferences I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
working I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise

well I-premise
in I-premise

anyone I-premise

I B-premise
'm I-premise
a I-premise

a I-premise
university I-premise

and I-premise
as I-premise
any I-premise

the I-premise

about I-premise
his I-premise
field I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
doing B-claim
something I-claim
which I-claim
an I-claim
individual I-claim
does I-claim
n't I-claim
enjoy I-claim
can I-claim
led I-claim
to I-claim
enjoyment I-claim
. O

People B-premise
sometimes I-premise
can I-premise
attend I-premise
any I-premise
activities I-premise
by I-premise
insisting I-premise
on I-premise
any I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
although I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
really I-premise
want I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
one B-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
friends I-premise
tell I-premise
my I-premise
husband I-premise
and I-premise
me I-premise
about I-premise
a I-premise
dance I-premise
course I-premise
which I-premise
we I-premise
both I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
like I-premise
. O

After B-premise
insisting I-premise
on I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
attended I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
got I-premise
really I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
continued I-premise
the I-premise
course I-premise
about I-premise
six I-premise
months I-premise
although I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
friends I-premise
left I-premise
the I-premise
course I-premise
after I-premise
a I-premise
month I-premise
. O

Nobody O
has O
a O
life O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
; O
there B-claim
are I-claim
sometimes I-claim
unpleasant I-claim
and I-claim
boring I-claim
parts I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
liked I-claim
by I-claim
anyone I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
most I-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
are I-claim
about I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
individual I-claim
's I-claim
live I-claim
. O

Young O
adults O
preference O
on O
how O
long O
they O
should O
live O
with O
their O
parents O
before O
moving O
out O
As O
young O
people O
gets O
older O
they O
tend O
to O
seek O
more O
freedom O
and O
want O
to O
live O
on O
their O
own O
. O

But O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
what O
is O
the O
right O
age O
for O
young O
adults O
to O
leave O
their O
parents O
and O
start O
living O
on O
their O
own O
is O
a O
contentious O
one O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
young B-claim
adults I-claim
should I-claim
live I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
longer I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Living B-premise
on I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
huge I-premise
financial I-premise
commitment I-premise
. O

At B-premise
younger I-premise
age I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
high I-premise
paying I-premise
job I-premise
, O
so O
It B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
difficult I-premise
task I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
rent I-premise
, I-premise
food I-premise
, I-premise
utilities I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
expenses I-premise
to I-premise
sustain I-premise
yourself I-premise
. O

So O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living B-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
wise I-claim
choice I-claim
for I-claim
adults I-claim
until I-claim
they I-claim
get I-claim
a I-claim
head I-claim
start I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
professional I-claim
career I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
reasonable I-claim
income I-claim
. O

Another B-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
longer I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
enhanced I-claim
emotional I-claim
attachment I-claim
with I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Parents B-premise
have I-premise
valuable I-premise
advice I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
go I-premise
through I-premise
the I-premise
changes I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
adult I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Living B-premise
together I-premise
develops I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
of I-premise
discussing I-premise
adult I-premise
's I-premise
physiological I-premise
and I-premise
psychological I-premise
changes I-premise
face I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Young B-premise
adults I-premise
will I-premise
feel I-premise
reluctant I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
such I-premise
problems I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
move I-premise
out I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
thus I-premise
missing I-premise
the I-premise
valuable I-premise
input I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

While O
some O
critics O
may O
argue O
that O
, O
young B-claim
adults I-claim
living I-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
free I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
most B-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
are I-premise
inclined I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
unprecedented I-premise
advantages I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
freedom I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
good I-premise
thing I-premise
if I-premise
living I-premise
with I-premise
parents I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
give I-premise
freedom I-premise
for I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
party I-premise
all I-premise
night I-premise
, I-premise
smoke I-premise
or I-premise
do I-premise
drugs I-premise
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
young B-claim
adults I-claim
should I-claim
only I-claim
consider I-claim
living I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
only I-claim
after I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
sure I-claim
they I-claim
could I-claim
sustain I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
unwise I-premise
to I-premise
trade I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
of I-premise
living I-premise
with I-premise
parents I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
longer I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
some I-premise
late I-premise
night I-premise
parties I-premise
or I-premise
drugs I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
to B-claim
cope I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
physiological I-claim
and I-claim
psychological I-claim
changes I-claim
of I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
financial I-claim
life I-claim
a I-claim
less I-claim
struggle I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
prevent I-claim
oneself I-claim
digress I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
destined I-claim
path I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
young I-claim
adults I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
longer I-claim
period I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim

Technology O
impact O
on O
people O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
Earth O
has O
become O
like O
a O
small O
village O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
last O
hundred O
years O
, O
the O
way O
majority O
of O
people O
communicate O
with O
each O
other O
has O
been O
altered O
significantly O
because O
of O
technology O
. O

But O
there O
are O
vast O
amount O
of O
disputes O
whether O
it O
is O
positive O
or O
negative O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
this B-claim
development I-claim
was I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
positive I-claim
one I-claim
in O
spite O
of O
its O
some O
drawbacks O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
nowadays B-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
in I-premise
touch I-premise
with I-premise
loved I-premise
ones I-premise
in I-premise
faraway I-premise
places I-premise
has I-premise
become I-premise
easy I-premise
than I-premise
ever I-premise
. O

Technology B-claim
revolutionized I-claim
the I-claim
way I-claim
we I-claim
communicate I-claim
and O
in O
present O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
almost I-premise
possible I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
everything I-premise
without I-premise
tete I-premise
- I-premise
a I-premise
- I-premise
tete I-premise
. O

By B-premise
means I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
software I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Skype I-premise
, I-premise
MSN I-premise
, I-premise

Whatsapp I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
in I-premise
touch I-premise
with I-premise
everybody I-premise
whenever I-premise
we I-premise
want I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
earlier I-premise
times I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
did I-premise
n't I-premise
leave I-premise
for I-premise
faraway I-premise
places I-premise
, O
because O
they B-premise
could I-premise
easily I-premise
get I-premise
lost I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
one I-premise
salient I-premise
prove I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
technology I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
positive I-premise
. O

Further O
, O
by B-premise
means I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
communication I-premise
tools I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
has I-premise
become I-premise
very I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
new I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

According B-premise
to I-premise
statistics I-premise
, I-premise
40 I-premise
% I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
met I-premise
even I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
partners I-premise
via I-premise
Internet I-premise
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
Internet B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
basic I-claim
tool I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
in I-claim
touch I-claim
with I-claim
old I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
new I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

However O
, O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
is O
that O
, O
by B-premise
communicating I-premise
via I-premise
Internet I-premise
or I-premise
phone I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
express I-premise
our I-premise
ideas I-premise
and I-premise
feelings I-premise
fully I-premise
, O
because O
during B-premise
such I-premise
conversations I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
words I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
completely I-premise
different I-premise
sense I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the B-claim
rate I-claim
of I-claim
divorces I-claim
is I-claim
increasing I-claim
day I-claim
by I-claim
day I-claim
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
I O
once O
again O
restate O
my O
position O
that O
the B-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
technology I-claim
impacted I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
among I-claim
people I-claim
very I-claim
positively I-claim
by I-claim
making I-claim
it I-claim
easier I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
comfortable I-claim
. O

Advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
machines O
instead O
of O
human O
to O
do O
the O
work O

The O
issue O
of O
whether O
using O
of O
machine O
are O
bring O
many O
advantages O
to O
society O
is O
of O
great O
concern O
to O
many O
people O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
although B-claim
using I-claim
machines I-claim
have I-claim
many I-claim
benefits I-claim
, O
we B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
ignore I-claim
its I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undoubted O
that O
machines B-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
many I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
machines B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
effective I-premise
than I-premise
human I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
like I-premise
human I-premise
, I-premise
machines I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
need I-premise
rest I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
means I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
employers I-premise
want I-premise
and I-premise
consistently I-premise
produce I-premise
high I-premise
quality I-premise
products I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
mistakes I-premise
. O

For O
another O
, O
using B-premise
machines I-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
company I-premise
's I-premise
money I-premise
. O

Because O
machines B-premise
never I-premise
ask I-premise
for I-premise
salary I-premise
, I-premise
over I-premise
- I-premise
time I-premise
pay I-premise
or I-premise
pension I-premise
, O
so O
employers B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
employee I-premise
's I-premise
welfare I-premise
. O

The B-premise
company I-premise
only I-premise
needs I-premise
some I-premise
technicians I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
sure I-premise
machines I-premise
are I-premise
working I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
track I-premise
or I-premise
replace I-premise
some I-premise
part I-premise
when I-premise
machines I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
working I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-claim
disadvantages I-claim
of I-claim
machines I-claim
that I-claim
bring I-claim
to I-claim
us I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
neglected I-claim
by I-claim
people I-claim
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
because B-premise
of I-premise
extensive I-premise
of I-premise
using I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
loss I-premise
their I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Especially B-premise
in I-premise
large I-premise
population I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
high I-premise
unemployment I-premise
rate I-premise
may I-premise
cause I-premise
crime I-premise
and I-premise
social I-premise
instability I-premise
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
, O
using B-premise
of I-premise
machines I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
pose I-premise
serious I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
energy I-premise
dissipation I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays B-premise
people I-premise
prefer I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
dish I-premise
- I-premise
washing I-premise
machine I-premise
to I-premise
wash I-premise
dishes I-premise
and I-premise
plates I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
hand I-premise
washing I-premise
. O

But O
they B-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
know I-premise
that I-premise
compared I-premise
with I-premise
hand I-premise
washing I-premise
dish I-premise
- I-premise
washing I-premise
machine I-premise
consume I-premise
at I-premise
least I-premise
2 I-premise
times I-premise
water I-premise
and I-premise
electricity I-premise
to I-premise
wash I-premise
these I-premise
tableware I-premise
. O

As O
you O
can O
imagine O
, O
if B-premise
thousands I-premise
of I-premise
families I-premise
use I-premise
dish I-premise
- I-premise
washing I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
many I-premise
water I-premise
and I-premise
how I-premise
much I-premise
electricity I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
wasted I-premise
! O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
we B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
deny I-claim
machines I-claim
are I-claim
play I-claim
a I-claim
vital I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim
living I-claim
and I-claim
working I-claim
, O
problems B-claim
posed I-claim
by I-claim
machines I-claim
should I-claim
draws I-claim
more I-claim

Celebrity B-premise

the I-premise
public I-premise

perceive I-premise
it I-premise
very I-premise
negatively I-premise

This O

that O
celebrities B-premise
who I-premise
received I-premise

alcohol I-premise
are I-premise

Therefore O

children B-claim
may I-claim
see I-claim
that I-claim
this I-claim

On O

an I-premise

a I-premise

Many B-premise

called I-premise
stars I-premise

various I-premise

This B-premise
may I-premise
confuse I-premise

not I-premise
choose I-premise

Recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
in O
regards O
to O
whether O
mobile O
phones O
have O
a O
negative O
effect O
in O
our O
social O
communication O
. O

Indeed O
, O
mobile O
phones O
have O
been O
widely O
used O
for O
people O
of O
all O
ages O
, O
bringing O
convenience O
and O
entertainment O
into O
our O
life O
. O

However O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
this B-claim
great I-claim
invention I-claim
causes I-claim
many I-claim
social I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
spending B-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
phones I-claim
may I-claim
exert I-claim
adverse I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
social I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
as B-premise
people I-premise
increasingly I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
and I-premise
relay I-premise
on I-premise
phones I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
interest I-premise
on I-premise
daily I-premise
activities I-premise
like I-premise
meeting I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
so O
that O
distraction B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
developed I-premise
during I-premise
study I-premise
or I-premise
social I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
continuous B-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
may I-premise
damage I-premise
both I-premise
eyesight I-premise
and I-premise
physical I-premise
posture I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
games I-premise
available I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
phone I-premise
and I-premise
many I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
aggressive I-premise
in I-premise
nature I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
" I-premise
Iron I-premise
man I-premise
" I-premise
. O

In B-premise
those I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
rewarded I-premise
for I-premise
being I-premise
more I-premise
violent I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
violence I-premise
is I-premise
repeated I-premise
again I-premise
and I-premise
again I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many B-premise
games I-premise
involve I-premise
children I-premise
helping I-premise
their I-premise
character I-premise
to I-premise
kill I-premise
or I-premise
shoot I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
many I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
increased I-premise
aggressive I-premise
feelings I-premise
, I-premise
thoughts I-premise
and I-premise
behaviours I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
the B-claim
hardship I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
developed I-claim
. O

However O
, O
other O
people O
may O
perceive O
this O
issue O
from O
different O
viewpoint O
. O

With B-premise
rapid I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
quick I-premise
electronic I-premise
communication I-premise
via I-premise
internet I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
as B-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
chatting I-premise
apps I-premise
available I-premise
online I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
" I-premise
Weichat I-premise
" I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
send I-premise
instant I-premise
messages I-premise
free I-premise
of I-premise
charge I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
their I-premise
phones I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
face I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
mobile B-claim
phones I-claim
have I-claim
shortened I-claim
the I-claim
distance I-claim
of I-claim
communication O
. O

After O
having O
considered O
all O
the O
problems O
that O
I O
have O
discussed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
finally O
draw O
a O
conclusion O
that O
although O
mobile B-claim
phones I-claim
brings I-claim
convenience I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
, O
they B-claim
also I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
some I-claim
social I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

Modern O
forms O
of O
communication O
; O
' O
electronic O
letter O
' O
Undoubtedly O
, O
the O
movement O
of O
modern O
forms O
of O
communication O
has O
changed O
better O
, O
which O
help O
people O
to O
interact O
to O
others O
, O
such O
as O
email O
and O
messaging O
without O
limitation O
time O
. O

I O
totally O
agree O
that O
using B-claim
of I-claim
these I-claim
soft I-claim
devices I-claim
have I-claim
cut I-claim
much I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
people I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
see I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
relatives I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
had I-claim
some I-claim
demerits I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
social I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Mentioned O
to O
societies O
life O
style O
, O
they B-premise
constantly I-premise
use I-premise
these I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
electronic I-premise
letter I-premise
for I-premise
making I-premise
fellowship I-premise
or I-premise
just I-premise
continuing I-premise
theirs I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
already I-premise
had I-premise
. O

Obviousness O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
other I-claim
ways I-claim
like I-claim
social I-claim
media I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
could I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
it I-claim
for I-claim
meeting I-claim
theirs I-claim
buddies I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
Twitter I-claim
and I-claim
Facebook I-claim
, I-claim
also I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
communication I-claim
become I-claim
feasible I-claim
and I-claim
limitless I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Another O
perspective O
, O
using B-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
facilities I-premise
has I-premise
influenced I-premise
netizens I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
themselves I-premise
becoming I-premise
unsociable I-premise
. O

It B-premise
caused I-premise
they I-premise
were I-premise
swept I-premise
away I-premise
by I-premise
virtual I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
do I-premise
much I-premise
social I-premise
live I-premise
interactions I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

The O
consequence O
of O
this O
case O
made O
some B-claim
people I-claim
become I-claim
geek I-claim
, I-claim
as I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
of I-claim
using I-claim
email I-claim
and I-claim
messaging I-claim
, I-claim
without I-claim
direct I-claim
contacts I-claim
. O

However O
, O
people B-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
own I-premise
minded I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
connection I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
relationship I-premise
, I-premise
meet I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
talk I-premise
by I-premise
face I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
directly I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
admittedly O
and O
strongly O
agree O
that O
the B-claim
merits I-claim
of I-claim
email I-claim
and I-claim
messaging I-claim
have I-claim
reduced I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
ours I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
communicate I-claim
to I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
we B-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
sure I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
gathering I-claim
with I-claim
our I-claim
colleague I-claim
. O

People O
should O
create O
a O
sense O
of O
co O
- O
operation O
in O
their O
children O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
children O
have O
an O
innocent O
mind O
, O
and O
they O
requires O
a O
proper O
guidance O
at O
a O
specific O
time O
to O
make O
them O
understand O
the O
value O
of O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
it O
is O
better O
to O
make O
them O
competitive O
, O
while O
other O
believes O
to O
make O
them O
co O
- O
operative O
. O

Both O
these O
factors O
have O
their O
own O
values O
, O
and O
have O
been O
discussed O
in O
detail O
below O
: O
Competitive B-claim
children I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
confident I-claim
enough I-claim
to I-claim
handle I-claim
the I-claim
situations I-claim
independently I-claim
. O

This O
factor O
initially O
arises O
from O
the O
school O
, O
where O
teacher O
encourages O
student O
to O
feel O
more O
competitive O
through O
the O
grading O
system O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
place O
where O
children O
are O
trying O
to O
get O
on O
the O
top O
by O
scoring O
the O
highest O
marks O
. O

This B-premise
factor I-premise
will I-premise
lead I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
successful I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
lives I-premise
ahead I-premise
, O
but O
will O
also O
restrict O
them O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

For O
example O
, O
MNCs B-premise
are I-premise
mainly I-premise
focusing I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
competitive I-premise
mind I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
difficulty I-premise
in I-premise
managing I-premise
the I-premise
situation I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
team I-premise
. O

However O
, O
those B-premise
who I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
operation I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
symbol I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
sensible I-premise
enough I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
lives I-premise
ahead I-premise
. O

Although O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
pace I-premise
and I-premise
an I-premise
eager I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
top I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
competitors I-premise
do I-premise
, O
but O
they B-claim
shall I-claim
have I-claim
an I-claim
art I-claim
of I-claim
managing I-claim
different I-claim
situations I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
help I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
team I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
though O
competitive B-premise
children I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
far I-premise
more I-premise
clever I-premise
and I-premise
faster I-premise
than I-premise
the I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
operative I-premise
child I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
initial I-premise
level I-premise
, O
but O
it B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
success I-premise
path I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
long I-premise
run I-premise
; O
while O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
co B-claim
- I-claim
operative I-claim
child I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
potential I-claim
of I-claim
structuring I-claim
and I-claim
implementing I-claim
new I-claim
and I-claim
innovative I-claim
ideas I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
help I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
team I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
people B-claim
should I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
sense I-claim
of I-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
operation I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
them I-claim
feel I-claim
more I-claim
accomplished I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Man O
to O
man O
interaction O
changed O
Nowadays O
, O
the O
variety O
of O
communication O
systems O
used O
widely O
. O

As O
technology O
develops O
, O
it O
has O
negative O
influences O
in O
many O
respects O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
that O
the B-claim
technology I-claim
has I-claim
large I-claim
positive I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
relationships I-claim
between I-claim
people I-claim
. O

The O
main O
advantage O
is O
that O
technology B-claim
has I-claim
enabled I-claim
people I-claim
stay I-claim
in I-claim
contact I-claim
with I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
more I-claim
closely I-claim
. O

While B-premise
public I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
or I-premise
smart I-premise
phone I-premise
to I-premise
share I-premise
information I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
at I-premise
different I-premise
positions I-premise
. O

Instead B-premise
of I-premise
using I-premise
letters I-premise
, I-premise
technology I-premise
advanced I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
gives I-premise
us I-premise
more I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
convenient I-premise
and I-premise
efficient I-premise
. O

More O
, O
even B-premise
if I-premise
family I-premise
members I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
different I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
also I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
to I-premise
connect I-premise
each I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
though I-premise
the I-premise
images I-premise
or I-premise
videos I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
feel I-premise
close I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
technology B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
essential I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
remote I-premise
districts I-premise
, I-premise
shared I-premise
the I-premise
valuable I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Another O
issue O
is O
that O
in O
the O
ever O
- O
accelerated O
updating O
of O
science O
and O
technology O
, O
technology B-premise
provides I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
establish I-premise
the I-premise
social I-premise
network I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
might I-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
pen I-premise
friends I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
now I-premise
, I-premise
thanks I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
social I-premise
networking I-premise
websites I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
someone I-premise
who I-premise
has I-premise
similar I-premise
interests I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
connect I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
touch I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
by I-premise
using I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
technology B-claim
is I-claim
beneficial I-claim
to I-claim
humanity I-claim
develops I-claim
positive I-claim
relationships I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
the B-claim
technology I-claim
has I-claim
more I-claim
optimal I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
interaction I-claim
, O
because O
it B-claim
helps I-claim
ordinary I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
new I-claim
friends I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
maintain I-claim
relationships I-claim
. O

Sense O
of O
cooperation O

In O
present O
educational O
system O
there O
are O
variety O
of O
competitions O
in O
academic O
area O
and O
athletic O
area O
for O
children O
to O
attend O
, O
which O
could O
stimulating O
the O
will O
of O
children O
to O
learn O
and O
to O
achieve O
the O
best O
of O
them O
, O
and O
also O
be O
able O
to O
teach O
them O
teamwork O
skill O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
is O
better O
to O
make O
children O
be O
competitive O
than O
cooperative O
, O
both O
the O
values O
have O
its O
arguments O
. O

A B-claim
strong I-claim
competition I-claim
sense I-claim
helps I-claim
children I-claim
having I-claim
urge I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
or I-claim
to I-claim
practice I-claim
for I-claim
being I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
among I-claim
peers I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
this I-claim
factor I-claim
is I-claim
initially I-claim
arises I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
schools I-claim
and I-claim
parents I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
encourage I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
the I-claim
highest I-claim
scores I-claim
through I-claim
the I-claim
grading I-claim
system I-claim
. O

Even O
though O
a B-premise
competitive I-premise
child I-premise
is I-premise
usually I-premise
more I-premise
motivated I-premise
to I-premise
pursue I-premise
a I-premise
goal I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
difficulties I-premise
independently I-premise
, O
but O
it B-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
risky I-premise
that I-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
becoming I-premise
too I-premise
competitive I-premise
to I-premise
cooperating I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

Being B-premise
competitive I-premise
leads I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
could I-premise
also I-premise
restrict I-premise
them I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
ways I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
it B-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
hard I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
competitive I-premise
person I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
or I-premise
manage I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
work I-premise
project I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
cooperation B-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
an I-claim
essential I-claim
quality I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
, I-claim
no I-claim
matter I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
activities I-claim
or I-claim
in I-claim
communities I-claim
. O

Having B-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
cooperating I-premise
spirit I-premise
helps I-premise
kids I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
and I-premise
get I-premise
along I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
gives I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
possibility I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
problems I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
a I-premise
goal I-premise
easily I-premise
by I-premise
working I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
in B-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
hardly I-premise
anyone I-premise
who I-premise
could I-premise
has I-premise
big I-premise
achievement I-premise

famous B-premise

despite I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise

deal I-premise

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
though O
competitive B-claim
child I-claim
would I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
motivation I-claim
and I-claim
perspective I-claim
that I-claim

success I-claim

it B-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise

once I-premise
they I-premise
enter I-premise

society I-premise
or I-premise
company I-premise
which I-premise
required I-premise
more I-premise
about I-premise
skill I-premise
of I-premise
team I-premise
work I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
schools B-claim
and I-claim
adults I-claim
should I-claim
put I-claim
a I-claim
sense I-claim
of I-claim
cooperation I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
them I-claim
becoming I-claim

Discuss O
both O

On O

with O
the O

people O
easily O
purchase O
the O

Although O
some O
people O
claim O
that O
the O
advantages O
of O
advertising O
are O
outweigh O
the O
advantages O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
advertisement B-claim
bring I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim
than I-claim
harms I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
most B-premise
advertisements I-premise
so I-premise
exaggerate I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
products I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
often I-premise
ignore I-premise
some I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
of I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
sell I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
all B-claim
of I-claim
things I-claim
are I-claim
advertised I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
ones I-claim
result I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
confusing I-claim
for I-claim
users I-claim
in I-claim
picking I-claim
out I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
suitable I-claim
goods I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
some B-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
shampoo I-premise
, I-premise
namely I-premise
Sunsilk I-premise
, I-premise
Clear I-premise
, I-premise
Dove I-premise
are I-premise
publicized I-premise
as I-premise
magic I-premise
items I-premise
to I-premise
recreate I-premise
injured I-premise
hair I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
other I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
not B-premise
all I-premise
customers I-premise
are I-premise
satisfied I-premise
with I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
bought I-premise
under I-premise
the I-premise
introduction I-premise
from I-premise
advertisement I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
undeniable I-claim
fact I-claim
that I-claim
advertising I-claim
market I-claim
gives I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
opportunities I-claim
from I-claim
producers I-claim
, I-claim
writers I-claim
to I-claim

cameramen I-claim
for I-claim
all I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
as I-claim
long I-claim
as I-claim
their I-claim
qualification I-claim
adapt I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
demands I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
advertisement B-claim
enables I-claim
to I-claim
support I-claim
users I-claim
in I-claim
getting I-claim
accustomed I-claim
to I-claim
enterprises I-claim
and I-claim
know I-claim
thoroughly I-claim
items I-claim
sold I-claim
from I-claim
these I-claim
producers I-claim
. O

Take B-premise
Coca I-premise
cola I-premise
for I-premise
an I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
drinking I-premise
firm I-premise
is I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
known I-premise
as I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
companies I-premise
invested I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
part I-premise

their I-premise
money I-premise
in I-premise

No B-premise
wonder I-premise
why I-premise
this I-premise

more I-premise

more I-premise
familiar I-premise

the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O

, O
online B-premise

is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
easiest I-premise
approaches I-premise
due I-premise

potential I-premise

such I-premise

To O

up O

everything O
has O
its O
own O
gains O

and O
advertisement O
is O
not O
an O
exception O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
advertising O
will O
be O
better O
if O
producers O
and O
advertisers O
are O
more O
honest O
in O
producing O
advertisements O
to O
give O

In O

this O

I O
agree O
that O
in B-claim

It O
is O
true O
while O
the B-premise
modern I-premise
artists I-premise
who I-premise
implement I-premise
their I-premise
creative I-premise
thinking I-premise
onto I-premise

Also O
, O
the B-premise
high I-premise
sum I-premise
which I-premise

receive I-premise
is I-premise
related I-premise

instead I-premise

On O
the O

modern B-premise

also I-premise
devote I-premise

find I-premise
a I-premise
unique I-premise

ordinary I-premise

In O

Moreover O

can I-claim
not I-claim
equalize I-claim
the I-claim
price I-claim

that O
the B-claim

I O
agree O
that O

can I-claim
not I-claim
take I-claim
steps I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
salary I-claim
between I-claim
modern I-claim
artists I-claim

Working O
Extended O
hours O
should O
restricted O
Working O
longer O
hours O
is O
becoming O
prevalent O
in O
these O
days O
. O

There O
is O
a O
saying O
in O
my O
native O
village O
, O
" O
Health O
is O
Wealth O
" O
. O

I O
believe O
many O
of O
people O
including O
me O
are O
not O
really O
considering O
the O
importance O
of O
health O
. O

The O
need O
for O
increased O
working O
hours O
might O
be O
because O
of O
enhanced O
competitive O
environment O
and O
desire O
to O
acquire O
much O
money O
and O
promotion O
. O

However O
, O
people B-claim
working I-claim
for I-claim
extended I-claim
hours I-claim
have I-claim
been I-claim
found I-claim
having I-claim
adverse I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
and I-claim
personal I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
a B-claim
balance I-claim
between I-claim
personal I-claim
and I-claim
professional I-claim
life I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
created I-claim
by I-claim
restricting I-claim
maximum I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
hours I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many O
of O
us O
would O
agree O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
people B-claim
; I-claim
who I-claim
prefer I-claim
working I-claim
longer I-claim
hours I-claim
, I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
find I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
. O

By B-premise
working I-premise
too I-premise
long I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
often I-premise
become I-premise
tired I-premise
, I-premise
lazy I-premise
and I-premise
reluctant I-premise
to I-premise
carry I-premise
out I-premise
physical I-premise
exercise I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
remain I-premise
fit I-premise
and I-premise
healthy I-premise
and I-premise
eventually I-premise
loose I-premise
health I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
sick I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-premise
become I-premise
extensively I-premise
addicted I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
workaholic I-premise
type I-premise
persons I-premise
. O

The B-premise
repercussion I-premise
are I-premise
so I-premise
severe I-premise
that I-premise
their I-premise
families I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
remain I-premise
deprived I-premise
off I-premise
their I-premise
attention I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
they I-premise
end I-premise
up I-premise
losing I-premise
balance I-premise
between I-premise
their I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
personal I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
these B-claim
workaholic I-claim
people I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
spend I-claim
time I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
contribution I-claim
of I-claim
society I-claim
by I-claim
actively I-claim
participating I-claim
in I-claim
any I-claim
social I-claim
campaign I-claim
. O

As O
they B-premise
usually I-premise
remain I-premise
busy I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
office I-premise
so O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
find I-premise
leisure I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
such I-premise
social I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
would I-premise
take I-premise
my I-premise
boss I-premise
's I-premise
example I-premise
; I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
working I-premise
for I-premise
extended I-premise
hours I-premise
in I-premise
office I-premise
for I-premise
many I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Recently B-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
health I-premise
and I-premise
personal I-premise
life I-premise
was I-premise
drastically I-premise
affected I-premise
as I-premise
he I-premise
broke I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
wife I-premise
and I-premise
his I-premise
family I-premise
life I-premise
has I-premise
totally I-premise
been I-premise
in I-premise
chaos I-premise
and I-premise
cries I-premise
. O

He B-premise
started I-premise
regretting I-premise
afterwards I-premise
and I-premise
now I-premise
trying I-premise
to I-premise
manage I-premise
his I-premise
work I-premise

but I-premise
it I-premise
seems I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
too I-premise
late I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
this O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
strongly I-claim
emphasis I-claim
and I-claim
recommend I-claim
, I-claim
Government I-claim
must I-claim
include I-claim
the I-claim
clause I-claim
of I-claim
maximum I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
hours I-claim
in I-claim
its I-claim
Labor I-claim
Law I-claim
and I-claim
enforce I-claim
to I-claim
all I-claim
companies I-claim
for I-claim
ensuring I-claim
their I-claim
employees I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
spend I-claim
extended I-claim
hours I-claim
in I-claim
companies I-claim
. O

This B-claim
will I-claim
help I-claim
in I-claim
uplift I-claim
of I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
bring I-claim
the I-claim
lost I-claim
equilibrium I-claim
between I-claim
personal I-claim
and I-claim
professional I-claim
life I-claim
of I-claim
each I-claim
individual I-claim
person I-claim
. O

A O
successful O
person O
is O
one O
who O
has O
earned O
a O

It O
's O
such O
a O

a O

person O
is O
one O
who O
has O
earned O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
especially O
in O
nowadays O
society O
. O

Each O
individual O
visualize O
success O
differently O
. O

Still O
, O
my B-claim
term I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
successful I-claim
man I-claim
is I-claim
one I-claim
who I-claim
has I-claim
certain I-claim
achievements I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
one I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
income I-claim
. O

Money B-premise
is I-premise
undeniably I-premise
pivotal I-premise
, O
but O
ways B-premise
of I-premise
earning I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
various I-premise
. O

A B-premise
person I-premise
's I-premise
great I-premise
prosperity I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
state I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
gained I-premise
it I-premise
ethically I-premise
by I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
a B-claim
man I-claim
can I-claim
only I-claim
achieve I-claim
his I-claim
accomplishment I-claim
through I-claim
hard I-claim
- I-claim
working I-claim
, I-claim
dedication I-claim
and I-claim
passion I-claim
. O

Whether B-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
personal I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
social I-premise
achievement I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
man I-premise
is I-premise
laudable I-premise
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the B-premise
more I-premise
beneficial I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
his I-premise
achievement I-premise
is I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
successful I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
considered I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Thomas B-premise
Edison I-premise
is I-premise
undeniably I-premise
considered I-premise
as I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
greatest I-premise
inventors I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
20th I-premise
century I-premise
since O
his B-premise
invention I-premise
's I-premise
productivity I-premise
is I-premise
countless I-premise
useful I-premise
for I-premise
mankind I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the B-premise
fact I-premise
of I-premise
knowing I-premise
a I-premise
man I-premise
's I-premise
utilization I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
money I-premise
remains I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
dark I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
judging B-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
by I-claim
his I-claim
income I-claim
is I-claim
difficult I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
success I-claim
aspect I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
using B-claim
only I-claim
money I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
scale I-claim
to I-claim
measure I-claim
a I-claim
man I-claim
's I-claim
success I-claim
is I-claim
impossible I-claim
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
essential I-claim
in I-claim
basic I-claim

Yet O
, O
it O
is O
the O

This O
argument O

true O
that O
people B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
swayed I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
advertising I-claim

buy I-claim
things I-claim
they I-claim

For O

in B-premise
most I-premise
asian I-premise
countries I-premise

the I-premise
sales I-premise

some I-premise
people I-premise

especially I-premise
adolescent I-premise
may I-premise
buy I-premise

from I-premise
their I-premise
favourite I-premise

support I-premise
their I-premise

instead I-premise

fill I-premise
their I-premise

. O

In O
addition O
, O
products B-premise
usually I-premise
look I-premise
more I-premise
gorgeous I-premise
and I-premise
with I-premise
good I-premise
quality I-premise
in I-premise
advertisement I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
goods I-premise
impulsively I-premise
without I-premise
a I-premise
second I-premise
thought I-premise
. O

A B-claim
good I-claim
advertisement I-claim
can I-claim
convince I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
believe I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
, I-claim
even I-claim
though I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
real I-claim
needs I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

And O
there B-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
people I-premise
purchase I-premise
particular I-premise
products I-premise
swayed I-premise
by I-premise
advertising I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
it I-premise
a I-premise
trend I-premise
to I-premise
follow I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
unnecessarily I-premise
need I-premise
it I-premise
. O

However O
, O
buying B-premise
habit I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
personal I-premise
things I-premise
for I-premise
individuals I-premise
, O
the B-claim
advertisement I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
only I-claim
cause I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
buy I-claim
, O
sometimes B-premise
it I-premise
depends I-premise
on I-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
needs I-premise
and I-premise
ability I-premise
of I-premise
consumption I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
unlikely I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
things I-premise
impulsively I-premise
for I-premise
adults I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
concern I-premise
of I-premise
arranging I-premise
disposable I-premise
income I-premise
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
allocate I-premise
the I-premise
money I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
doing I-premise
other I-premise
purchase I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children B-claim
and I-claim
adolescents I-claim
who I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
economic I-claim
independence I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
possible I-claim
to I-claim
buy I-claim
things I-claim
impulsively I-claim
without I-claim
considering I-claim
whether I-claim
they I-claim
need I-claim
it I-claim
or I-claim
not I-claim
, O
since O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
financial I-premise
pressure I-premise
from I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
ability I-premise
to I-premise
define I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
necessary I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
think O
buying B-claim
habit I-claim
is I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
choice I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
, I-claim
not I-claim
entirely I-claim
affected I-claim
by I-claim
advertisements I-claim
. O

But O
for B-premise
children I-premise
or I-premise
adolescents I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
mentally I-premise
develop I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
hard I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
swayed I-premise
by I-premise
advertising I-premise
. O

So O
it B-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
that I-claim
government I-claim
needs I-claim
to I-claim
impose I-claim
rules I-claim
on I-claim
particularly I-claim
advertisement I-claim
company I-claim
( I-claim
for I-claim
example I-claim
, I-claim
toys I-claim
company I-claim
) I-claim
to I-claim
avoid I-claim
youngster I-claim

have I-claim
bias I-claim
thought I-claim
on I-claim
what I-claim
they I-claim
really I-claim
need I-claim
. O

Schools O
should O
only O
teach O
children O
the O
academic O
subject O
People O
have O
many O
different O
views O
about O
what O
subjects O
should O
be O
taught O
in O
school O
. O

Although O
I O
accept O
that O
students O
have O
to O
study O
many O
subjects O
in O
school O
, O
I B-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
idea I-claim
that I-claim
unimportant I-claim
subjects I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
music I-claim
and I-claim
sports I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
got I-claim
rid I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
program I-claim
. O

Many O
people O
believe O
that O
students B-claim
only I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
academic I-claim
subjects I-claim
like I-claim
mathematics I-claim
, I-claim
physics I-claim
because O
these B-premise
subject I-premise
are I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
future I-premise
. O

This O
is O
understandable O
when B-premise
labor I-premise
market I-premise
now I-premise
has I-premise
high I-premise
competition I-premise
; I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
requirements I-premise
regard I-premise
of I-premise
qualification I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
unemployment I-premise
rate I-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
high I-premise
, O
so O
their O
parents B-premise
want I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
these I-premise
subjects I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Although O
those O
above O
reasons O
are O
acceptable O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
things I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
important I-premise
than I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Firstly O
, O
studying B-premise
music I-premise
, I-premise
art I-premise
or I-premise
sports I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
. O

This B-premise
enables I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
potentials I-premise
through I-premise
discovering I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
world I-premise
around I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
to B-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
in I-premise
labor I-premise
market I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
do I-premise
students I-premise
require I-premise
hard I-premise
skills I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
soft I-premise
skills I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
teamwork I-premise
, I-premise
presentation I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
through B-premise
taking I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
sport I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
team I-premise
spirit I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
lessons I-premise
about I-premise
teamwork I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
these B-claim
subjects I-claim
might I-claim
fulfil I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
ability I-claim
. O

Finally O
, O
children B-premise
's I-premise
future I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
depend I-premise
heavily I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
academic I-premise
subjects I-premise
they I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
result I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
efforts I-premise
and I-premise
capacity I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
the B-claim
academic I-claim
subjects I-claim
play I-claim
a I-claim
primary I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
nurturing I-claim
children I-claim
, O
it O
seem O
to O
me O
that O
the B-claim
effects I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
music I-claim
, I-claim
sports I-claim
are I-claim
profound I-claim
. O

Internet O
will O
end O
the O
era O
of O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
Digital O
media O
has O
been O
extremely O
popular O
among O
people O
around O
the O
globe O
. O

With O
this O
advancement O
, O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
are O
struggling O
to O
justify O
their O
existence O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
traditional O
paper O
media O
will O
come O
to O
an O
end O
very O
soon O
due O
to O
the O
increased O
usage O
of O
internet O
based O
media O
. O

But O
many O
other O
still O
thinks O
they O
are O
going O
to O
stay O
. O

I O
agree O
to O
the O
argument O
that O
newspapers B-claim
and I-claim
magazines I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
history I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
. O

I O
will O
establish O
my O
view O
by O
analysing O
how O
internet B-claim
presents I-claim
the I-claim
information I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
current I-claim
affair I-claim
so I-claim
fast I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
accessibility I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
historical I-claim
news I-claim
. O

A B-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
responsibility I-premise
of I-premise
media I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
publish I-premise
information I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
current I-premise
affairs I-premise
as I-premise
quickly I-premise
as I-premise
possible I-premise
specially I-premise
when I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
crisis I-premise
. O

This B-premise
helps I-premise
readers I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
updated I-premise
and I-premise
act I-premise
accordingly I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
the I-premise
aircraft I-premise
MH I-premise
370 I-premise
went I-premise
missing I-premise
, I-premise
everyone I-premise
wanted I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
details I-premise
about I-premise
this I-premise
tragic I-premise
incident I-premise
. O

The B-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
families I-premise
of I-premise
passengers I-premise
and I-premise
crews I-premise
were I-premise
impatient I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
truth I-premise
. O

In B-premise
such I-premise
situations I-premise
, I-premise
newspapers I-premise
and I-premise
magazines I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
respond I-premise
as I-premise
fast I-premise
as I-premise
digital I-premise
media I-premise
. O

Instead B-premise
of I-premise
waiting I-premise
for I-premise
next I-premise
publication I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
trustworthy I-premise
information I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
current I-premise
incidents I-premise
from I-premise
internet I-premise
within I-premise
an I-premise
hour I-premise
or I-premise
two I-premise
. O

This O
explains O
why O
digital B-claim
media I-claim
will I-claim
rule I-claim
over I-claim
paper I-claim
and I-claim
magazines I-claim
. O

People B-claim
often I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
access I-claim
news I-claim
from I-claim
past I-claim
for I-claim
various I-claim
reasons I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
prepare I-claim
for I-claim
research I-claim
, I-claim
satisfy I-claim
interest I-claim
, I-claim
etc I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
one B-premise
research I-premise
fellow I-premise
may I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
village I-premise
named I-premise
Oramaki I-premise
in I-premise
Japan I-premise
was I-premise
suffering I-premise
after I-premise
Second I-premise
World I-premise
War I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
this I-premise
sort I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
from I-premise
past I-premise
in I-premise
newspapers I-premise
and I-premise
magazines I-premise
as I-premise
one I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
before I-premise
where I-premise
to I-premise
look I-premise
at I-premise
. O

But O
internet B-premise
provides I-premise
efficient I-premise
search I-premise
facility I-premise
where I-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
search I-premise
the I-premise
topic I-premise
and I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
details I-premise
. O

This B-premise
feature I-premise
of I-premise
digital I-premise
media I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
supported I-premise
by I-premise
newspapers I-premise
and I-premise
magazines I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the B-claim
fast I-claim
responding I-claim
internet I-claim
media I-claim
with I-claim
vast I-claim
information I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
replacing I-claim
newspapers I-claim
and I-claim
magazines I-claim
as I-claim
new I-claim
and I-claim
information I-claim
provider I-claim
for O
valid O
reasons O

the I-claim
current I-claim
infrastructure I-claim
and I-claim
mindset I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim

To O
begin O
with O
, O
children B-claim
from I-claim
poorer I-claim

habits I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim

. O

Moreover O
, O
these B-premise
people I-premise

a I-premise

As O
a O

For O

of I-premise
the I-premise
terroristic I-premise
groups I-premise
try I-premise

the B-premise
person I-premise

a I-premise

which I-premise

In O
this O

have I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim

on I-claim
their I-claim
later I-claim
life I-claim

Secondly O
, O
children B-claim
from I-claim

better I-claim

how I-claim

because O
they B-premise
use I-premise
it I-premise
a I-premise

Finally O
, O
wealthy B-claim

For O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
disagree I-claim

the I-claim
opinion I-claim
that I-claim

more I-claim
successful I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
life I-claim
due O
to O
aforementioned O
reasons O
. O

Recent O
medical O
problems O
and O
sedentary O
lifestyle O
. O

It O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
modern B-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
facing I-claim
up I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
health I-claim
problems I-claim
and I-claim
ailments I-claim
than I-claim
before I-claim
. O

Many O
people O
claim O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
sedentary I-claim
lifestlyle I-claim
. O

However O
, O
while O
I O
accept O
that O
sedentary O
lifestyle O
is O
one O
of O
the O
key O
factors O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
some O
other O
factors O
are O
having O
even O
a O
greater O
impact O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
sedentary B-claim
lifestyle I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
many I-claim
serious I-claim
health I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

The B-premise
main I-premise
reason I-premise
why I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
becoming I-premise
so I-premise
addicted I-premise
to I-premise
sitting I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
homes I-premise
even I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
day I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
advance I-premise
technology I-premise
. O

In B-premise
earlier I-premise
times I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
the I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
entertainment I-premise
tools I-premise
were I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
large I-premise
numbers I-premise
and I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
required I-premise
physical I-premise
presence I-premise
and O
as O
a O
result O
they B-premise
had I-premise
more I-premise
outdoor I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
inhabitants I-premise
of I-premise
cities I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
spending I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
sitting I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
TV I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
tools I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
are O
some O
other O
causes O
why O
people B-claim
are I-claim
experiencing I-claim
serious I-claim
medical I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-premise
environment I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
modern I-premise
world I-premise
polluted I-premise
very I-premise
significantly I-premise
from I-premise
greenhouse I-premise
gas I-premise
emissions I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
gasses I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
suffering I-premise
from I-premise
allergy I-premise
because I-premise
of I-premise
these I-premise
gasses I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
foods B-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
low I-premise
quality I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
fast I-premise
foods I-premise
, I-premise
junk I-premise
foods I-premise
and I-premise
any I-premise
genetically I-premise
modified I-premise
ones I-premise
are I-premise
influencing I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
health I-premise
very I-premise
negatively I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
life B-premise
becoming I-premise
more I-premise
stressful I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
recent I-premise
problems I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
traffic I-premise
gam I-premise
, I-premise
traffic I-premise
accidents I-premise
and I-premise
others I-premise
. O

Given O
these O
evidences O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
people B-claim
are I-claim
facing I-claim
up I-claim

many I-claim
recently I-claim
appeared I-claim
illnesses I-claim
due O

Problems O

benefits O
of O
international O
tourism O
Along O
with O
the O
advancement O
of O
long O
- O
distance O
transportation O
, O
international O
tourism O
has O
boomed O
in O
the O
last O
few O
decades O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
this O
has O
brought O
more O
problems O
than O
benefits O
. O

I O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

I O
admit O
that O
tourism B-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
natural I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
the I-premise
needs I-premise
of I-premise
tourists I-premise
, I-premise
local I-premise
governments I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
build I-premise
more I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
infrastructures I-premise
around I-premise
tourist I-premise
attractions I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
may I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
destruction I-premise
of I-premise
natural I-premise
habitats I-premise
. O

Tourism B-premise
also I-premise
creates I-premise
more I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
waste I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
growing I-premise
emission I-premise
of I-premise
greenhouse I-premise
gases I-premise
, I-premise
dumped I-premise
leftovers I-premise
and I-premise
overuse I-premise
of I-premise
water I-premise
, I-premise
power I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
energy I-premise
in I-premise
luxurious I-premise
hotels I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
these O
grounds O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
tourism B-premise
puts I-premise
great I-premise
pressure I-premise
on I-premise
ecosystem I-premise
and I-premise
local I-premise
resources I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
encouraged I-premise
. O

However O
, O
flourishing B-claim
tourism I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
place I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
very I-claim
rewarding I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
local I-claim
economy I-claim
. O

Holiday B-premise
makers I-premise
flocking I-premise
to I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
bound I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
on I-premise
tickets I-premise
of I-premise
attractions I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
food I-premise
, I-premise
accommodation I-premise
, I-premise
transportation I-premise
and I-premise
entertainment I-premise
. O

Both B-premise
local I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
governments I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
through I-premise
these I-premise
services I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
employment I-premise
opportunities I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
created I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

I O
also O
believe O
the B-premise
revenue I-premise
earned I-premise
form I-premise
tourism I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
in I-premise
turn I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
protect I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-claim
increasing I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
tourism I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
boon I-claim
to I-claim
travelers I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
. O

The B-premise
provision I-premise
of I-premise
direct I-premise
airlines I-premise
makes I-premise
it I-premise
possible I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise
conveniently I-premise
and I-premise
comfortably I-premise
. O

With B-premise
adequate I-premise
local I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
services I-premise
available I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
spend I-premise
more I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
holidays I-premise
having I-premise
fun I-premise
and I-premise
relaxing I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
both B-premise
locals I-premise
and I-premise
tourists I-premise
can I-premise
experience I-premise
more I-premise
cultures I-premise
than I-premise
ever I-premise
before I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
open I-premise
- I-premise
minded I-premise
to I-premise
eliminate I-premise
preconceptions I-premise
and I-premise
deepen I-premise
mutual I-premise
understanding I-premise
among I-premise
nations I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
prosperity I-claim
of I-claim
tourism I-claim
can I-claim
provide I-claim
benefits I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
global I-claim
scale I-claim
. O

Although O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
inevitable I-claim
problems I-claim
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
outweighed I-premise
by I-premise
advantages I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
tackled I-premise
if I-premise
proper I-premise
measures I-premise
are I-premise
taken I-premise
. O

How O
to O
learn O
children O
more O
efficiently O
Education O
is O
undeniably O
pivotal O
for O
an O
individual O
. O

Although O
, O
it O
is O
agreed O
that O
learning O
by O
watching O
TV O
is O
more O
effective O
to O
some O
children O
, O
I O
find O
it O
difficult O
not O
to O
oppose O
against O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
students O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
TVs O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
traditional B-claim
education I-claim
has I-claim
its I-claim
stand I-claim
for I-claim
most I-claim
appropriate I-claim
method I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
physical B-claim
inactivity I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
encouraged I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
aim I-claim
of I-claim
bettering I-claim
youngsters I-claim
' I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
classic B-premise
teaching I-premise
methods I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
scientifically I-premise
proven I-premise
and I-premise
utilized I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
mode I-premise
of I-premise
educate I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
. O

Technology B-premise
and I-premise
its I-premise
advance I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
degrees I-premise
, I-premise
have I-premise
influenced I-premise
the I-premise
educational I-premise
industry I-premise
positively I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it B-premise
has I-premise
not I-premise
changed I-premise
the I-premise
importance I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
' I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

The O
fact O
that O
students B-premise
nowadays I-premise
do I-premise
their I-premise
homework I-premise
or I-premise
researches I-premise
on I-premise
computers I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
libraries I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
illustration I-premise
for I-premise
this I-premise
. O

Yet B-premise
, I-premise
monitors I-premise
are I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
replace I-premise
the I-premise
appearance I-premise
of I-premise
educators I-premise
since O
their B-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
adaptability I-premise
is I-premise
priceless I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
teacher B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
switched I-claim
with I-claim
some I-claim
unconscious I-claim
screens I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
watching B-claim
television I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
passive I-claim
action I-claim
and I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
promoted I-claim
by I-claim
increasing I-claim
periods I-claim
spent I-claim
on I-claim
it I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children B-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
had I-premise
such I-premise
activities I-premise
that I-premise
interrelate I-premise
to I-premise
creativity I-premise
, I-premise
cooperation I-premise
, I-premise
competition I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
perform I-premise
significantly I-premise
better I-premise
in I-premise
general I-premise
terms I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
conducted I-premise
experiment I-premise
indicates I-premise
out I-premise
- I-premise
performance I-premise
in I-premise
skills I-premise
like I-premise
differentiate I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
plants I-premise
or I-premise
animals I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
that I-premise
experienced I-premise
various I-premise
activities I-premise
in I-premise
nature I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
spent I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
time I-premise
watching I-premise
documentaries I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
such B-premise
activities I-premise
can I-premise
equip I-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
necessary I-premise
skill I-premise
that I-premise
is I-premise
useful I-premise
for I-premise
his I-premise
future I-premise
career I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
learning B-claim
by I-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
suits I-claim
some I-claim
children I-claim
, O
kids B-claim
should I-claim
never I-claim
be I-claim
encourage I-claim
to I-claim
engage I-claim
in I-claim
such I-claim
passive I-claim
activity I-claim
. O

School B-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
applying I-claim
traditional I-claim
teaching I-claim
procedure I-claim
since I-claim
for I-claim
ages I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
it B-claim
still I-claim
performs I-claim
at I-claim
its I-claim
best I-claim
to I-claim
equip I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
with I-claim
essential I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

The O
option O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
is O
advantage O
or O
disadvantage O

Undoubtedly O
this O
is O
an O
era O
of O
internet O
which O
impacts O
one O
's O
personal O
as O
well O
as O
professional O
life O
. O

The O
effect O
is O
seen O
more O
on O
the O
developed O
countries O
where O
people O
choose O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
instead O
of O
going O
to O
office O
or O
university O
. O

Some O
consider O
this O
approach O
to O
be O
an O
advantage O
while O
others O
reject O
this O
as O
a O
disadvantage O
. O

Both O
the O
points O
of O
views O
will O
be O
discussed O
in O
order O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the B-premise
benefit I-premise
that I-premise
professionals I-premise
or I-premise
students I-premise
get I-premise
by I-premise
connecting I-premise
from I-premise
home I-premise
is I-premise
enormous I-premise
. O

For O
one O
, O
it B-premise
helps I-premise
working I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
work I-premise
life I-premise
balance I-premise
. O

The O
best O
example O
is O
the B-premise
new I-premise
mother I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
join I-premise
her I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
take I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
her I-premise
baby I-premise
. O

People B-premise
also I-premise
get I-premise
the I-premise
desired I-premise
flexibility I-premise
in I-premise
terms I-premise
of I-premise
working I-premise
hours I-premise
. O

For B-premise
students I-premise
too I-premise
, I-premise
studying I-premise
from I-premise
home I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
attractive I-premise
option I-premise
. O

They B-premise
save I-premise
the I-premise
travelling I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
Universities I-premise
and I-premise
utilize I-premise
that I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
. O

In B-premise
a I-premise
busy I-premise
city I-premise
like I-premise
Tokyo I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
waste I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
travelling I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
enjoy I-claim
by I-claim
working I-claim
or I-claim
studying I-claim
from I-claim
home I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
obvious I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
one O
part O
of O
the O
society O
, O
has O
doubt O
over O
the O
productivity O
of O
people O
who O
prefers O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
. O

Many O
employers O
argue O
that O
once B-premise
an I-premise
employee I-premise
works I-premise
from I-premise
isolation I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
spends I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
communication I-premise
via I-premise
phone I-premise
or I-premise
email I-premise
with I-premise
colleagues I-premise
. O

This B-premise
harms I-premise
an I-premise
employee I-premise
's I-premise
deliverable I-premise
. O

Teachers B-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
students I-premise
get I-premise
affected I-premise
too I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
clear I-premise
their I-premise
doubts I-premise
in I-premise
study I-premise
topics I-premise
instantly I-premise
. O

Due O
to O
this O
they O
lag O
in O
their O
studies O
. O

These B-claim
factors I-claim
affect I-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
work I-claim
or I-claim
study I-claim
from I-claim
home I-claim
. O

Following O
both O
the O
point O
of O
views O
, O

the B-claim
option I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
or I-claim
studying I-claim
from I-claim
home I-claim
is I-claim
thought I-claim
to I-claim
provide I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim
than I-claim
drawbacks I-claim
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
people O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
internet O
to O
work O
or O
study O
and O
improve O
on O
the O
disadvantages O
into O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Some O
celebrities O
misguide O
young O
people O

some O
guide O
them O

Some O

think O
that O

are O
known O
for O
their O
glamorous O

rather O
than O
the O
work O
they O
do O
. O

While O
I O
agree O
this O
will O
bring O
negative O

on O
the O
younger O
generation O
, O
this B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
necessarily I-claim
the I-claim
case I-claim
for I-claim
those I-claim

jobs I-claim
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
some B-premise
celebrities I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
off I-premise
their I-premise
images I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
some B-premise
movie I-premise
starts I-premise
enjoy I-premise
wearing I-premise
luxury I-premise
brand I-premise
clothes I-premise
and I-premise
showing I-premise
their I-premise
expensive I-premise
life I-premise
style I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
media I-premise
, I-premise
thereby I-premise
gaining I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
attention I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
continue I-premise
to I-premise
behave I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
create I-premise
a I-premise
misleading I-premise
image I-premise
to I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
may I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
extraordinary I-premise
life I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
achieved I-premise
without I-premise
hard I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
the B-claim
attention I-claim
of I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
may I-claim
become I-claim
focused I-claim
on I-claim
chasing I-claim
the I-claim
dream I-claim
of I-claim
celebrity I-claim
status I-claim
. O

This O
is O
detrimental O
to O
study O
and O
work O
ethics O
and O
habits O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
other B-claim
celebrities I-claim
do I-claim
set I-claim
up I-claim
role I-claim
models I-claim
to I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
visible I-claim
accomplishments I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
celebrities B-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
sports I-premise
player I-premise
whose I-premise
performance I-premise
and I-premise
professional I-premise
skills I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
directly I-premise
seen I-premise
by I-premise
their I-premise
fans I-premise
. O

This O
means O
that O
people B-premise
understand I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
great I-premise
deal I-premise
of I-premise
efforts I-premise
on I-premise
training I-premise
is I-premise
directly I-premise
linked I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
results I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
this B-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
made I-premise
celebrity I-premise
can I-premise
inspire I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
talents I-premise
through I-premise
application I-premise
and I-premise
perseverance I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
other B-premise
celebrities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
musician I-premise
also I-premise
have I-premise
achieved I-premise
great I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
career I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
Michael I-premise
Jackson I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
his I-premise
works I-premise
are I-premise
widely I-premise
spread I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
extremely I-premise
welcomed I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
younger I-premise
generation I-premise
. O

His B-premise
songs I-premise
spread I-premise
the I-premise
idea I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
should I-premise
care I-premise
about I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
suggests I-premise
to I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
member I-premise
of I-premise
society I-premise
. O

In O
summary O
, O
although O
some B-claim
celebrities I-claim
misguide I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
by I-claim
showing I-claim
their I-claim
external I-claim
wealth I-claim
and I-claim
appearance I-claim
, O
other B-claim
celebrities I-claim
do I-claim
lead I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
direction I-claim
. O

Children O
can O
effectively O
learn O
from O
watching O
television O
TV O
is O
an O
immense O
source O
of O
information O
and O
pupils O
can O
learn O
and O
develop O
various O
skills O
by O
watching O
it O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
by B-claim
allowing I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
watch I-claim
TV I-claim
at I-claim
both I-claim
school I-claim
and I-claim
house I-claim
can I-claim
adversely I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
overall I-claim
growth I-claim
. O

If B-claim
children I-claim
spend I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
front I-claim
of I-claim
TV I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
negatively I-claim
impact I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
and I-claim
study I-claim
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
TV B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
prime I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
data I-premise
and I-premise
information I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
international I-premise
and I-premise
local I-premise
news I-premise
channels I-premise
like I-premise
BBC I-premise
, I-premise
CNBC I-premise
, I-premise
Etv I-premise
Gujarati I-premise
, I-premise
Etv I-premise
Marathi I-premise
etc I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
individuals I-premise
updated I-premise
about I-premise
latest I-premise
happenings I-premise
. O

By B-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
, I-claim
children I-claim
can I-claim
develop I-claim
skills I-claim
in I-claim
extra I-claim
- I-claim
curriculum I-claim
activities I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
Cooking B-premise
programs I-premise
teach I-premise
about I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
new I-premise
dishes I-premise
and I-premise
similarly I-premise
, I-premise
sports I-premise
events I-premise
like I-premise
cricket I-premise
, I-premise
football I-premise
can I-premise
teach I-premise
leadership I-premise
skills I-premise
, I-premise
team I-premise
building I-premise
skills I-premise
, I-premise
communication I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
many I-premise
more I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
jobs I-premise
. O

But O
on O
other O
hand O
, O
watching B-claim
TV I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
continuously I-claim
long I-claim
hours I-claim
can I-claim
adversely I-claim
impact I-claim
children I-claim
health I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
poor I-premise
eyesight I-premise
in I-premise
early I-premise
ages I-premise
of I-premise
childhood I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
develop I-premise
back I-premise
pain I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
watch I-premise
restrictive I-premise
programs I-premise
not I-premise
allowed I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
ages I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
major I-premise
psychological I-premise
consequences I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
times I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
get I-premise
addictive I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
programs I-premise
like I-premise
Cartoon I-premise
channels I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
baseball I-premise
and I-premise
easily I-premise
get I-premise
distracted I-premise
from I-premise
study I-premise
during I-premise
exam I-premise
period I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
can I-premise
seriously I-premise
impact I-premise
their I-premise
grades I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
demerits B-claim
of I-claim
watching I-claim
TV I-claim
outweigh I-claim
its I-claim
merits I-claim
and O
thus O
if B-claim
students I-claim
were I-claim
allowed I-claim
to I-claim
freely I-claim
watch I-claim
TV I-claim
without I-claim
any I-claim
proper I-claim
controls I-claim
by I-claim
parents I-claim
or I-claim
teachers I-claim

then I-claim
it I-claim
would I-claim
produce I-claim
more I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
. O

Old O
and O
young O
workers O
Throughout O
human O
history O

, O
the O
offspring O
has O
always O
proved O
its O
stronger O
adaptability O
and O
advancement O
than O
its O
predecessor O
. O

This O
is O
still O
true O
in O
the O
industrial O
society O
nowadays O
, O
where O
younger O
workers O
are O
preferably O
employed O
and O
promoted O
rather O
than O
over-50 O
workers O
. O

There O
are O
three O
reasons O
that O
can O
explain O
their O
unresponsiveness O
to O
the O
modern O
workplace O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
old B-claim
workers I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
patch I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
younger I-claim
ones I-claim
for I-claim
their I-claim
unchanged I-claim
paradigm I-claim
. O

The B-premise
old I-premise
were I-premise
raised I-premise
in I-premise
poverty I-premise
, I-premise
probably I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
war I-premise
, I-premise
look I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
from I-premise
a I-premise
negative I-premise
and I-premise
pessimistic I-premise
point I-premise
of I-premise
view I-premise
. O

The B-premise
misery I-premise
is I-premise
so I-premise
ingrained I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
mind I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
refuse I-premise
to I-premise
change I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
more I-premise
precisely I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
accept I-premise
the I-premise
existence I-premise
of I-premise
such I-premise
modernity I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
most B-premise
would I-premise
rather I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
piece I-premise
together I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
machine I-premise
than I-premise
have I-premise
it I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
a I-premise
robot I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
disbelief I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
efficiency I-premise
and I-premise
safety I-premise
compared I-premise
with I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
capability I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
their B-claim
unresponsiveness I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
attributed I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
attitude I-claim
towards I-claim
life I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
that B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
deteriorating I-premise
health I-premise
and I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
enthusiasm I-premise
comes I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
taste I-premise
for I-premise
monotony I-premise
and I-premise
safe I-premise
ideology I-premise
. O

This B-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
all I-premise
means I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
outweigh I-premise
by I-premise
youngsters I-premise
' I-premise
adventurousness I-premise
and I-premise
bravery I-premise
. O

Blatantly B-premise
seen I-premise
, I-premise
success I-premise
of I-premise
most I-premise
companies I-premise
stems I-premise
from I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
whose I-premise
enterprising I-premise
ideas I-premise
that I-premise
catch I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
is I-premise
regarded I-premise
as I-premise
wind I-premise
of I-premise
refreshment I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
knowledge B-claim
is I-claim
worth I-claim
mentioning I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
key I-claim
factor I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
young I-claim
workers I-claim
outrank I-claim
the I-claim
elderly I-claim
. O

Who B-premise
would I-premise
the I-premise
employer I-premise
choose I-premise
, I-premise
an I-premise
old I-premise
man I-premise
with I-premise
old I-premise
- I-premise
fashioned I-premise
education I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
young I-premise
man I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
good I-premise
at I-premise
fundermentaly I-premise
subject I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
knows I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
program I-premise
or I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
speak I-premise
foreign I-premise
languages I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
to I-premise
undermine I-premise
old I-premise
workers I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
their I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
authority I-premise
over I-premise
such I-premise
basically I-premise
required I-premise
fields I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
day I-premise
and I-premise
age I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
incompetence I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
modern I-premise
workplace I-premise
. O

All O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
workers B-claim
over I-claim
50 I-claim
have I-claim
proven I-claim
themselves I-claim
subordinate I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
following I-claim
generation I-claim
in I-claim
all I-claim
aspects I-claim
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
of I-claim
great I-claim
importance I-claim
to I-claim
remain I-claim
the I-claim
harmonious I-claim
coexistence I-claim
of I-claim
both I-claim
sides I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
smooth I-claim
sailing I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
company I-claim
. O

Machines O
- O
positive O
or O
negative O
for O
humans O
Advancements O
in O
technology O
have O
touched O
new O
heights O
in O
past O
few O
decades O
. O

This O
can O
be O
seen O
no O
where O
clearer O
than O
in O
increasing O
use O
of O
machines O
now O
a O
days O
. O

These O
machines O
reduce O
the O
physical O
work O
done O
by O
humans O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
development O
while O
others O
believe O
it O
to O
be O
disadvantageous O
for O
humans O
. O

Both O
sides O
will O
be O
critiqued O
before O
a O
reasoned O
conclusion O
is O
reached O
. O

It O
is O
felt O
by O
many O
that O
the B-claim
usage I-claim
of I-claim
machines I-claim
is I-claim
harmful I-claim
for I-claim
health I-claim
of I-claim
humans I-claim
since O
machines B-premise
decrease I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
people I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
many I-premise
institutions I-premise
staircases I-premise
are I-premise
replaced I-premise
by I-premise
lifts I-premise
now I-premise
a I-premise
days I-premise
. O

People B-premise
opt I-premise
for I-premise
elevators I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
climbing I-premise
one I-premise
or I-premise
two I-premise
flight I-premise
of I-premise
stairs I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
confirmed I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
researches I-premise
that I-premise
daily I-premise
usage I-premise
of I-premise
elevators I-premise
in I-premise
workplaces I-premise
promotes I-premise
obesity I-premise
. O

So O
this B-premise
example I-premise
clearly I-premise
shows I-premise
the I-premise
linkage I-premise
between I-premise
using I-premise
machines I-premise
and I-premise
adverse I-premise
health I-premise
effects I-premise
. O

On O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
, O
many O
people O
believe O
that O
usage B-premise
of I-premise
machines I-premise
makes I-premise
work I-premise
easier I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
time I-premise
is I-premise
consumed I-premise
for I-premise
doing I-premise
similar I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
the I-premise
example I-premise
of I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
food I-premise
processors I-premise
in I-premise
kitchens I-premise
. O

The B-premise
work I-premise
of I-premise
chopping I-premise
, I-premise
blending I-premise
, I-premise
grating I-premise
, I-premise
kneading I-premise
has I-premise
become I-premise
so I-premise
easy I-premise
that I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
imagine I-premise
their I-premise
lives I-premise
without I-premise
this I-premise
simple I-premise
machine I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
homes I-premise
. O

Thus O
it O
is O
very O
obvious O
that O
using B-claim
machines I-claim
makes I-claim
daily I-claim
tasks I-claim
less I-claim
time I-claim
consuming I-claim
and I-claim
less I-claim
cumbersome I-claim
. O

After O
analyzing O
these O
two O
points O
of O
view O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
using B-claim
machines I-claim
is I-claim
advantageous I-claim
as O
machines B-claim
make I-claim
work I-claim
easy I-claim
and I-claim
smooth I-claim
. O

The B-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
health I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
put I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
back I-claim
seat I-claim
because O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
other I-premise
ways I-premise
to I-premise
exercise I-premise
and I-premise
stay I-premise
healthy I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
in O
coming O
time O
people O
will O
enjoy O
using O
more O
and O
more O
machines O
and O
will O
choose O
alternative O
ways O
to O
stay O
disease O
free O
. O

Way O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
traffic O
? O

Big O
cities O
nowadays O
can O
be O
described O
as O
melting O
pots O
. O

The O
problem O
off O
traffic O
overload O
, O
caused O
by O
overpopulation O
, O
has O
aroused O
interest O
of O
many O
city O
planners O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
only O
if O
the O
demand O
to O
go O
out O
on O
the O
street O
is O
cut O
down O
can O
we O
solve O
the O
seemingly O
insurmountable O
issue O
of O
traffic O
gridlock O
. O

However O
, O
I O
have O
to O
profoundly O
disagree O
for O
there O
are O
still O
two O
viable O
solutions O
besides O
besides O
this O
way O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
public B-claim
transport I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
key I-claim
factor I-claim
to I-claim
minimize I-claim
the I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
vehicles I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
street I-claim
. O

Buses B-premise
and I-premise
trains I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
phased I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
streets I-premise
for I-premise
quite I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
proven I-premise
themselves I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
candidates I-premise
among I-premise
all I-premise
options I-premise
. O

Apparently O
, O
a B-premise
bus I-premise
can I-premise
carry I-premise
no I-premise
less I-premise
than I-premise
30 I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
a I-premise
train I-premise
can I-premise
carry I-premise
as I-premise
much I-premise
as I-premise
nine I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
ten I-premise
times I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
number I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
to I-premise
mention I-premise
the I-premise
fact I-premise
that I-premise
highway I-premise
train I-premise
is I-premise
operated I-premise
underground I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
leaves I-premise
the I-premise
street I-premise
above I-premise
with I-premise
buses I-premise
and I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
fuel I-premise
- I-premise
based I-premise
vehicles I-premise
. O

Together O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
lessen I-premise
the I-premise
crowded I-premise
image I-premise
in I-premise
most I-premise
cities I-premise
nowadays I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
rarely O
do O
we O
realize O
the O
helpful O
existence O
of O
urban O
areas O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
if B-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
enormous I-premise
shopping I-premise
malls I-premise
or I-premise
universities I-premise
were I-premise
relocated I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
commuter I-premise
belt I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
street I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
les I-premise
burstling I-premise
and I-premise
overly I-premise
- I-premise
teemed I-premise
as I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
now I-premise
. O

As O
a O
rule O
of O
thumb O
, O
huge B-premise
centers I-premise
of I-premise
attention I-premise
distributed I-premise
equally I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
wide I-premise
region I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
residential I-premise
areas I-premise
will I-premise
come I-premise
along I-premise
thus I-premise
exert I-premise
less I-premise
pressure I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
facilities I-premise
. O

The B-claim
city I-claim
itself I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
absolved I-claim
of I-claim
enduring I-claim
the I-claim
influx I-claim
of I-claim
immigrants I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
unemployed I-claim
people I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
city B-claim
planner I-claim
can I-claim
still I-claim
opt I-claim
for I-claim
non I-claim
- I-claim
personal I-claim
vehicle I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
exploitation I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
suburb I-claim
areas I-claim
. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended O
to O
put O
forward O
such O
solution O
, O
especially O
in O
some O
developing O
countries O
like O
Vietnam O
or O
China O
, O
with O
the O
ever O
- O
growing O
demand O
for O
job O
or O
education O
. O

Effect O
of O
celebrities O
on O
youth O
Young O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O
are O
greatly O
influenced O
by O
media O
and O
celebrities O
. O

These O
celebrities O
are O
popular O
among O
younger O
generations O
because O
of O
their O
glamorous O
lifestyles O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
following B-claim
celebrities I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
dangerous I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
youth I-claim
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
looking O
at O
how O
health O
and O
personality O
of O
young O
people O
is O
affected O
by O
following O
celebrities O
as O
their O
mentors O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
seen O
that O
following B-claim
celebrities I-claim
blindly I-claim
affects I-claim
the I-claim
health I-claim
of I-claim
adolescents I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
indulge I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
drugs I-premise
and I-premise
start I-premise
smoking I-premise
at I-premise
an I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
survey I-premise
carried I-premise
out I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
asked I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
that I-premise
why I-premise
did I-premise
they I-premise
start I-premise
smoking I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
around I-premise
forty I-premise
percent I-premise
of I-premise
individuals I-premise
answered I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
wanted I-premise
to I-premise
look I-premise
like I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
screen I-premise
actor I-premise
while I-premise
smoking I-premise
cigarettes I-premise
. O

This O
example O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
imitating B-premise
celebrities I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
negative I-premise
influence I-premise
on I-premise
health I-premise
of I-premise
young I-premise
individuals I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
when B-premise
youth I-premise
follows I-premise
celebrities I-premise
it I-premise
affects I-premise
personality I-premise
of I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
bad I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Adolescents B-premise
follow I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
the I-premise
make I-premise
up I-premise
and I-premise
attire I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
favorite I-premise
stars I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
their I-premise
behavior I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
recently B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
poll I-premise
conducted I-premise
by I-premise
an I-premise
American I-premise
magazine I-premise
it I-premise
was I-premise
found I-premise
that I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
parents I-premise
and I-premise
teachers I-premise
complain I-premise
that I-premise
teenagers I-premise
use I-premise
derogatory I-premise
words I-premise
and I-premise
abusive I-premise
language I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
and I-premise
at I-premise
schools I-premise
. O

So O
, O
this O
example O
makes O
it O
obvious O
that O
these B-claim
glamorous I-claim
celebrities I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
poor I-claim
effect I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
conduct I-claim
of I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Thus O
to O
conclude O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
when B-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
follow I-claim
celebrities I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
affects I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
behavior I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
way I-claim
. O

This B-claim
has I-claim
an I-claim
overall I-claim
effect I-claim
on I-claim
personality I-claim
and I-claim
future I-claim
of I-claim
an I-claim
individual I-claim
. O

Therefore O
it O
is O
recommended O
that O
young O
people O
should O
be O
educated O
not O
to O
follow O
these O
celebrities O
blindly O
, O
rather O
they O
should O
focus O
on O
their O
career O
so O
that O
they O
may O
hope O
for O
a O
bright O
future O
. O

The O
gender O
issue O
for O
getting O
education O
needs O
The O
gender O
issues O
have O
been O
already O
discussing O
for O
many O
years O
in O
order O
to O
give O
solutions O
for O
realising O
the O
equal O
proportion O
of O
developing O
human O
resources O
. O

Implementing O
the O
statue O
and O
right O
of O
equal O
education O
are O
believed O
as O
a O
sustainable O
policy O
that O
should O
be O
held O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
institutions I-claim
that I-claim
accept I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
average I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
male I-claim
and I-claim
female I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
many I-claim
kinds I-claim
of I-claim
course I-claim
. O

I O
strongly O
agree O
about O
this O
statement O
. O

The B-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
women I-premise
is I-premise
rising I-premise
year I-premise
by I-premise
year I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
recently I-premise
. O

Automatically O
, O
the B-claim
issue I-claim
stimulates I-claim
the I-claim
stakeholders I-claim
from I-claim
many I-claim
places I-claim
to I-claim
think I-claim
what I-claim
kind I-claim
of I-claim
preparations I-claim
they I-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
for I-claim
stabilising I-claim
the I-claim
economic I-claim
growth I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
quality I-claim
life I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
. O

We O
can O
see O
now O
that O
women B-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
fields I-premise
which I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
normally I-premise
done I-premise
by I-premise
men I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
being I-premise
engineers I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
dealing I-premise
with I-premise
machines I-premise
. O

Those O
activities O
have O
proven O
that O
women B-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
men I-premise
's I-premise
works I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
female B-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
indicated I-claim
having I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
potential I-claim
and I-claim
capability I-claim
as I-claim
men I-claim
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
order O
to O
gaining O
higher O
education O
degree O
as O
it O
is O
required O
to O
establish O
a O
person O
's O
career O
. O

These B-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
so I-premise
hard I-premise
for I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
a I-premise
proper I-premise
job I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
not I-premise
degree I-premise
certificate I-premise
from I-premise
Universities I-premise
. O

So O
, O
learning B-premise
from I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
history I-premise
, I-premise
education I-premise
provides I-premise
someone I-premise
to I-premise
widen I-premise
his I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
experience I-premise
for I-premise
facing I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
situation I-premise
of I-premise
workplace I-premise
through I-premise
subject I-premise
taught I-premise
in I-premise
college I-premise
. O

According O
to O
this O
opinion O
, O
giving B-claim
equal I-claim
education I-claim
for I-claim
both I-claim
men I-claim
and I-claim
women I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
must I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
needs I-claim
for I-claim
having I-claim
developed I-claim
- I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
gaining I-claim
degree I-claim
certificate I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
build I-claim
someone I-claim
's I-claim
career I-claim
are I-claim
totally I-claim
needed I-claim
to I-claim
implement I-claim
and I-claim
applied I-claim
for I-claim
any I-claim
gender I-claim
. O

As O
the O
world O
's O
situation O
is O
always O
changing O
, O
act B-claim
for I-claim
distributing I-claim
education I-claim
needs I-claim
are I-claim
absolutely I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
compete I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
challenges I-claim
. O

Smoking O
should O
be O
made O
prohibited O
in O
public O
places O
People O
the O
world O
over O
have O
designated O
smoothing O
as O
a O
shameful O
practice O
and O
a O
lethal O
habit O
. O

Several O
millions O
of O
smokers O
die O
suffering O
from O
cancers O
such O
as O
lung O
and O
oral O
. O

This O
bad O
habit O
also O
responsible O
for O
causing O
health O
hazards O
to O
passive O
- O
smokers O
: O
who O
are O
around O
smoking O
is O
taken O
place O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
argued O
that O
smoking B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
made I-claim
prohibited I-claim
in I-claim
public I-claim
places I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
bus I-claim
and I-claim
railway I-claim
stations I-claim
. O

This O
position O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
looking O
at O
how O
this O
arrangement O
has O
benefited O
both O
general O
public O
as O
well O
as O
smokers O
. O

To O
start O
, O
non B-claim
- I-claim
smoking I-claim
public I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
undoubtedly I-claim
benefited I-claim
by I-claim
enforcing I-claim
such I-claim
restrain I-claim
. O

Prior B-premise
to I-premise
1980 I-premise
's I-premise
public I-premise
places I-premise
in I-premise
Sri I-premise
Lanka I-premise
, I-premise
illustrates I-premise
unpleasant I-premise
situation I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
smoked I-premise
freely I-premise
. O

Even B-premise
in I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
they I-premise
engaged I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
intolerant I-premise
bad I-premise
habit I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
instances I-premise
that I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
belligerent I-premise
incidents I-premise
. O

After B-premise
enforcing I-premise
restrictions I-premise
the I-premise
situation I-premise
came I-premise
to I-premise
control I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
act I-premise
as I-premise
benefit I-premise
rendered I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
introducing B-claim
smoking I-claim
ban I-claim
in I-claim
public I-claim
places I-claim
would I-claim
greatly I-claim
discourage I-claim
people I-claim
from I-claim
engaging I-claim
tobacco I-claim
puffing I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
further B-premise
enforcement I-premise
banned I-premise
smoking I-premise
in I-premise
capital I-premise
in I-premise
Sri I-premise
Lanka I-premise
has I-premise
reduced I-premise
this I-premise
consumption I-premise
related I-premise
diseases I-premise
and I-premise
deaths I-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
per I-premise
the I-premise
ministry I-premise
of I-premise
health I-premise
. O

As O
this O
shows O
, O
smoking B-premise
restrictions I-premise
has I-premise
successfully I-premise
daunted I-premise
public I-premise
from I-premise
this I-premise
bad I-premise
puffing I-premise
that I-premise
put I-premise
less I-premise
strain I-premise
on I-premise
country I-premise
's I-premise
healthcare I-premise
systems I-premise
. O

After O
analyzing O
smoke O
illegalization O
in O
public O
places O
in O
Sri O
Lanka O
, O
it B-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
proven I-claim
benefits I-claim
people I-claim
enjoy I-claim
this I-claim
arrangement I-claim
. O

It O
is O
thus O
hoped O
governments O
would O
consider O
smoke O
banning O
in O
public O
places O
following O
footsteps O
of O
Sri O
Lanka O
as O
well O
as O
many O
other O
countries O
. O

Tourism O
: O
good O
or O
bad O
? O

Tourism O
, O
since O
its O
first O
appearance O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
can O
be O
described O
as O
a O
controversial O
celebrity O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
tourism O
is O
attributed O
to O
domestic O
economic O
distortion O
, O
environmental O
devastation O
and O
irrepairable O
damage O
to O
the O
exploited O
places O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
disagree O
with O
this O
misconcept O
for O
the O
two O
following O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
tourism B-claim
plays I-claim
an I-claim
indispensable I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
nurturing I-claim
the I-claim
economy I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
way I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
meant I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
. O

Basically O
, O
places B-premise
of I-premise
interest I-premise
often I-premise
locate I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
wilderness I-premise
areas I-premise
, I-premise
of I-premise
which I-premise
economy I-premise
, I-premise
before I-premise
their I-premise
appearance I-premise
, I-premise
have I-premise
n't I-premise
blossmed I-premise
yet I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
until I-premise
the I-premise
investment I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
companies I-premise
do I-premise
chains I-premise
of I-premise
hotels I-premise
and I-premise
services I-premise
spring I-premise
up I-premise
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
all I-premise
means I-premise
, I-premise
attract I-premise
considerable I-premise
attention I-premise
which I-premise
goes I-premise
hand I-premise
in I-premise
hand I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
enormous I-premise
income I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
residents I-premise
. O

In O
other O
word O
, O
tourism B-premise
helps I-premise
divert I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
economy I-premise
to I-premise
its I-premise
right I-premise
direction I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
exploit I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
its I-premise
own I-premise
potential I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
even O
though O
environmental B-premise
damage I-premise
is I-premise
inevitable I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
tourism I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
blamed I-premise
for I-premise
. O

In B-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
turn I-premise
a I-premise
wilderness I-premise
into I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
of I-premise
attraction I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
planners I-premise
must I-premise
have I-premise
taken I-premise
the I-premise
nourishment I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
sceneries I-premise
into I-premise
thorough I-premise
consideration I-premise
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
fortune I-premise
is I-premise
spent I-premise
on I-premise
trimming I-premise
the I-premise
trees I-premise
, I-premise
watering I-premise
the I-premise
flowers I-premise
, I-premise
preserving I-premise
and I-premise
balancing I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
fauna I-premise
and I-premise
flora I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
hope I-premise
of I-premise
beautifying I-premise
the I-premise
wild I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
to I-premise
mention I-premise
ecotourism I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
environment I-premise
- I-premise
friendly I-premise
service I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
gives I-premise
all I-premise
environmentalists I-premise
and I-premise
nature I-premise
lovers I-premise
a I-premise
hand I-premise
in I-premise
raising I-premise
the I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
protecting I-premise
their I-premise
coexistent I-premise
creatures I-premise
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
tourism B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
alledged I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
notorous I-claim
for I-claim
its I-claim
detriment I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
ecological I-claim
diversity I-claim
. O

All O
thing O
considered O
, O
tourism B-claim
has I-claim
proven I-claim
its I-claim
friendly I-claim
attitude I-claim
towards I-claim
the I-claim
exploited I-claim
areas I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
finance I-claim
and I-claim
environmental I-claim
impact I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the B-claim
combination I-claim
of I-claim
tourism I-claim
and I-claim
teaching I-claim
process I-claim
is I-claim
highly I-claim
recommended I-claim
in I-claim
pursuit I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
harmonial I-claim
relationship I-claim
between I-claim
human I-claim
and I-claim
their I-claim

Future O
information O

positive O
or O
negative O
? O

The O
appearance O
of O

( O
IT O

in O
the O
last O
20 O
years O
has O
brought O
about O

However O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
evolution O
also O
proves O
to O
be O
detrimental O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
is O
a O
likelihood O
that O
future B-claim
developments I-claim
in I-claim
IT I-claim
will I-claim
put I-claim
the I-claim
users I-claim
at I-claim

With O
the O

IT B-claim

Vegetarianism O
- O
why O
some O
people O
are O
choosing O
to O
become O
vegetarian O
? O

Since O
the O
dawn O
of O
time O
, O
human O
has O
considered O
meat O
as O
a O
fundamental O
protein O
sources O
. O

Meat O
has O
served O
as O
the O
main O
dish O
in O
almost O
every O
family O
's O
meals O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Recent O
years O
, O
however O
, O
has O
seen O
a O
rapid O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
vegetarians O
. O

Some O
people O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
care O
for O
animal O
rights O
issue O
, O
others O
think O
it O
is O
much O
beyond O
that O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
people B-claim
avoid I-claim
eating I-claim
meat I-claim
mostly I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
sake I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
and I-claim
relegious I-claim
aspect I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
health B-claim
improvement I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
main I-claim
reason I-claim
for I-claim
vegetarian I-claim
diet I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
so I-claim
popular I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
researchers I-premise
have I-premise
convinced I-premise
that I-premise
many I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
vegetable I-premise
contain I-premise
antioxydant I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
prevent I-premise
cancer I-premise
. O

This O
fortifies O
the O
fact O
that O
a B-premise
vegetable I-premise
diet I-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
good I-premise
for I-premise
our I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Although O
some O
argue O
that O
a B-premise
meal I-premise
without I-premise
meat I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
protein I-premise
intake I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
proved I-premise
that I-premise
many I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
bean I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
soy I-premise
bean I-premise
or I-premise
pea I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
comparable I-premise
protein I-premise
sources I-premise
. O

Secondy O
, O
relegious O
beliefs O
also O
contributes O
to O
a O
vegetarian O
diet O
. O

Some B-premise
religion I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Buddha I-premise
, I-premise
believes I-premise
that I-premise
animals I-premise
were I-premise
human I-premise
being I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
previous I-premise
life I-premise
, O
so O
eating B-premise
their I-premise
meat I-premise

mean I-premise
you I-premise
eat I-premise
the I-premise
flesh I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise
parent I-premise
sentient I-premise
beings I-premise
. O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
this O
view O
is O
rather O
unscientific O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
vital I-claim
to I-claim
follow I-claim
one I-claim
's I-claim
own I-claim
religious I-claim
practices I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
the I-claim
enlightenment I-claim
in I-claim
mind I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
is O
evident O
for O
me O
that O
people B-claim
choose I-claim
to I-claim
become I-claim
vegetarians I-claim
for I-claim
health I-claim
and I-claim
religious I-claim
concern I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
benefits I-claim
of I-claim
animals I-claim
. O

However O
, O
a O
meal O
which O
is O
nutritionally O
balanced O
is O
always O
most O
recommended O
. O

The O
maintenance O
of O
traditional O
skills O
and O
ways O
of O
life O
? O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O

the O
application O
of O
technological O
developments O
in O
some O
countries O
will O
be O
accompanied O
with O
modern O
skills O
and O
new O
lifestyles O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
these O
so O
- O
called O
cultural O
invasions O
will O
result O
in O
the O
distinction O
of O
national O
traditions O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
maintain O
them O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
what B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
expected I-claim
, I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
change I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
role I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
tradition I-claim
but I-claim
not I-claim
its I-claim
disappearance I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the B-claim
country I-claim
's I-claim
culture I-claim
is I-claim
passed I-claim
down I-claim
mainly I-claim
through I-claim
traditional I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
ways I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
Vietnam I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
water I-premise
puppet I-premise
shows I-premise
which I-premise
once I-premise
demonstrated I-premise
our I-premise
seasonal I-premise
agriculture I-premise
and I-premise
communal I-premise
activities I-premise
, I-premise
are I-premise
today I-premise
substituted I-premise
by I-premise
cinemas I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
concerts I-premise
. O

This O
means O
the B-premise
young I-premise
generation I-premise
can I-premise
solely I-premise
get I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
ancestor I-premise
's I-premise
early I-premise
life I-premise
through I-premise
books I-premise
and I-premise
images I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
otherwise I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
easily I-premise
absorbed I-premise
. O

In O
tradition O
, O
a B-claim
person I-claim
should I-claim
look I-claim
back I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
, I-claim
mainly I-claim
by I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
custom I-claim
handcraft I-claim
or I-claim
antique I-claim
lifestyle I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
progress I-claim
. O

Understanding B-premise
why I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
how I-premise
our I-premise
predecessors I-premise
survived I-premise
through I-premise
thick I-premise
and I-premise
thin I-premise
will I-premise
probably I-premise
be I-premise
invaluable I-premise
lessons I-premise
for I-premise
us I-premise
today I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
study B-premise
form I-premise
their I-premise
mistakes I-premise
helps I-premise
us I-premise
accomplish I-premise
our I-premise
goal I-premise
with I-premise
smooth I-premise
sailing I-premise
. O

To O
sumarize O
, O
there B-claim
should I-claim
never I-claim
be I-claim
any I-claim
replacement I-claim
for I-claim
traditional I-claim
skills I-claim
or I-claim
ways I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
. O

They B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
ones I-claim
that I-claim
teach I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
will I-claim
teach I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
self I-claim
- I-claim
esteem I-claim
and I-claim
experienced I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
means I-claim
their I-claim
preservation I-claim
throughout I-claim
history I-claim
deserve I-claim
our I-claim
attention I-claim
. O

The O
zoo O
deserves O
maintenance O
and O
public O
respect O
For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
zoo O
has O
been O
a O
second O
home O
to O
endangered O
animals O
. O

However O
, O
other O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
existence O
of O
zoos O
is O
next O
to O
nothing O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
deserves I-claim
maintenance I-claim
and I-claim
public I-claim
respect I-claim
for O
two O
specific O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
considered I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
education I-claim
with I-claim
regard I-claim
to I-claim
providing I-claim
real I-claim
and I-claim
vivid I-claim
materials I-claim
for I-claim
learners I-claim
. O

With B-premise
zoos I-premise
, I-premise
pupils I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
observing I-premise
the I-premise
habit I-premise
and I-premise
unique I-premise
instinct I-premise
of I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
lion I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
crocodile I-premise
. O

At O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
of I-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
benefits I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
biological I-premise
research I-premise
based I-premise
on I-premise
practical I-premise
statistics I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
recordings I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
otherwise I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
at I-premise
hand I-premise
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
zoos B-premise
conduce I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
acquisition I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
at I-premise
various I-premise
levels I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
also I-claim
serve I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
ecological I-claim
protection I-claim
. O

Nowadays B-premise
the I-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
globalisation I-premise
is I-premise
accompanied I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
encroachment I-premise
upon I-premise
natural I-premise
habitats I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
consequently I-premise
calls I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
help I-premise
of I-premise
zoos I-premise
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
the B-premise
ever I-premise
- I-premise
increasing I-premise
huntings I-premise
are I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
heavy I-premise
toll I-premise
on I-premise
rare I-premise
and I-premise
specious I-premise
species I-premise
. O

Only B-premise
when I-premise
zoos I-premise
appear I-premise
are I-premise
such I-premise
distinction I-premise
- I-premise
driven I-premise
animals I-premise
as I-premise
: I-premise
giraffe I-premise
, I-premise
panda I-premise
, I-premise
koala I-premise
or I-premise
leopard I-premise
provided I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
inaccessible I-premise
territory I-premise
. O

In O
sum O
, O
the B-claim
role I-claim
of I-claim
zoos I-claim
towards I-claim
both I-claim
human I-claim
and I-claim
animals I-claim
is I-claim
undeniably I-claim
indispensable I-claim
. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended O
that O
zoos O
should O
be O
seen O
with O
different O
perspective O
in O
order O
to O
function O
at O
their O
most O
efficiency O
. O

Languages O
' O
extinction O
, O
discuss O
both O
views O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
increasing O
number O
of O
languages O
which O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
extinction O
has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
issues O
that O
many O
people O
of O
today O
's O
society O
are O
very O
concerned O
for O
. O

The O
question O
whether O
our O
government O
should O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
preserve O
them O
by O
investing O
more O
money O
on O
that O
minority O
languages O
or O
not O
is O
still O
a O
debatable O
one O
. O

I O
personally O
suppose O
that O
no B-claim
matter I-claim
how I-claim
widely I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
spoken I-claim
, I-claim
every I-claim
language I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
protected I-claim
from I-claim
being I-claim
disappeared I-claim
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
saving B-claim
regional I-claim
languages I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
seen I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
we B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
that I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
expands I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
scope I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
languages I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
really I-premise
expensive I-premise
because O
educational B-premise
programmes I-premise
will I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
given I-premise
so I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
learning I-premise
and I-premise
using I-premise
them I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
some B-premise
certain I-premise
areas I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
Southern I-premise
Vietnam I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
trying I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
their I-premise
secondary I-premise
school I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
originally I-premise
from I-premise
khmer I-premise
people I-premise
speak I-premise
their I-premise
language I-premise
beside I-premise
Vietnamese I-premise
, O
so O
the B-premise
local I-premise
government I-premise
has I-premise
recently I-premise
struggled I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
costly I-premise
investments I-premise
on I-premise
language I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
appropriate I-premise
materials I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
in B-claim
many I-claim
aspects I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
communication I-claim
, I-claim
trade I-claim
, I-claim
cooperation I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
transaction I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
absolutely I-claim
easier I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
whole I-claim
society I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
together I-claim
in I-claim
one I-claim
language I-claim
only I-claim
. O

Despite O
of O
the O
above O
arguments O
, O
i O
still O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
try I-claim
to I-claim
preserve I-claim
minority I-claim
languages I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
language B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
as I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
just I-premise
one I-premise
method I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
forming B-premise
a I-premise
language I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
undergone I-premise
thousands I-premise
of I-premise
years I-premise
; O
thus O
, O
it B-premise
deserves I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
respected I-premise
and I-premise
preserved I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
language B-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
essential I-premise
factors I-premise
creating I-premise
the I-premise
differences I-premise
and I-premise
unique I-premise
cutures I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
saving B-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
languages I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
generally I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
element I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
cultural I-premise
diversity I-premise
's I-premise
preservation I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
letting B-claim
languages I-claim
spoken I-claim
by I-claim
ethnic I-claim
minorities I-claim
be I-claim
extinct I-claim
seems I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
very I-claim
beneficial I-claim
, O
it B-claim
will I-claim
definitely I-claim
impact I-claim
seriously I-claim
on I-claim
many I-claim
other I-claim
aspects I-claim
especially I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
loss I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
cultural I-claim
heritages I-claim
. O

: O

" O
Prevention O
is O

" O
. O

This O
statement O
has O
raised O
a O
question O
whether O
the O
government O
should O
allocate O
a O
large O
sum O
out O
of O
the O
national O
health O
budget O
to O
educating O
and O

. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this B-claim
plan I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
put I-claim
into I-claim
practice I-claim
for O
the O
two O
reasons O
mentioned O
accordingly O
. O

No B-claim
one I-claim
can I-claim
argue I-claim
the I-claim
importance I-claim
to I-claim
include I-claim
health I-claim
lessons I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
programmes I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
at I-claim
primary I-claim
level I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
hope I-claim
of I-claim
raising I-claim
people I-claim

awareness I-claim
. O

Children B-premise

nutritious I-premise
food I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
harmful I-premise
ones I-premise
, O
thereby O
they B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
fundamental I-premise
grasp I-premise
of I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise

it O

there B-claim

In O
conclusion O

both I-claim

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-premise

yield I-premise
more I-premise

That O

why O
it B-claim

Teacher O

Recently O

there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
with O
regard O
to O
who O
is O
the O
best O
teacher O
for O
children O
's O
education O
. O

Indeed O
, O
children O
grow O
up O
with O
two O
important O
people O
, O
their O
parents O
and O
teachers O
, O
and O
both O
are O
important O
in O
children O
's O
development O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the B-claim
teacher I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
option I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
education I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
aspects I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
school B-claim
teachers I-claim
are I-claim
more I-claim
qualified I-claim
than I-claim
parents I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
field I-claim
of I-claim
education I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
to B-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
obtain I-premise
the I-premise
teacher I-premise
certificates I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
need I-premise
years I-premise
of I-premise
training I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
normal I-premise
schools I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
theoretical I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

However O
, O
in B-premise
comparison I-premise
to I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
parents I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
less I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
subjects I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
mathematics I-premise
and I-premise
physics I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
teaching B-claim
staff I-claim
are I-claim
professional I-claim
and I-claim
experienced I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
promoting I-claim
children I-claim

communication I-claim
skills I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
after B-premise
many I-premise
years I-premise
of I-premise
teaching I-premise
experience I-premise
, I-premise
teacher I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
important I-premise
life I-premise
skills I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
learning I-premise
personal I-premise
boundaries I-premise
, I-premise
facing I-premise
future I-premise
problems I-premise
and I-premise
learning I-premise
important I-premise
conflict I-premise
resolution I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
parents B-premise
are I-premise
facing I-premise
difficult I-premise
generation I-premise
gap I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
because I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
less I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
handle I-premise
family I-premise
conflicts I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
efficient I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
compared B-premise
with I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
parents I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
enough I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Nowadays B-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
facing I-premise
a I-premise
global I-premise
economic I-premise
crisis I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
both I-premise
parents I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
, O
hence O
there B-premise
is I-premise
only I-premise
limited I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it B-claim
was I-claim
impossible I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
teacher I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
teachers B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
education I-claim
. O

Not B-claim
only I-claim
do I-claim
they I-claim
contribute I-claim
much I-claim
to I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
professional I-claim
skills I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
teach I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
important I-claim
social I-claim
communication I-claim
techniques I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim

I O
personally O

that O
there B-claim

many I-claim
other I-claim

In O
the O

some O
of O
my O

On O
one O
hand O

i O
agree O
that O
money B-premise
is I-premise
very I-premise
essential I-premise
in I-premise

human I-premise
' I-premise
basic I-premise

. O

More O
specifically O
, O
people B-claim
tend I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
high I-claim
salary I-claim
jobs I-claim
so I-claim
as I-claim
to I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
help I-claim
themselves I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
support I-claim
partially I-claim
or I-claim
wholly I-claim
their I-claim
family I-claim

living I-claim
needs I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
people B-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
woking I-premise
in I-premise
art I-premise
or I-premise
painting I-premise
industries I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise

will I-premise
find I-premise
it I-premise
quite I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
comfortably I-premise

enjoyably I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
doing I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
love I-premise

their I-premise
income I-premise
however I-premise
seems I-premise

other I-premise

On O
the O
other O

i O
believe O
that O
if B-claim
we I-claim
are I-claim
passionate I-claim
about I-claim
what I-claim
we I-claim
are I-claim
working I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
are I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
success I-claim
easily I-claim
in I-claim
that I-claim
field I-claim
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise

who I-premise
are I-premise
now I-premise
really I-premise
successful I-premise

have I-premise
started I-premise

Besides O
, O
important B-premise
factors I-premise
in I-premise
choosing I-premise
a I-premise

managers I-premise

should I-premise
not I-premise

underestimated I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
choose I-premise
a I-premise
career I-premise
due I-premise

their I-premise
desire I-premise

contribute I-premise
positively I-premise

their I-premise
countries I-premise

. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
income B-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
a I-claim
vital I-claim
determination I-claim
impacting I-claim

Nonetheless O

in I-claim
my I-claim
opinion I-claim

can I-claim
bring I-claim
actual I-claim
happiness I-claim

Increased O

There O

no O
doubt O

our O
life O

had O
a O
change O

However O

cars O
themselves O

have O
exerted O
severe O
pressure O
on O
the O
environment O

for O
wasteful O
oil O

. O

While B-claim
many I-claim
believe I-claim
that I-claim
petrol I-claim
and I-claim
diesel I-claim
fuel I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
charged I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
highest I-claim
taxation I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
strongly I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
this I-claim
notion I-claim
. O

One O
can O
not O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
if B-premise
petrol I-premise
and I-premise
fuel I-premise
taxation I-premise
are I-premise
raised I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
might I-premise
hesitate I-premise
choosing I-premise
a I-premise
personal I-premise
automobile I-premise
. O

Taxation B-claim
may I-claim
have I-claim
tackled I-claim
the I-claim
environmental I-claim
issue I-claim
simply I-claim
by I-claim
diverting I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
public I-claim
transportations I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
trains I-claim
, I-claim
buses I-claim
or I-claim
ferries I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
for B-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
already I-premise
afforded I-premise
a I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
likelihood I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
restraint I-premise
from I-premise
usage I-premise
on I-premise
long I-premise
journeys I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
crowded I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

However O
, O
taxation B-premise
on I-premise
flamable I-premise
resources I-premise
might I-premise
backfire I-premise
by I-premise
conducing I-premise
to I-premise
inflation I-premise
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
the B-premise
more I-premise
costly I-premise
petrol I-premise
is I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
higher I-premise
the I-premise
price I-premise
of I-premise
necessary I-premise
product I-premise
: I-premise
rice I-premise
, I-premise
meat I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise

. O

Consequently O
, O
people B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
turn I-claim
to I-claim
cheaper I-claim
alternatives I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
might I-claim
cause I-claim
the I-claim
abundance I-claim
in I-claim
goods I-claim
and I-claim
later I-claim
on I-claim
, I-claim
economic I-claim
crisis I-claim
. O

Another O
point O
that O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
is O
countries B-claim
that I-claim
import I-claim
oil I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
dependent I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
exporters I-claim
, I-claim
both I-claim
politically I-claim
and I-claim
financially I-claim
. O

Suppose B-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
those I-premise
countries I-premise
cut I-premise
down I-premise
on I-premise
its I-premise
oil I-premise
support I-premise
, I-premise
other I-premise
nations I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
more I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
release I-premise
beneficial I-premise
policies I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

America B-premise

for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
has I-premise
recently I-premise
drawn I-premise
its I-premise
intervention I-premise
in I-premise
Russian I-premise

only I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise

To O
summarize O
, O
higher B-claim

its I-claim
own I-claim
pros I-claim

it B-claim

that O
many O
people O
of O
today O
's O
society O
are O
very O
concerned O
for O
. O

Few O
individuals O
assume O
that O
this B-claim
trend I-claim
reflects I-claim
and I-claim
enhances I-claim
the I-claim
high I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
in I-claim
society I-claim
. O

I O
totally O
agree O
with O
this O
viewpoint O
for O
some O
specific O
reasons O
which O
would O
be O
given O
and O
analyzed O
in O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
we B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
that I-premise
police I-premise
armed I-premise
with I-premise
guns I-premise
or I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
legal I-premise
weapons I-premise
just I-premise
attempts I-premise
to I-premise
protect I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
civilians I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
criminals B-premise
todays I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
sophisticated I-premise
so I-premise
they I-premise
spend I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
modern I-premise
weapons I-premise
to I-premise
cope I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
police I-premise
and I-premise
serve I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
nefarious I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
citizens B-premise
in I-premise
that I-premise
society I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
shot I-premise
by I-premise
both I-premise
police I-premise
and I-premise
offenders I-premise
accidentally I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
while B-premise
on I-premise
duty I-premise
, I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
are I-premise
private I-premise
citizens I-premise
affected I-premise
but I-premise
facilities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
cars I-premise
, I-premise
houses I-premise
, I-premise
streets I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
destroyed I-premise
by I-premise
guns I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
a B-claim
society I-claim
that I-claim
its I-claim
police I-claim
force I-claim
carries I-claim
guns I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
definitely I-claim
seen I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
highly I-claim
violent I-claim
one I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
police B-premise
force I-premise
carries I-premise
guns I-premise
only I-premise
in I-premise
high I-premise
crime I-premise
societies I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
people B-premise
and I-premise
police I-premise
in I-premise
those I-premise
ones I-premise
usually I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
dangerous I-premise
diverse I-premise
crime I-premise
's I-premise
categories I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
theft I-premise
, I-premise
robbery I-premise
, I-premise
murder I-premise
, I-premise
rape I-premise
, I-premise
vandalism I-premise
, I-premise
arson I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
Those B-claim
are I-claim
possibly I-claim
the I-claim
strongest I-claim
evidences I-claim
to I-claim
determine I-claim
a I-claim
society I-claim
suffering I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
from O
the O
above O
views O
, O
although O
being B-claim
armed I-claim
with I-claim
guns I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
police I-claim
force I-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
, O
it B-claim
will I-claim
bring I-claim
the I-claim
higher I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
government O
should O
to O
impose O
strict O
laws O
in O
carrying O
weapons O
as O
well O
as O
give O
professional O
training O
to O
them O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
any O
influence O
on O
civilians O
' O
lives O
. O

Negative O
effects O
of O
technological O
process O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
technological O
process O
has O
brought O
numerous O
benefits O
making O
human O
life O
become O
more O
and O
more O
comfortable O
and O
easy O
. O

Some O
individuals O
assume O
that O
this O
technological O
development O
also O
causes O
many O
drawbacks O
impacting O
seriously O
on O
our O
lives O
. O

I O
personally O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

In O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
, O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
above O
matter O
as O
well O
as O
my O
own O
view O
's O
explanations O
would O
be O
analyzed O
and O
given O
, O
respectively O
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
that O
thanks B-claim
to I-claim
modern I-claim
technology I-claim
invented I-claim
recently I-claim
, I-claim
human I-claim
life I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
improved I-claim
dramatically I-claim
. O

Air B-premise
- I-premise
conditioners I-premise
, I-premise
computers I-premise
, I-premise
cellphones I-premise
, I-premise
washing I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
as I-premise
greatest I-premise
inventions I-premise
helping I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
stress I-premise
and I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
other I-premise
activities I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
applying B-premise
technological I-premise
science I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
preparation I-premise
of I-premise
medications I-premise
also I-premise
plays I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
saving I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
' I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

However O
, O
some O
negative O
aspects O
of O
technological O
process O
need O
to O
be O
mentioned O
clearly O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
bring O
fantastic O
advantages O
, O
technological B-claim
products I-claim
have I-claim
devastated I-claim
the I-claim
natural I-claim
environment I-claim
indirectly I-claim
through I-claim
its I-claim
production I-claim
process I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
exploiting B-premise
and I-premise
collecting I-premise
raw I-premise
materials I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
essential I-premise
fuels I-premise
to I-premise
serve I-premise
the I-premise
production I-premise
of I-premise
technological I-premise
products I-premise
have I-premise
destroyed I-premise
nature I-premise
seriously I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
decrease I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
deal I-claim
of I-claim
creativity I-claim
in I-claim
certain I-claim
groups I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
especially I-claim
children I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
youth I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
dependence I-claim
upon I-claim
available I-claim
achievements I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
totally O
believe O
that O
technology B-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
contribution I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
and I-claim
civilization I-claim
. O

We B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
neglect I-claim
profound I-claim
impact I-claim
of I-claim
great I-claim
technological I-claim
process I-claim
on I-claim
human I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
its O
adverse O
effects O
need O
controlling O
more O
reasonably O
. O

Large O
amount O
of O
violence O
in O
television O
programs O
Excessive O
violence O
in O
television O
programs O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
major O
concerns O
facing O
society O
. O

Reducing O
such O
contents O
from O
TV O
shows O
is O
the O
widely O
accepted O
solution O
endorsed O
by O
the O
majority O
of O
governments O
throughout O
the O
world O
today O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
definitely I-claim
reduce I-claim
violent I-claim
components I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
minimum I-claim
in I-claim
kidvids I-claim
, I-claim
while I-claim
such I-claim
contents I-claim
remain I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
TV I-claim
shows I-claim
that I-claim
for I-claim
mature I-claim
minds I-claim
to I-claim
watch I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
entirely I-claim
reasonable I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
reducing B-premise
the I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
violent I-premise
content I-premise
in I-premise
TV I-premise
shows I-premise
could I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
degree I-premise
, I-premise
decrease I-premise
the I-premise
overall I-premise
crime I-premise
rate I-premise
. O

However O
, O
in O
order O
to O
tackle O
this O
problem O
more O
effectively O
, O
governments B-premise
must I-premise
first I-premise
prohibit I-premise
any I-premise
types I-premise
of I-premise
violent I-premise
content I-premise
in I-premise
all I-premise
children I-premise
’s I-premise
television I-premise
programs I-premise
. O

As B-premise
a I-premise
result I-premise
of I-premise
mental I-premise
immaturity I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
youngsters I-premise
are I-premise
incapable I-premise
of I-premise
distinguishing I-premise
right I-premise
from I-premise
wrong I-premise
. O

Little O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
by B-premise
watching I-premise
these I-premise
violent I-premise
TV I-premise
programs I-premise
and I-premise
videos I-premise
, I-premise
juveniles I-premise
will I-premise
become I-premise
very I-premise
aggressive I-premise
and I-premise
offensive I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
tendency I-premise
to I-premise
commit I-premise
crimes I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
rather I-claim
necessary I-claim
for I-claim
governments I-claim
to I-claim
establish I-claim
an I-claim
intensive I-claim
law I-claim
that I-claim
prevents I-claim
teenagers I-claim
from I-claim
watching I-claim
these I-claim
violent I-claim
and I-claim
brutal I-claim
TV I-claim
Shows I-claim
and I-claim
movies I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
certainly I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
violation I-claim
of I-claim
adults I-claim
’ I-claim
civil I-claim
liberties I-claim
, I-claim
if I-claim
governments I-claim
implement I-claim
such I-claim
a I-claim
restricted I-claim
regulation I-claim
on I-claim
these I-claim
TV I-claim
shows I-claim
or I-claim
movies I-claim
that I-claim
only I-claim
for I-claim
mature I-claim
audiences I-claim
. O

Frequently O
, O
adults B-premise
watch I-premise
horror I-premise
video I-premise
or I-premise
war I-premise
movies I-premise
for I-premise
relaxing I-premise
themselves I-premise
after I-premise
a I-premise
busy I-premise
day I-premise
. O

For B-premise
whom I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
media I-premise
sources I-premise
are I-premise
mere I-premise
materials I-premise
of I-premise
relaxation I-premise
and I-premise
entertainment I-premise
. O

Considering B-premise
that I-premise
these I-premise
mature I-premise
minds I-premise
are I-premise
capable I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
responsible I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
behaviors I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
certainly I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
to I-premise
watch I-premise
TV I-premise
shows I-premise
or I-premise
movies I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
appealing I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
violent B-claim
contents I-claim
must I-claim
be I-claim
excluded I-claim
from I-claim
all I-claim
kidvids I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
proportion I-claim
of I-claim
juvenile I-claim
delinquency I-claim
; O
however O
, O
the O
adults O
should O
not O
be O
the O
victim O
of O
this O
policy O
. O

Do O
guns O
can O
really O
increase O
the O
level O
of O
violence O
? O

The O
number O
of O
criminality O
is O
increase O
rapidly O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O

Some O
inhabitants O
argue O
that O
this O
case O
appears O
because O
the O
guns O
are O
always O
used O
by O
a O
police O
to O
solve O
a O
criminal O
act O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
disagree O
with O
this O
statement O
, O
while O
I O
believe O
that O
other O
factors O
contribute O
a O
slight O
incline O
level O
of O
violence O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
a B-premise
police I-premise
holds I-premise
a I-premise
responsibility I-premise
to I-premise
tackle I-premise
of I-premise
violence I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
urban I-premise
or I-premise
suburban I-premise
areas I-premise
using I-premise
a I-premise
gun I-premise
. O

An B-premise
obvious I-premise
example I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
happens I-premise
in I-premise
The I-premise
United I-premise
State I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
man I-premise
killed I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
ten I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
cinema I-premise
using I-premise
a I-premise
weapon I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
a I-premise
police I-premise
shot I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
foot I-premise
to I-premise
paralyze I-premise
him I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
police B-premise
officers I-premise
can I-premise
force I-premise
a I-premise
criminal I-premise
to I-premise
surrender I-premise
, O
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
weapon I-premise
which I-premise
will I-premise
prevent I-premise
an I-premise
escaping I-premise
criminal I-premise
who I-premise
poses I-premise
a I-premise
serious I-premise
danger I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some B-claim
military I-claim
weapons I-claim
need I-claim
encouraging I-claim
for I-claim
police I-claim
officers I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
and I-claim
minimize I-claim
the I-claim
rate I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
some I-claim
reason I-claim
why I-claim
the I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
bloody I-claim
increases I-claim
significantly I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
communities I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
unemployment I-premise
rate I-premise
has I-premise
risen I-premise
to I-premise
15 I-premise
percent I-premise
in I-premise
several I-premise
globalized I-premise
and I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
globalized I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
qualified I-premise
and I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
educated I-premise
person I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
earn I-premise
some I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
comfortably I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
cost B-premise
of I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
big I-premise
city I-premise
is I-premise
extremely I-premise
expensive I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
this I-premise
problem I-premise
impresses I-premise
some I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
under I-premise
the I-premise
poverty I-premise
line I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
anything I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
their I-premise
basic I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
baggers I-premise
chose I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
pickpocket I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
transport I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the B-claim
guns I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
used I-claim
by I-claim
police I-claim
have I-claim
not I-claim
been I-claim
a I-claim
trigger I-claim
of I-claim
higher I-claim
level I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

However O
, O
some O
cases O
occupy O
a O
crucial O
reason O
to O
do O
a O
criminality O
in O
society O
such O
unemployment O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
is O
decreasing O
a O
level O
of O
unemployment O
to O
avoid O
a O
criminal O
act O
. O

Life O
in O
Big O
Cities O

People O

health O
Today O
, O
more O
and O
more O
people O
are O
moving O
to O
big O
cities O
to O
live O
. O

However O
, O
while O
life B-claim
in I-claim
those I-claim
cities I-claim
is I-claim
good I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
ways I-claim
, O
I O
completely O
argue O
that O
people B-claim
's I-claim
health I-claim
would I-claim
therefore I-claim
be I-claim
affected I-claim
negatively I-claim
. O

Environment B-claim
pollution I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
primary I-claim
reasons I-claim
why I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
cities I-claim
is I-claim
becoming I-claim
worse I-claim
than I-claim
ever I-claim
before I-claim
. O

Exhaust B-premise
from I-premise
transportation I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
cars I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
factories I-premise
' I-premise
tosix I-premise
fumes I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
with I-premise
various I-premise
respiratory I-premise
deseases I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
water B-premise
pollution I-premise
makes I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
critical I-premise
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
dangerous B-premise
bacterias I-premise
and I-premise
germs I-premise
in I-premise
polluted I-premise
water I-premise
can I-premise
go I-premise
indirectly I-premise
into I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
bodies I-premise
and I-premise
create I-premise
severe I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
may I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
death I-premise
if I-premise
the I-premise
patients I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
treated I-premise
in I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
likely I-claim
that I-claim
many I-claim
foods I-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
safe I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
eat I-claim
or I-claim
drink I-claim
. O

Recent B-premise
investigations I-premise
reveal I-premise
that I-premise
toxic I-premise
foods I-premise
are I-premise
sold I-premise
pervasively I-premise
in I-premise
today I-premise
's I-premise
market I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
overpopulation B-premise
may I-premise
make I-premise
people I-premise
suffer I-premise
from I-premise
infectious I-premise
deseases I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
cough I-premise
, I-premise
sneezing I-premise
and I-premise
illness I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
living B-claim
in I-claim
such I-claim
cities I-claim
also I-claim
means I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
high I-claim
crime I-claim
rate I-claim
areas I-claim
. O

Unemployed B-premise
workers I-premise
or I-premise
school I-premise
dropouts I-premise
can I-premise
easily I-premise
commit I-premise
crime I-premise
from I-premise
petty I-premise
offence I-premise
to I-premise
felony I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
burglary I-premise
, I-premise
pickpocketing I-premise
, I-premise
trickery I-premise
, I-premise
vandalism I-premise
, I-premise
smuggling I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
murder I-premise
. O

Earning B-claim
money I-claim
for I-claim
living I-claim
becomes I-claim
more I-claim
difficult I-claim
, I-claim
living I-claim
healthy I-claim
in I-claim
such I-claim
places I-claim
is I-claim
getting I-claim
harder I-claim
also I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
life B-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
negative I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
health I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
both O
government O
and O
individual O
should O
take O
steps O
to O
diminish O
the O
consequences O
involved O
. O

Gun O
control O
and O
increasing O
violence O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
allowing O
policemen O
to O
carries O
firearms O
can O
increase O
violence O
in O
the O
society O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
this O
assertion O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
criminal B-claim
minds I-claim
that I-claim
breed I-claim
violence I-claim
not I-claim
stringent I-claim
gun I-claim
control I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
true O
that O
if B-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
gun I-claim
control I-claim
somehow I-claim
crime I-claim
has I-claim
to I-claim
decrease I-claim
because O
fewer B-premise
guns I-premise
available I-premise
mean I-premise
less I-premise
crime I-premise
. O

However O
, O
this B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
as I-premise
simple I-premise
as I-premise
it I-premise
sounds I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
stringent B-claim
gun I-claim
control I-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
decrease I-claim
violence I-claim
and I-claim
crime I-claim
because O
most B-premise
gun I-premise
violence I-premise
is I-premise
committed I-premise
with I-premise
guns I-premise
obtained I-premise
illegally I-premise
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
intent I-premise
to I-premise
commit I-premise
crime I-premise
and I-premise
control I-premise
cities I-premise
through I-premise
gang I-premise
violence I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
means I-premise
will I-premise
find I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
continue I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
guns I-premise
, I-premise
regardless I-premise
of I-premise
gun I-premise
control I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
there B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
law I-premise
non I-premise
- I-premise
abiding I-premise
people I-premise
anywhere I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
either I-premise
polices I-premise
or I-premise
common I-premise
citizens I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the B-premise
root I-premise
of I-premise
violence I-premise
is I-premise
criminal I-premise
mind I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
weapon I-premise
itself I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
if B-claim
a I-claim
government I-claim
wants I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
crime I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
community I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
manage I-claim
their I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
actions I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
gun I-claim
used I-claim
in I-claim
violent I-claim
crimes I-claim
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
there B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
poor I-claim
relationship I-claim
between I-claim
polices I-claim
carrying I-claim
guns I-claim
and I-claim
an I-claim
increasing I-claim
violence I-claim
rate I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
criminal B-claim
mind I-claim
seems I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
related I-claim
to I-claim
violence I-claim
. O

Consequently O
, O
we O
should O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
adjust O
people O
's O
behaviors O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
crimes O
instead O
of O
gun O
control O
. O

Education O

the O

Education O

In O

I O

that O
education B-claim

the I-claim

the I-claim
development I-claim

In B-premise

not I-premise
many I-premise
can I-premise

There B-premise

practically I-premise

They B-premise

As O
a O

these B-claim

have I-claim
the I-claim

are I-claim
definitely I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
mirror I-claim
for I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim
. O

We B-premise
definitely I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
want I-premise
our I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
luxurious I-premise
custom I-premise
or I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
just I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
similar I-premise

someone I-premise

especially I-premise
when I-premise
these I-premise
people I-premise

not I-premise

However O

the B-premise

what I-premise

that O
not B-premise

Thus O

only B-claim

not I-claim
enough I-claim

a I-claim

In O
conclusion O

That O

Mobile O
phones O
: O
faster O
communication O
vs O
social O
problems O

Recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
with O
regard O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
mobiles O
phones O
have O
negative O
effects O
on O
our O
social O
life O
. O

Indeed O
, O
mobile O
phones O
have O
widely O
been O
used O
by O
people O
of O
all O
ages O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
this B-claim
great I-claim
invention I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
21st I-claim
century I-claim
causes I-claim
many I-claim
problems I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
society I-claim
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
spending B-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
mobiles I-premise
phones I-premise
many I-premise
exert I-premise
an I-premise
adverse I-premise
effect I-premise
on I-premise
our I-premise
social I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
as B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
teenagers I-premise
increasingly I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
phones I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
lose I-premise
their I-premise
interests I-premise
on I-premise
daily I-premise
activities I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
meeting I-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
may I-premise
impair I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
negotiation I-premise
and I-premise
interpersonal I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
continuous B-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
mobile I-premise
phones I-premise
may I-premise
also I-premise
damage I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
eyesight I-premise
and I-premise
physical I-premise
posture I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
harmful I-claim
for I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
mobile I-claim
phones I-claim
frequently I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-claim
growing I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
mobiles I-claim
games I-claim
will I-claim
impact I-claim
their I-claim
mental I-claim
development I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there B-premise
many I-premise
game I-premise
applications I-premise
available I-premise
online I-premise
and I-premise
many I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
are I-premise
quite I-premise
aggressive I-premise
in I-premise
nature I-premise
. O

In B-premise
these I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
rewarded I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
their I-premise
characters I-premise
to I-premise
kill I-premise
or I-premise
shoot I-premise
monsters I-premise
or I-premise
characters I-premise
controlled I-premise
by I-premise
other I-premise
players I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
many I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
aggressive I-premise
feelings I-premise
, I-premise
thoughts I-premise
and I-premise
behaviors I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
frequent B-premise
conflicts I-premise
may I-premise
occur I-premise
during I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

However O
, O
we O
may O
perceive O
this O
issue O
from O
different O
viewpoints O
. O

Mobile B-premise
phones I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
smart I-premise
phones I-premise
, I-premise
has I-premise
made I-premise
our I-premise
communication I-premise
easy I-premise
and I-premise
convenience I-premise
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
, O
as B-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
telecommunication I-premise
companies I-premise
provide I-premise
us I-premise
with I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
internet I-premise
via I-premise
our I-premise
phones I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
sending I-premise
instant I-premise
messages I-premise
and I-premise
making I-premise
international I-premise
calls I-premise
free I-premise
of I-premise
charge I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
mobile B-claim
phones I-claim
have I-claim
shortened I-claim
the I-claim
distance I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
although O
mobile B-claim
phones I-claim
make I-claim
our I-claim
communication I-claim
faster I-claim
, O
it B-claim
also I-claim
gives I-claim
rise I-claim
to I-claim
many I-claim
social I-claim
problems I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
social I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
their I-claim
mental I-claim
health I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
i O
highly O
advocate O
that O
we O
should O
use O
mobile O
phone O
in O
moderation O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
these O
serious O
problems O
. O

The O
environment O
problems O
facing O
today O
's O
world O
are O
so O
great O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
countries O
are O
concerned O
with O
the O
environment O
problems O
. O

There O
is O
a O
viewpoint O
that O
the O
government O
and O
big O
firms O
should O
assume O
the O
responsibility O
to O
protect O
the O
environment O
and O
normal O
citizens O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
for O
that O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
both B-claim
government I-claim
and I-claim
common I-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
responsibility I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
, O
but O
we O
need O
to O
analyze O
some O
specific O
situations O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
solving B-claim
some I-claim
environmental I-claim
problems I-claim
needs I-claim
large I-claim
budgets I-claim
and I-claim
various I-claim
technologies I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
and I-claim
corporations I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
deal I-claim
with I-claim
these I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
air B-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
water I-premise
quality I-premise
has I-premise
concerned I-premise
many I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
is I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
implement I-premise
some I-premise
policies I-premise
and I-premise
invest I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
companies I-premise
also I-premise
can I-premise
enhance I-premise
their I-premise
technologies I-premise
to I-premise
curb I-premise
emission I-premise
of I-premise
contaminated I-premise
water I-premise
and I-premise
substances I-premise
. O

However O
, O
individuals B-premise
are I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
cope I-premise
with I-premise
these I-premise
things I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
and I-premise
firms I-premise
could I-premise
have I-premise
significant I-premise
influences I-premise
on I-premise
environmental I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
every I-premise
citizen I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
awareness I-premise
and I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
environment I-premise
protection I-premise
. O

This O
means O
that O
we B-claim
should I-claim
convey I-claim
corresponding I-claim
policies I-claim
and I-claim
knowledge I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
and I-claim
society I-claim
, O
and O
the B-premise
government I-premise
controls I-premise
many I-premise
influential I-premise
media I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
TV I-premise
stations I-premise
and I-premise
newspapers I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
environmental I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
related I-premise
policies I-premise
to I-premise
citizens I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
possible I-claim
for I-claim
ordinary I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
participate I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
actions I-claim
of I-claim
environment I-claim
protection I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
they I-claim
also I-claim
can I-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
improvement I-claim
of I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many B-premise
people I-premise
driving I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise
could I-premise
cause I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
overusing I-premise
plastic I-premise
packages I-premise
would I-premise
affect I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
gradually I-premise
change I-premise
some I-premise
lifestyles I-premise
in I-premise
these I-premise
daily I-premise
activities I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
many I-premise
significant I-premise
impacts I-premise
on I-premise
environmental I-premise
improvement I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
government I-claim
and I-claim
corporations I-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
more I-claim
responsibility I-claim
for I-claim
addressing I-claim
environmental I-claim
issues I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
every I-claim
citizen I-claim
also I-claim
can I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

Is O
it O
necessary O
to O
teach O
children O
handwriting O
? O

In O
this O
age O
of O
modern O
technology O
, O
some O
people O
usually O
underestimate O
the O
importance O
of O
teaching O
handwriting O
for O
children O
. O

To O
some O
people O
, O
it O
is O
considered O
as O
an O
arduous O
and O
time O
consuming O
task O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
children B-claim
are I-claim
those I-claim
who I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
under I-claim
instruction I-claim
of I-claim
handwriting I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Despite O
the O
convenience O
from O
up O
- O
to O
- O
date O
facilities O
, O
handwriting B-claim
still I-claim
plays I-claim
a I-claim
vital I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
this B-premise
approach I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
basis I-premise
tool I-premise
used I-premise
in I-premise
several I-premise
fields I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
taking I-premise
notes I-premise
, I-premise
doing I-premise
homework I-premise
and I-premise
writing I-premise
. O

It B-premise
enables I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
learners I-premise
' I-premise
spelling I-premise
capacity I-premise
and I-premise
accompany I-premise
reading I-premise
or I-premise
writing I-premise
disabilities I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
. O

Under B-premise
the I-premise
guidance I-premise
of I-premise
parents I-premise
or I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
benefit I-premise
from I-premise
practicing I-premise
handwriting I-premise
. O

This B-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
writing I-premise
will I-premise
encourage I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
more I-premise
attention I-premise
on I-premise
content I-premise
, I-premise
elaborate I-premise
in I-premise
details I-premise
and I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
organization I-premise
abilities I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
parents O
and O
schools O
should O
give O
priority O
on O
directing O
their O
kids O
about O
handwriting O
as O
poor B-claim
handwriting I-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
impact I-claim
on I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
school I-claim
performance I-claim
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
kids B-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
bad I-premise
at I-premise
handwriting I-premise
meet I-premise
difficulties I-premise
in I-premise
taking I-premise
notes I-premise
and I-premise
catching I-premise
up I-premise
lessons I-premise
. O

It B-premise
resulted I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
missing I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
details I-premise
during I-premise
their I-premise
works I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise
increasing I-premise
taking I-premise
advantage I-premise
of I-premise
advanced I-premise
equipment I-premise
could I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
be I-premise
lazier I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
subjective I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
writing I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
assistance I-premise
of I-premise
automatic I-premise
grammar I-premise
and I-premise
spelling I-premise
checking I-premise
in I-premise
office I-premise
word I-premise
, I-premise
learners I-premise
are I-premise
now I-premise
no I-premise
need I-premise
for I-premise
noticing I-premise
much I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
mistakes I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
fast O
and O
convenient O
modern O
devices O
bring O
to O
us O
in O
writing O
, O
handwriting B-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
a I-claim
needed I-claim
skill I-claim
for I-claim
all I-claim
of I-claim
people I-claim
, I-claim
especially I-claim
students I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
early I-claim
age I-claim
. O

The O
tax O
reduction O
of O
state O
school O
for O
parents O
who O
have O
children O
studying O
in O
private O
system O

Some O
people O
who O
send O
their O
children O
to O
private O
schools O
contend O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
taxes O
they O
pay O
for O
the O
state O
education O
is O
unreasonable O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
utterly O
convinced O
that O
these B-claim
taxes I-claim
are I-claim
absolutely I-claim
essential I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
by B-claim
paying I-claim
taxes I-claim
for I-claim
public I-claim
school I-claim
, I-claim
affluent I-claim
people I-claim
effectively I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
narrowing I-claim
down I-claim
the I-claim
gap I-claim
between I-claim
rich I-claim
and I-claim
poor I-claim
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
many B-premise
poor I-premise
families I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
afford I-premise
tuition I-premise
fees I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
kids I-premise
to I-premise
attend I-premise
a I-premise
course I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
the I-premise
tax I-premise
amount I-premise
for I-premise
which I-premise
they I-premise
pay I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
rich I-premise
may I-premise
help I-premise
a I-premise
vast I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
from I-premise
families I-premise
with I-premise
poverty I-premise
background I-premise
to I-premise
continue I-premise
their I-premise
studies I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
earn I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
tax I-claim
reduction I-claim
for I-claim
parents I-claim
of I-claim
children I-claim
studying I-claim
in I-claim
private I-claim
schools I-claim
would I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
waste I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
capital I-claim
. O

Obviously O
, O
this B-premise
reduction I-premise
would I-premise
cause I-premise
a I-premise
difficulty I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
tax I-premise
calculation I-premise
; O
therefore O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
would I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
recruit I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
workforce I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
handle I-premise
this I-premise
sophisticated I-premise
issue I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
would I-premise
also I-premise
pay I-premise
the I-premise
salary I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
excessive I-premise
officials I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
this I-premise
would I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
insufficient I-premise
investments I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
crucial I-premise
public I-premise
sectors I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
education I-premise
or I-premise
health I-premise
care I-premise
. O

Many O
parents O
supporting O
for O
the O
idea O
of O
tax O
discounts O
claim O
that O
such B-claim
tax I-claim
payments I-claim
are I-claim
unfair I-claim
for I-claim
them I-claim
. O

They O
point O
out O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
irrational I-premise
to I-premise
require I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
taxes I-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
use I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we B-premise
also I-premise
pay I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
services I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
even I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
experience I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
employ I-premise
like I-premise
police I-premise
or I-premise
fire I-premise
brigade I-premise
. O

We B-premise
certainly I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
hope I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
reduction I-premise
for I-premise
these I-premise
sorts I-premise
of I-premise
taxes I-premise
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
that O
taxes B-claim
paying I-claim
for I-claim
state I-claim
schools I-claim
are I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
compulsory I-claim
for I-claim
all I-claim
members I-claim
of I-claim
society I-claim
no I-claim
matter I-claim
where I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
enroll I-claim
in I-claim
. O

Arts O
and O
public O
services O
are O
both O
important O
to O
the O
community O
and O
should O
be O
invested O
properly O

There O
has O
been O
wide O
opinion O
that O
Government O
should O
invest O
more O
money O
on O
public O
services O
rather O
than O
arts O
such O
as O
music O
and O
theatre O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
perspective O
, O
both B-claim
public I-claim
services I-claim
and I-claim
arts I-claim
worth I-claim
investment I-claim
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
axiomatic O
that O
indispensable B-claim
public I-claim
services I-claim
like I-claim
hospital I-claim
and I-claim
school I-claim
worth I-claim
every I-claim
penny I-claim
investing I-claim
. O

Investing B-premise
in I-premise
hospitals I-premise
helps I-premise
improve I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
health I-premise
, I-premise
also I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
schools I-premise
assists I-premise
with I-premise
raising I-premise
our I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
education I-premise
level I-premise
. O

Apparently O
if B-premise
these I-premise
facilities I-premise
were I-premise
not I-premise
spent I-premise
adequately I-premise
, I-premise
our I-premise
standard I-premise
of I-premise
living I-premise
would I-premise
deteriorate I-premise
. O

But O
our B-claim
standard I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
also I-claim
depend I-claim
on I-claim
another I-claim
factor I-claim
- I-claim
spiritual I-claim
life I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
related I-claim
closely I-claim
with I-claim
arts I-claim
. O

Arts B-premise
include I-premise
many I-premise
forms I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
cinema I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
typical I-premise
. O

These B-premise
two I-premise
art I-premise
forms I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
provide I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
with I-premise
entertainment I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
contribute I-premise
significantly I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
economy I-premise
. O

The B-premise
income I-premise
of I-premise
film I-premise
and I-premise
music I-premise
industries I-premise
produce I-premise
millions I-premise
of I-premise
dollars I-premise
each I-premise
year I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
Goverment I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
K I-premise
- I-premise
pop I-premise
and I-premise
Hollywood I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
these I-premise
industries I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
survive I-premise
without I-premise
goverment I-premise
's I-premise
financial I-premise
assistance I-premise
. O

The O
long O
and O
the O
short O
of O
it O
, O
both B-claim
arts I-claim
and I-claim
public I-claim
services I-claim
are I-claim
important I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
community I-claim
and I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
invested I-claim
properly I-claim
. O

Modern O

While O
there O
is O
belief O
that O

a O
lost O
in O
traditional O

I O
would O
argue O
that O
although O
the B-claim
affect I-claim

is I-claim
undeniable I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim

contributed I-claim

the I-claim
preservation I-claim

Thanks B-claim
to I-claim
modern I-claim
technology I-claim
, I-claim
our I-claim
life I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
improved I-claim
with I-claim
many I-claim
gadgets I-claim
. O

The B-premise
invention I-premise
of I-premise
mobile I-premise

has I-premise
changed I-premise
our I-premise
traditional I-premise
ways I-premise
of I-premise
communicating I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
working I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
has I-premise
also I-premise
been I-premise
much I-premise
less I-premise
labourous I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
pass I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
assistance I-premise
of I-premise
electrical I-premise
machineries I-premise
. O

However O
, O
these B-premise
newfangled I-premise

replaced I-premise

Modern B-claim

I O

that O
this B-claim

a I-claim
worrying I-claim

which I-claim
has I-claim
negative I-claim

The B-premise
first I-premise
impression I-premise

the I-premise

seems I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
rich I-premise
while I-premise
not I-premise
having I-premise

work I-premise
hard I-premise
. O

This B-claim
gives I-claim
children I-claim
the I-claim
idea I-claim
that I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
hard I-claim
at I-claim
school I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
career I-claim

earning I-claim
a I-claim
living I-claim

Further O
more O

they B-premise
will I-premise

It B-premise

uncommon I-premise

Worse O
still O

without B-claim

media B-claim
should I-claim
shift I-claim
its I-claim
focus I-claim
from I-claim
covering I-claim
celebrities I-claim
to I-claim
elsewhere I-claim
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
children O
's O
access O
to O
the O
celebrities O
news O
on O
the O
media O
should O
be O
restricted O
and O
they O
should O
study O
only O
from O
the O
celebrities O
who O
can O
act O
positively O
. O

A O
greater O
proportion O
of O
the O
budget O
should O
be O
allotted O
to O
education O
and O
prevention O
issues O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
welfare O
state O
requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O
health O
education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
devote I-claim
a I-claim
greater I-claim
portion I-claim
of I-claim
their I-claim
health I-claim
budgets I-claim
to I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
means I-claim
for I-claim
precautions I-claim
. O

The B-premise
first I-premise
reason I-premise
why I-premise
education I-premise
and I-premise
preventative I-premise
measures I-premise
should I-premise
receive I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
budget I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
potential I-premise
improvements I-premise
in I-premise
health I-premise
system I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing B-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise
system I-premise
can I-premise
lead I-premise
hospitals I-premise
and I-premise
healthcare I-premise
centers I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
managed I-premise
effectively I-premise
which I-premise
will I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
better I-premise
treatments I-premise
for I-premise
current I-premise
patients I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
society B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
educated I-claim
and I-claim
became I-claim
aware I-claim
of I-claim
health I-claim
issues I-claim
so O
that O
the B-premise
potential I-premise
precautions I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
illnesses I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
taken I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
trying I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
treatment I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
increasing I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
patients I-premise
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments B-claim
should I-claim
allocate I-claim
more I-claim
budget I-claim
on I-claim
prevention I-claim
from I-claim
illness I-claim
and I-claim
providing I-claim
health I-claim
education I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
welfare I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
society I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there B-premise
is I-premise
nothing I-premise
more I-premise
important I-premise
than I-premise
health I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
welfare I-premise
come I-premise
with I-premise
health I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
a B-premise
government I-premise
's I-premise
role I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
providing I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
lead I-premise
its I-premise
citizens I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
from I-premise
potential I-premise
illness I-premise
that I-premise
can I-premise
cause I-premise
misery I-premise
in I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
lives I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
marketing I-premise
campaign I-premise
of I-premise
Ministry I-premise
of I-premise
Health I-premise
in I-premise
Turkey I-premise
which I-premise
aimed I-premise
smoking I-premise
problem I-premise
among I-premise
the I-premise
youth I-premise
increased I-premise
the I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
being I-premise
of I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
quit I-premise
smoking I-premise
and I-premise
adapted I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
campaign I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
greater I-claim
proportion I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
budget I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
allotted I-claim
to I-claim
education I-claim
and I-claim
prevention I-claim
issues I-claim
in I-claim
comparison I-claim
with I-claim
treatment I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
more I-claim
effective I-claim
health I-claim
system I-claim

greater I-claim
level I-claim

Fatherhood O
should O
be O
as O
present O
as O
motherhood O
in O
a O
child O
's O
life O
starting O
from O
the O
the O
birth O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
having O
and O
raising O
children O
can O
be O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
for O
families O
, O
the O
smallest O
component O
of O
the O
society O
. O

While O
mother O
's O
role O
is O
essential O
in O
a O
child O
's O
life O
, O
I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
fatherhood B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
as I-claim
vital I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
healty I-claim
parantage I-claim
as I-claim
much I-claim
as I-claim
motherhood I-claim
. O

The B-claim
first I-claim
reason I-claim
why I-claim
the I-claim
father I-claim
's I-claim
role I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
equal I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
mother I-claim
's I-claim
role I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
nature I-claim
of I-claim
parantage I-claim
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the B-premise
role I-premise
models I-premise
within I-premise
a I-premise
family I-premise
play I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
child I-premise
's I-premise
characteristics I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
in B-premise
a I-premise
traditional I-premise
Turkish I-premise
family I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
a I-premise
mother I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
sincere I-premise
and I-premise
thoughtful I-premise
approach I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
child I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
father I-premise
role I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
present I-premise
as I-premise
authoritarian I-premise
and I-premise
conversative I-premise
to I-premise
raise I-premise
a I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
behaved I-premise
child I-premise
. O

The B-claim
second I-claim
reason I-claim
why I-claim
I I-claim
believe I-claim
that I-claim
fatherood I-claim
is I-claim
as I-claim
important I-claim
as I-claim
motherhood I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
dynamics I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
relationships I-claim
today I-claim
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we B-premise
are I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
society I-premise
that I-premise
puts I-premise
a I-premise
significant I-premise
importance I-premise
to I-premise
gender I-premise
equality I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
aspect I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
relationships I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
family I-premise
formed I-premise
by I-premise
a I-premise
woman I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
housewife I-premise
role I-premise
who I-premise
looks I-premise
after I-premise
the I-premise
home I-premise
and I-premise
takes I-premise
care I-premise
of I-premise
children I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
man I-premise
who I-premise
brings I-premise
money I-premise
home I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
seen I-premise
anymore I-premise
in I-premise
today I-premise
's I-premise
society I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
all B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
couple I-premise
duties I-premise
are I-premise
performed I-premise
equally I-premise
and I-premise
interchangeably I-premise
by I-premise
individuals I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
having B-premise
and I-premise
raising I-premise
children I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
different I-premise
than I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
daily I-premise
activity I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
fatherhood B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
as I-claim
present I-claim
as I-claim
motherhood I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
child I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
starting I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
the I-claim
birth I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
providing I-claim
appropriate I-claim
parenthood I-claim
and I-claim
having I-claim
healthy I-claim
family I-claim
relationships I-claim
. O

Children O
should O
studying O
hard O
or O
playing O
sport O
? O

Both O
can O
improve O
their O
future O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
studying O
hard O
is O
essential O
part O
for O
children O
, O
otherwise O
others O
people O
think O
that O
playing O
sport O
is O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
both B-claim
of I-claim
studying I-claim
hard I-claim
and I-claim
playing I-claim
sports I-claim
are I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
to I-claim
children I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
studying B-claim
hard I-claim
will I-claim
give I-claim
children I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Studying B-premise
hard I-premise
gives I-premise
children I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
skills I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Naturally O
, O
children O
will O
be O
growing O
up O
and O
looking O
for O
their O
job O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
children B-premise
who I-premise
always I-premise
studying I-premise
hard I-premise
and I-premise
getting I-premise
high I-premise
achievement I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
pass I-premise
qualification I-premise
for I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
great I-premise
work I-premise
at I-premise
multinational I-premise
company I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
working I-premise
at I-premise
multinational I-premise
company I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
result I-premise
is I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
earn I-premise
higher I-premise
salary I-premise
. O

The O
message O
is O
when B-premise
you I-premise
always I-premise
studying I-premise
harder I-premise
than I-premise
others I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
get I-premise
best I-premise
results I-premise
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
playing B-claim
sports I-claim
will I-claim
give I-claim
good I-claim
effects I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
. O

There O
are O
many O
popular O
sports O
among O
children O
such O
as O
football O
, O
basketball O
, O
and O
volleyball O
. O

Also O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
benefit I-premise
when I-premise
children I-premise
doing I-premise
sport I-premise
. O

Firstly O
, O
children B-premise
who I-premise
always I-premise
playing I-premise
sport I-premise
like I-premise
football I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
active I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
team I-premise
- I-premise
player I-premise
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
good I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
, O
because O
indirectly B-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
socialize I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
team I-premise
. O

That B-premise
will I-premise
make I-premise
children I-premise
getting I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
friends I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
can I-premise
contribute I-premise
positively I-premise
to I-premise
community I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
playing B-premise
sport I-premise
makes I-premise
children I-premise
getting I-premise
healthy I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
being I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
both B-claim
studying I-claim
hard I-claim
at I-claim
school I-claim
and I-claim
playing I-claim
sports I-claim
can I-claim
improve I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
future I-claim
. O
