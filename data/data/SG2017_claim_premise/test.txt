International O
tourism O
is O
now O
more O
common O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
50 O
years O
have O
seen O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
tourist O
traveling O
worldwide O
. O

While O
some O
might O
think O
the B-claim
tourism I-claim
bring I-claim
large I-claim
profit I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
destination I-claim
countries I-claim
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
this B-claim
industry I-claim
has I-claim
affected I-claim
the I-claim
cultural I-claim
attributes I-claim
and I-claim
damaged I-claim
the I-claim
natural I-claim
environment I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
tourist I-claim
destinations I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
an O
undeniable O
fact O
that O
tourists B-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
cultures I-premise
will I-premise
probably I-premise
cause I-premise
changes I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
cultural I-premise
identity I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
tourist I-premise
destinations I-premise
. O

Take B-premise
Thailand I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
Vietnam I-premise
War I-premise
, I-premise
many I-premise
American I-premise
soldiers I-premise
came I-premise
to I-premise
Thailand I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
break I-premise
and I-premise
involved I-premise
in I-premise
sexual I-premise
and I-premise
drug I-premise
activities I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
huge I-premise
demands I-premise
caused I-premise
many I-premise
local I-premise
businesses I-premise
opened I-premise
and I-premise
expanded I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
illegally I-premise
involved I-premise
in I-premise
under I-premise
- I-premise
age I-premise
prostitutes I-premise
to I-premise
maximize I-premise
their I-premise
profits I-premise
. O

This B-premise
was I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
lack I-premise
of I-premise
adequate I-premise
controls I-premise
by I-premise
authorities I-premise
and I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
bad I-premise
image I-premise
of I-premise
Thailand I-premise
tourism I-premise
. O

Therefore O
this O
proves O
that O
international B-claim
tourism I-claim
can I-claim
create I-claim
negative I-claim
impacts I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
destination I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
clear O
evidences O
that O
tourism B-premise
increasingly I-premise
create I-premise
harms I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
natural I-premise
habitats I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
destination I-premise
appeals I-premise
. O

As B-premise
the I-premise
Australia I-premise
’s I-premise
Great I-premise
Barrier I-premise
Reef I-premise
has I-premise
shown I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
billion I-premise
visitors I-premise
per I-premise
annum I-premise
has I-premise
generated I-premise
immense I-premise
destruction I-premise
to I-premise
this I-premise
nature I-premise
wonder I-premise
, I-premise
namely I-premise
breaking I-premise
the I-premise
corals I-premise
caused I-premise
by I-premise
walking I-premise
or I-premise
throwing I-premise
boat I-premise
’s I-premise
anchors I-premise
, I-premise
dropping I-premise
fuel I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
sorts I-premise
of I-premise
pollutions I-premise
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
many B-premise
marine I-premise
lives I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
endangered I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
extremes I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
reef I-premise
become I-premise
uninhabitable I-premise
for I-premise
these I-premise
marine I-premise
species I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
tourism B-claim
has I-claim
threatened I-claim
the I-claim
nature I-claim
environments I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
tourism I-claim
has I-claim
created I-claim
threatening I-claim
pressure I-claim
on I-claim
both I-claim
the I-claim
sociocultural I-claim
and I-claim
natural I-claim
environments I-claim
. O

If O
authorities O
do O
not O
take O
steps O
to O
appropriately O
conserve O
these O
precious O
values O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

Living O
and O
studying O
overseas O

It O
is O
every O
student O
's O
desire O
to O
study O
at O
a O
good O
university O
and O
experience O
a O
new O
environment O
. O

While O
some O
students O
study O
and O
live O
overseas O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
some O
prefer O
to O
study O
home O
because O
of O
the O
difficulties O
of O
living O
and O
studying O
overseas O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
one B-claim
who I-claim
studies I-claim
overseas I-claim
will I-claim
gain I-claim
many I-claim
skills I-claim
throughout I-claim
this I-claim
experience I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
studying B-claim
at I-claim
an I-claim
overseas I-claim
university I-claim
gives I-claim
individuals I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
social I-claim
skills I-claim
by I-claim
interacting I-claim
and I-claim
communicating I-claim
with I-claim
students I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
origins I-claim
and I-claim
cultures I-claim
. O

Compared B-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
peers I-premise
studying I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
home I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
living I-premise
overseas I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
successful I-premise
in I-premise
adapting I-premise
himself I-premise
/ I-premise
herself I-premise
into I-premise
new I-premise
environments I-premise
and I-premise
situations I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
living B-claim
and I-claim
studying I-claim
overseas I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
irreplaceable I-claim
experience I-claim
when I-claim
it I-claim
comes I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
standing I-claim
on I-claim
your I-claim
own I-claim
feet I-claim
. O

One B-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
living I-premise
overseas I-premise
will I-premise
of I-premise
course I-premise
struggle I-premise
with I-premise
loneliness I-premise
, I-premise
living I-premise
away I-premise
from I-premise
family I-premise
and I-premise
friends I-premise
but O
those B-premise
difficulties I-premise
will I-premise
turn I-premise
into I-premise
valuable I-premise
experiences I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
following I-premise
steps I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise
one I-premise
will I-premise
learn I-premise
living I-premise
without I-premise
depending I-premise
on I-premise
anyone I-premise
else I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
employers B-premise
are I-premise
mostly I-premise
looking I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
international I-premise
and I-premise
language I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

Becoming B-premise
successful I-premise
in I-premise
this I-premise
study I-premise
will I-premise
give I-premise
the I-premise
student I-premise
an I-premise
edge I-premise
in I-premise
job I-premise
market I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
one B-claim
who I-claim
has I-claim
studied I-claim
and I-claim
lived I-claim
overseas I-claim
will I-claim
become I-claim
more I-claim
eligible I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
job I-claim
than I-claim
his I-claim
/ I-claim
her I-claim
peers I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
difficulties I-claim
a I-claim
student I-claim
might I-claim
face I-claim
when I-claim
studying I-claim
and I-claim
living I-claim
overseas I-claim
. O

However O
, O
living B-claim
and I-claim
studying I-claim
overseas I-claim
gives I-claim
the I-claim
individual I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
perspective I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
subject I-claim
that I-claim
is I-claim
studied I-claim
or I-claim
in I-claim
general I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Studies O
abroad O
and O
the O
cultural O
aspect O
of O
the O
experience O
Studying O
abroad O
is O
one O
very O
common O
thing O
that O
students O
do O
, O
and O
they O
have O
different O
reasons O
for O
that O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
studying B-claim
abroad I-claim
has I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

Students B-claim
gain I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
out I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
experience I-claim
personally I-claim
, I-claim
academically I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
culturally I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
students B-claim
who I-claim
study I-claim
outside I-claim
their I-claim
countries I-claim
can I-claim
get I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
experience I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
country I-claim
. O

Living B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
country I-premise
requires I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
flexibility I-premise
and I-premise
adaptability I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
character I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
students B-premise
might I-premise
face I-premise
many I-premise
challenges I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
host I-premise
country I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
obstacles I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
encounter I-premise
. O

Overcoming B-premise
problems I-premise
teaches I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
mature I-premise
and I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
independence I-premise
. O

One O
other O
important O
factor O
is O
the B-claim
new I-claim
academic I-claim
experience I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
obtain I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
institution I-claim
where I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
pursuing I-claim
their I-claim
studies I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
they B-premise
will I-premise
get I-premise
exposed I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
different I-premise
educational I-premise
system I-premise
. O

They B-premise
will I-premise
meet I-premise
new I-premise
professors I-premise
and I-premise
new I-premise
classmates I-premise
which I-premise
makes I-premise
the I-premise
academic I-premise
experience I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
that I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
home I-premise
country I-premise
. O

Most B-claim
important I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
cultural I-claim
aspect I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
experience I-claim
. O

While B-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
foreign I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
culture I-premise
of I-premise
that I-premise
country I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they B-premise
can I-premise
meet I-premise
different I-premise
people I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
thinking I-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
customs I-premise
and I-premise
traditions I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
way I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Learning B-premise
about I-premise
others I-premise
' I-premise
cultures I-premise
is I-premise
so I-premise
important I-premise
. O

It B-premise
contributes I-premise
in I-premise
building I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
understanding I-premise
in I-premise
us I-premise
of I-premise
how I-premise
we I-premise
see I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

It B-premise
makes I-premise
us I-premise
more I-premise
open I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
accept I-premise
different I-premise
ideas I-premise
and I-premise
thoughts I-premise
. O

Also O
it B-premise
educates I-premise
us I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
studying B-claim
abroad I-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
have I-claim
advantages I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
can I-claim
change I-claim
us I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
very I-claim
positive I-claim
way I-claim
. O

It O
can O
influence O
us O
in O
different O
aspects O
of O
life O
. O

Advertisements O

consumer O
goods O
Everyday O
, O
companies O

a O
huge O
number O
of O
different O
products O
to O
consumers O

The B-claim
most I-claim
effective I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
convince I-claim
consumers I-claim
to I-claim
purchase I-claim
a I-claim
product I-claim
is I-claim
through I-claim
advertising I-claim
. O

However O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
sufficient I-premise
in I-premise
itself I-premise
. O

The B-premise
product I-premise
also I-premise
should I-premise
satisfy I-premise
the I-premise
needs I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
consumers I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
advertising B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
major I-claim
reason I-claim
for I-claim
high I-claim
sales I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
product I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

We B-premise
are I-premise
mainly I-premise
introduced I-premise
to I-premise
products I-premise
through I-premise
advertisements I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
advertisers B-claim
push I-claim
the I-claim
limits I-claim
of I-claim
creativity I-claim
to I-claim
dispose I-claim
the I-claim
consumers I-claim
to I-claim
purchase I-claim
the I-claim
product I-claim
. O

When B-premise
the I-premise
consumers I-premise
are I-premise
impressed I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
a I-premise
product I-premise
is I-premise
advertised I-premise

they I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
convinced I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
product I-premise

a I-premise
need I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
cases I-premise
. O

Recently B-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
creative I-premise
advertisements I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
soft I-premise

product I-premise
on I-premise

The B-premise

a I-premise
desired I-premise

that I-premise
soft I-premise

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
the B-premise
number I-premise

Also O

the I-claim
most I-claim
effective I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
create I-claim
a I-claim
well I-claim
- I-claim
known I-claim
product I-claim
. O

Consumers B-premise
tend I-premise

purchase I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
known I-premise
product I-premise
when I-premise
it I-premise
comes I-premise
to I-premise
picking I-premise
one I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
two I-premise
different I-premise

When B-premise
a I-premise

it I-premise

trustworthy I-premise

no I-premise

what I-premise

However O
, O
it B-premise
also I-premise

affordable I-premise

Considering O
this O
fact O

They B-claim
make I-claim

In O
conclusion O

as O
I O
believe O
that O
consumers O
should O
consider O
major O
needs O
when O
they O
purchase O
goods O
, O
high B-claim
sales I-claim
are I-claim
obviously I-claim
a I-claim
reflection I-claim

Paying O

is O
the O
only O
motivation O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
essay O
is O
to O
discuss O
whether O

not O
the O
only O
way O
to O
motivate O
employees O
to O
be O
more O
hard O
- O
working O

is O
by O

In O
this O
essay O

I O
would O
start O
by O
analyzing O
the O
factors O
for O
higher O
yields O
and O
finish O
by O
stating O
my O
position O
on O
this O
. O

A B-claim
raise I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
promotion I-claim
can I-claim
no I-claim
doubt I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
morale I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
working I-claim
places I-claim
. O

Workers B-premise
understand I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
harder I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
the I-premise
boss I-premise
' I-premise
expectations I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
themselves I-premise
worthwhile I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
junior B-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
teachers I-premise
have I-premise
great I-premise
responsibility I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
private I-premise
lives I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
going I-premise
through I-premise
adolescence I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
their I-premise
school I-premise
work I-premise
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
phase I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
hard I-premise
and I-premise
get I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
high I-premise
school I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
teachers I-premise
receive I-premise
higher I-premise
salaries I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
more I-premise
extra I-premise
time I-premise
mentoring I-premise
the I-premise
youngsters I-premise
rather I-premise
than I-premise
hoping I-premise
they I-premise
learn I-premise
in I-premise
cram I-premise
schools I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
forth I-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
this I-premise
is I-premise
what I-premise
is I-premise
happening I-premise
in I-premise
Taiwan I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
creating B-claim
an I-claim
enjoyable I-claim
working I-claim
environment I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
realistic I-claim
and I-claim
essential I-claim
if I-claim
one I-claim
wishes I-claim
an I-claim
increase I-claim
in I-claim
productivity I-claim
and I-claim
better I-claim
employee I-claim
performances I-claim
. O

Take B-premise
Google I-premise
for I-premise

, I-premise
the I-premise
company I-premise
offers I-premise
recreation I-premise
rooms I-premise
and I-premise

a I-premise
more I-premise

supportive I-premise
workforce I-premise
. O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
the B-premise
employers I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
sure I-premise
the I-premise

actually I-premise

To O
sum O
up O

I O
believe O
that O
a B-claim

Alternatively O

providing B-claim
a I-claim

can I-claim
fundamentally I-claim

they B-claim

therefore I-claim
do I-claim
their I-claim

Some O

In B-premise

the B-premise

In O

English B-premise

However O

the O

Even O
English B-premise

a I-premise
sophisticated I-premise

it B-premise

who I-premise

them I-premise

crudity I-premise

Personally O

English B-claim

we B-claim

The O

led O

the O
proposal O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
time I-claim

the I-claim
proliferation I-claim

Obviously O

the O
media O
is O
often O
portrayed O
as O
extreme O

attract O

This B-claim
will I-claim
definitely I-claim
set I-claim
a I-claim

for I-claim
the I-claim
immature I-claim
audiences I-claim
who I-claim
, I-claim
lacking I-claim
correct I-claim
parental I-claim
guidance I-claim
and I-claim
abilities I-claim
to I-claim
differentiate I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
from I-claim
wrong I-claim
, I-claim
are I-claim
prone I-claim
to I-claim
go I-claim
astray I-claim
by I-claim
imitating I-claim
the I-claim
violent I-claim
behaviors I-claim

the I-premise

It B-premise

Violence B-premise

as I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
facts I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
certainly I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
reported I-premise

However O
, O
excessive B-claim
violence I-claim
would I-claim
offer I-claim
misleading I-claim
information I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
public I-claim
and I-claim
exert I-claim
detrimental I-claim
influence I-claim

the I-claim
society I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
recently I-premise
reported I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
news I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
seventeen I-premise
- I-premise
year I-premise
- I-premise
old I-premise
boy I-premise
killed I-premise
all I-premise
his I-premise
family I-premise

one I-premise
sister I-premise
and I-premise
two I-premise
parents I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
hatred I-premise
and I-premise
jealousy I-premise
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
world I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
inclined I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
extreme I-premise
approach I-premise
to I-premise
tackle I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
problem I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
excessive I-premise
violence I-premise
exposure I-premise
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
that O
our B-claim
society I-claim
is I-claim
occupied I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
violent I-claim
scenes I-claim
and I-claim
plots I-claim
at I-claim
present I-claim
. O

What B-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
do I-claim
immediately I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
strengthen I-claim
censorship I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
the I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
in I-claim
media I-claim
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
violent O
crime O
rate O
will O
rise O
continuously O
and O
out O
of O
control O
someday O
. O

Should O
all O
the O
advertisements O
be O
banned O
? O

Never O
in O
history O
was O
advertising O
industry O
so O
developed O
as O
in O
modern O
society O
and O
it O
has O
led O
to O
some O
adverse O
sentiments O
in O
public O
because O
some O
deliver O
exaggerated O
and O
fake O
information O
. O

Hence O
whether O
we O
should O
ban O
all O
the O
advertisements O
or O
not O
has O
aroused O
much O
controversy O
of O
the O
public O
. O

My O
view O
is O
that O
while B-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
are I-claim
disturbing I-claim
, I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
overlook I-claim
other I-claim
merits I-claim
the I-claim
advertisements I-claim
bring I-claim
. O

First O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
unfair I-claim
to I-claim
restrict I-claim
those I-claim
public I-claim
service I-claim
advertisements I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
creative I-claim
and I-claim
inspiring I-claim
. O

In O
fact O
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
making I-premise
profits I-premise
but I-premise
taking I-premise
a I-premise
role I-premise
of I-premise
disseminating I-premise
valued I-premise
culture I-premise
, I-premise
good I-premise
moral I-premise
traits I-premise
and I-premise
calling I-premise
for I-premise
helps I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
disabled I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
poor I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
publicizing B-claim
brand I-claim
image I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
particular I-claim
product I-claim
of I-claim
mass I-claim
media I-claim
could I-claim
boost I-claim
sales I-claim
for I-claim
companies I-claim
. O

In O
a O
larger O
sense O
, O
it B-premise
could I-premise
simulate I-premise
household I-premise
spending I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
promote I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
country I-premise
. O

A B-premise
recent I-premise
study I-premise
shows I-premise
that I-premise
after I-premise
launching I-premise
an I-premise
advertising I-premise
campaign I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
sales I-premise
revenue I-premise
would I-premise
increase I-premise
by I-premise
40 I-premise
% I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
very I-premise
fact I-premise
to I-premise
verify I-premise
its I-premise
positive I-premise
influences I-premise
on I-premise
economic I-premise
. O

That O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
however O
, O
that O
advertisements O
have O
no O
downsides O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the B-claim
advertising I-claim
expenses I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
higher I-claim
product I-claim
price I-claim
and I-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
express I-claim
fake I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
creating I-claim
information I-claim
asymmetry I-claim
between I-claim
consumers I-claim
and I-claim
companies I-claim
. O

Yet O
, O
its B-premise
merits I-premise
still I-premise
outweigh I-premise
these I-premise
downsides I-premise
. O

Taken O
all O
together O
, O
advertisements B-claim
have I-claim
its I-claim
social I-claim
responsibility I-claim
and I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
economic I-claim
growth I-claim
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
all O
of O
them O
. O

However O
, O
if O
those O
with O
exaggerated O
and O
fake O
information O
could O
be O
banned O
, O
advertisements O
would O
be O
welcomed O
by O
more O
. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
relax O
is O
by O
exercises O

In O
modern O
society O
, O
people O
often O
face O
many O
difficulties O
under O
great O
stress O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
many O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
relax O
. O

Although O
miscellaneous O
people O
may O
apply O
diverse O
strategies O
, O
such O
as O
reading O
, O
watching O
movies O
, O
or O
working O
in O
their O
gardens O
, O
I O
argue O
that O
the B-claim
most I-claim
suitable I-claim
method I-claim
of I-claim
reducing I-claim
stress I-claim
for I-claim
modern I-claim
people I-claim
is I-claim
by I-claim
different I-claim
kinds I-claim
of I-claim
exercise I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
improve I-claim
health I-claim
conditions I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
bring I-claim
positive I-claim
emotions I-claim
. O

It O
is O

The B-premise
latter I-premise
one I-premise

I O

There O

no O

that O
our B-premise

In O

Once B-premise

the I-premise
diversity I-premise
of I-premise

Additionally O

zoos B-claim
afford I-claim
a I-claim
platform I-claim

education I-claim

Further O

It O
is O
true O
that O
some B-premise

systematic I-premise
management I-premise

. O

In O
order O
to O
protect O
animals O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
zoos B-claim
offer I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
man I-claim
- I-claim
made I-claim
environment I-claim
which I-claim
could I-claim
prolong I-claim
the I-claim

cultivate I-claim
the I-claim

What O

Advertising O
- O
positive O
or O
negative O
part O
of O
our O
lives O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
use O
of O
advertisement O
through O
different O
forms O
of O
media O
such O
as O
newspapers O
, O
radio O
and O
television O
has O
become O
very O
prevalent O
, O
so O
it O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
today O
's O
society O
. O

Many O
believe O
that O
advertising O
has O
brought O
great O
benefits O
to O
lives O
therefore O
it O
should O
be O
considered O
a O
positive O
activity O
while O
others O
have O
held O
a O
complete O
different O
idea O
about O
this O
. O

Both O
views O
will O
be O
critiqued O
before O
a O
reasonable O
conclusion O
is O
drawn O
. O

First O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
understood O
that O
advertising B-premise
is I-premise
carried I-premise
out I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
main I-premise
purpose I-premise
of I-premise
promoting I-premise
different I-premise
products I-premise
and I-premise
services I-premise
or I-premise
encouraging I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
consume I-premise
more I-premise
. O

Advertisements B-claim
are I-claim
, I-claim
therefore I-claim
, I-claim
very I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
many I-claim
businesses I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
sales I-claim
and I-claim
hence I-claim
profits I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
to B-claim
consumers I-claim
, I-claim
advertising I-claim
can I-claim
bring I-claim
them I-claim
many I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
customers B-premise
of I-premise
telecommunication I-premise
services I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
idea I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
current I-premise
offers I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
companies I-premise
and O
hence O
they B-premise
can I-premise
compare I-premise
them I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
decision I-premise
in I-premise
choosing I-premise
their I-premise
internet I-premise
or I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
plans I-premise
. O

From O
all O
of O
these O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
see O
why O
the O
idea O
that O
advertising O
is O
a O
positive O
part O
of O
life O
will O
garner O
strong O
support O
. O

However O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
people O
have O
argued O
against O
advertising O
due O
to O
its O
negative O
impacts O
. O

Firstly O
, O
a B-claim
huge I-claim
amount I-claim
of I-claim
different I-claim
advertisements I-claim
could I-claim
be I-claim
sent I-claim
automatically I-claim
by I-claim
a I-claim
system I-claim
to I-claim
personal I-claim
phones I-claim
or I-claim
email I-claim
addresses I-claim
, I-claim
this I-claim
is I-claim
generally I-claim
known I-claim
as I-claim
spam I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
causes I-claim
discomfort I-claim
or I-claim
even I-claim
annoyance I-claim
to I-claim
many I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
advertising B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
very I-premise
expensive I-premise
and I-premise
not I-premise
every I-premise
advertising I-premise
campaign I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
done I-premise
successfully I-premise
and I-premise
brings I-premise
good I-premise
results I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
advertising B-claim
is I-claim
believed I-claim
by I-claim
many I-claim
, I-claim
a I-claim
financial I-claim
burden I-claim
to I-claim
businesses I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
after O
analyzing O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
of O
advertising O
, O
both O
of O
the O
views O
have O
strong O
support O
, O
but O
it O
is O
felt O
that O
more B-claim
good I-claim
comes I-claim
from I-claim
advertising I-claim
than I-claim
bad I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-claim
idea I-claim
that I-claim
advertising I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
supported I-claim
. O

It O
is O
better O
for O
children O
to O
grow O
up O
in O
the O
countryside O
than O
in O
a O
big O
city O
? O

Nowadays O
living O
is O
possible O
on O
every O
place O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
still O
there O
are O
some O
differences O
among O
them O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
big B-claim
cities I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
place I-claim
for I-claim
bringing I-claim
up I-claim
children I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
education B-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
in I-premise
comparison I-premise
with I-premise
countrysides I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
my I-premise
country I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
universities I-premise
and I-premise
institutes I-premise
are I-premise
located I-premise
in I-premise
cities I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
todays I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
idea I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
past I-claim
their I-claim
first I-claim
earlier I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
cities I-claim
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
acknowledged I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
creational I-premise
facilities I-premise
are I-premise
built I-premise
in I-premise
cities I-premise
. O

Children B-claim
who I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
cities I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
entertainment I-claim
. O

For O
example O
playgrounds B-premise
, I-premise
parks I-premise
, I-premise
science I-premise
museums I-premise
, I-premise
cinemas I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

However O
, O
in B-premise
countrysides I-premise
we I-premise
hardly I-premise
ever I-premise
see I-premise
creational I-premise
facilities I-premise
. O

Children B-premise
who I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
countrysides I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
pass I-premise
their I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
farms I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
in B-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
children I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
media I-premise
easily I-premise
, O
so O
they B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
things I-claim
by I-claim
watching I-claim
television I-claim
and I-claim
surfing I-claim
through I-claim
the I-claim
net I-claim
. O

Via B-premise
internet I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
connection I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
children I-premise
all I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
, O
therefor O
they B-claim
can I-claim
exchange I-claim
their I-claim
knowledge I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
different I-claim
cultures I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
although O
countrysides B-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
advantages I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
fresh I-claim
air I-claim
, I-claim
peace I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
etc I-claim
. O

Today B-claim
's I-claim
children I-claim
needs I-claim
somethings I-claim
to I-claim
entertain I-claim
them I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
occupy I-claim
their I-claim
leisure I-claim
time I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
. O

A O
single O
international O
language O
or O
not O
? O

The O
21st O
century O
has O
witnessed O
the O
sweeping O
trends O
of O
globalization O
, O
which O
raises O
people O

concerns O
about O
whether O
a O
single O
international O
language O
should O
be O
a O
necessity O
or O
not O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
a B-claim
universal I-claim
language I-claim
playing I-claim
the I-claim
dominant I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
international I-claim
community I-claim
is I-claim
of I-claim
vital I-claim
significance I-claim
to I-claim
global I-claim
people I-claim
. O

It O
is O
especially O
true O
if O
we O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
a B-premise
single I-premise
international I-premise
language I-premise
plays I-premise
a I-premise
pivotal I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
global I-premise
economic I-premise
cooperation I-premise
. O

As B-premise
businessmen I-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
countries I-premise
have I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
more I-premise
efficiently I-premise
and I-premise
deeply I-premise
on I-premise
trade I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
intensify I-premise
the I-premise
transnational I-premise
cooperation I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
without B-premise
the I-premise
availability I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
that I-premise
misunderstanding I-premise
and I-premise
conflicts I-premise
would I-premise
ensue I-premise
over I-premise
business I-premise
negotiations I-premise
, I-premise
impeding I-premise
collaborations I-premise
between I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
a B-claim
single I-claim
international I-claim
language I-claim
serves I-claim
an I-claim
economic I-claim
purpose I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
a B-claim
universal I-claim
language I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
integral I-claim
part I-claim
of I-claim
cultural I-claim
communication I-claim
and I-claim
interactions I-claim
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
equipped I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
single I-premise
international I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
tell I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
smoothly I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
countries I-premise
' I-premise
specific I-premise
cultures I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
traditional I-premise
customs I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
modern I-premise
lifestyles I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
enables I-premise
people I-premise

expand I-premise
their I-premise
outlooks I-premise
, I-premise
viewing I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
in I-premise
new I-premise
angles I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
people I-premise
travel I-premise
to I-premise
foreign I-premise
countries I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
introduce I-premise
the I-premise
tourist I-premise

such I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
command I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
universal I-premise

, I-premise
helping I-premise
foreign I-premise
visitors I-premise
have I-premise
an I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
exotic I-premise

. O

In O
spite O
of O
this O
, O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O
a O

can O
not O
be O

To O
be O
more O

, O
a B-claim

may I-claim

erode I-claim
the I-claim

This O

eroding I-premise
a I-premise

For O
instance O
, O
some B-premise
Asians I-premise
are I-premise
seeking I-premise
individualism I-premise
, I-premise
previously I-premise
denied I-premise
by I-premise
many I-premise
Asian I-premise

, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they B-premise
have I-premise
gradually I-premise
identified I-premise

such I-premise

American I-premise

Therefore O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
a B-claim

On O
the O

every B-claim

Whenever O

As O

become O
a O
common O
passion O
which O
passed O
over O
every O

, O
popular B-claim
sports I-claim

can I-claim
help I-claim
reduce I-claim

remarkably I-claim
and I-claim
promote I-claim

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
sports B-premise
events I-premise
are I-premise
good I-premise
chances I-premise

excellent I-premise
athletes I-premise

that O
they B-claim

break I-claim
records I-claim
and I-claim
bring I-claim
victories I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

Because O
a B-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
gather I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
host I-premise

, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
good I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise

Consequently O
, O
sport B-claim
events I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
spirit I-claim
of I-claim
healthiness I-claim
, I-claim
honesty I-claim

can I-claim
help I-claim

After B-premise
sharing I-premise
competitive I-premise

interesting I-premise

in I-premise
each I-premise
competition I-premise

the I-premise

which I-premise

lead I-premise

an I-premise
improvement I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise

Secondly O
, O
sporting B-premise

play I-premise
an I-premise
essential I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
raising I-premise
patriotic I-premise
emotions I-premise

both I-premise
athletes I-premise

Seeing B-premise

honored I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
emotional I-premise
moments I-premise
to I-premise
each I-premise

The B-premise
athlete I-premise
also I-premise
seems I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise

he I-premise
wants I-premise

When B-premise
witnessing I-premise

many I-premise
of I-premise

can I-premise
stop I-premise

our I-premise

. O

For O
instance O
, O
when B-premise
Vietnam I-premise
became I-premise
the I-premise
champion I-premise
of I-premise
SEAGAMES I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
2008 I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
festival I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
permeated I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
streets I-premise
. O

People B-premise
from I-premise
all I-premise
ages I-premise
turned I-premise
out I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
streets I-premise
with I-premise
flags I-premise

and I-premise

they I-premise
sang I-premise
aloud I-premise
songs I-premise
of I-premise
Ho I-premise

Minh I-premise
President I-premise
. O

The B-premise
eager I-premise
atmosphere I-premise
lasted I-premise
many I-premise
next I-premise
days I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some B-premise
hooligans I-premise
were I-premise
so I-premise
excited I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
took I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
motor I-premise
racing I-premise
or I-premise
using I-premise
fireworks I-premise
illegally I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
hooligans I-premise
only I-premise
took I-premise
a I-premise
minority I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
sport B-claim
events I-claim
help I-claim
to I-claim
wake I-claim
up I-claim
love I-claim
and I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
strongly I-claim
in I-claim
each I-claim
citizen I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
international B-claim
sporting I-claim
occasions I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
effective I-claim
solutions I-claim
to I-claim
tensions I-claim
among I-claim
nations I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
a I-claim
stimulant I-claim
for I-claim
releasing I-claim
patriotic I-claim
emotions I-claim
safely I-claim
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
recommend O
that O
big O
sports O
events O
should O
be O
held O
more O
frequently O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Children O
engagement O
in O
paid O
work O

In O
many O
countries O
, O
children O
are O
educated O
from O
their O
young O
age O
to O
be O
independent O
and O
responsible O
for O
their O
actions O
. O

Their O
parents O
allow O
them O
to O
take O
some O
jobs O
because O
these O
jobs O
can O
help O
them O
learn O
and O
take O
responsibilities O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
educational O
measure O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the B-claim
benefits I-claim
of I-claim
children I-claim
engagement I-claim
in I-claim
paid I-claim
work I-claim
outweigh I-claim
its I-claim
drawbacks I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
children B-premise
can I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
hardship I-premise
of I-premise
earning I-premise
money I-premise
. O

When B-premise
they I-premise
take I-premise
some I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
paid I-premise
work I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
looking I-premise
after I-premise
babies I-premise
, I-premise
doing I-premise
housework I-premise
and I-premise
keeping I-premise
shops I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
some I-premise
life I-premise
experience I-premise
and I-premise
skills I-premise
which I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
mature I-premise
and I-premise
can I-premise
deal I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
different I-premise
situations I-premise
in I-premise
real I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
they B-claim
are I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
understand I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
' I-claim
hardship I-claim
, I-claim
to I-claim
respect I-claim
values I-claim
of I-claim
money I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
form I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
habit I-claim
of I-claim
saving I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
when B-claim
children I-claim
take I-claim
jobs I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
tend I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
responsible O
because O
whether B-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
earn I-premise
money I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
will I-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
effectiveness I-premise
and I-premise
attitudes I-premise
in I-premise
working I-premise
. O

To B-premise
keep I-premise
their I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
children I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
their I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
their I-premise
duties I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
works I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
shop I-premise
assistant I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
keep I-premise
an I-premise
eye I-premise
on I-premise
good I-premise
and I-premise
products I-premise
, I-premise
calculate I-premise
prices I-premise
correctly I-premise
and I-premise
take I-premise
responsibilities I-premise
for I-premise
any I-premise
lost I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
children B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
material I-claim
, I-claim
neglect I-claim
their I-claim
study I-claim
for I-claim
earning I-claim
money I-claim
or I-claim
be I-claim
exploited I-claim
by I-claim
the I-claim
employers I-claim
. O

However O
, O
if B-premise
children I-premise
get I-premise
good I-premise
care I-premise
and I-premise
instructions I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
take I-premise
advantages I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
valuable I-premise
things I-premise
and I-premise
avoid I-premise
going I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
wrong I-premise
way I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
if B-claim
children I-claim
take I-claim
part I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
kind I-claim
of I-claim
paid I-claim
work I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
' I-claim
permission I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
lively I-claim
lessons I-claim
and I-claim
become I-claim
mature I-claim
and I-claim
responsible I-claim
. O

I O
recommend O
that O
parents O
should O
help O
their O
children O
to O
choose O
a O
suitable O
job O
which O
does O
not O
affect O
their O
children O
's O
study O
and O
that O
the O
government O
should O
have O
right O
policies O
to O
avoid O
exploiting O
children O
's O
labour O
. O

Jury O
must O
have O
access O
to O
criminals O
' O
past O
records O
Courts O
of O
many O
countries O
provide O
a O
jury O
with O
the O
history O
of O
a O
defendant O
, O
except O
those O
of O
the O
UK O
and O
Australia O
. O

Common O
belief O
that O
a O
jury O
should O
obtain O
all O
information O
regarding O
a O
suspect O
has O
fostered O
some O
lawyers O
to O
protest O
against O
the O
current O
rules O
in O
those O
two O
countries O
. O

Many O
people O
hold O
the O
opinion O
that O
past B-claim
behaviour I-claim
determines I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
actions I-claim
, O
which O
could O
be O
the O
main O
reason O
to O
support O
the O
idea O
of O
revealing O
the O
record O
to O
the O
jury O
. O

We O
must O
acknowledge O
that O
complete B-premise
data I-premise
concerning I-premise
the I-premise
history I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
sued I-premise
person I-premise
creates I-premise
more I-premise
opportunity I-premise
for I-premise
jury I-premise
members I-premise
to I-premise
build I-premise
an I-premise
overall I-premise
picture I-premise
of I-premise
defendant I-premise
's I-premise
personality I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
past B-premise
record I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
useful I-premise
to I-premise
decide I-premise
whether I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
was I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
perform I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
type I-premise
of I-premise
crime I-premise
when I-premise
it I-premise
concerns I-premise
serious I-premise
crimes I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
kidnapping I-premise
or I-premise
a I-premise
murder I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
in B-claim
order I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
jury I-claim
to I-claim
come I-claim
up I-claim
with I-claim
an I-claim
objective I-claim
decision I-claim
not I-claim
depending I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
past I-claim
experience I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
court I-claim
should I-claim
provide I-claim
with I-claim
details I-claim
relevant I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
particular I-claim
case I-claim
only I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a B-premise
defendant I-premise
with I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
past I-premise
crimes I-premise
has I-premise
more I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
found I-premise
guilty I-premise
compared I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
with I-premise
no I-premise
or I-premise
lighter I-premise
criminal I-premise
record I-premise
. O

Innocent B-premise
suspects I-premise
, I-premise
eventually I-premise
, I-premise
can I-premise
face I-premise
unfair I-premise
juridical I-premise
decision I-premise
and I-premise
pay I-premise
twice I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
previous I-premise
inadequate I-premise
actions I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I B-claim
am I-claim
skeptical I-claim
about I-claim
disclosing I-claim
the I-claim
defendant I-claim
's I-claim
history I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
jury I-claim
, I-claim
with I-claim
intention I-claim
to I-claim
avoid I-claim
subjective I-claim
and I-claim
probable I-claim
inaccurate I-claim
verdict I-claim
. O

Thus O
, O
I B-claim
strongly I-claim
support I-claim
the I-claim
current I-claim
laws I-claim
of I-claim
Great I-claim
Britain I-claim
and I-claim
Australia I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
would I-claim
not I-claim
change I-claim
the I-claim
regulations I-claim
on I-claim
keeping I-claim
the I-claim
jury I-claim
unaware I-claim
of I-claim
past I-claim
actions I-claim
. O

Over O

Consequently O

the O

an O

Personally O

I O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
Internet I-claim
will I-claim
pave I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
accessible I-claim

convenient I-claim

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
the B-claim
Internet I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
adequate I-claim
source I-claim
of I-claim
academic I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
will I-claim
potentially I-claim

the I-claim

Nowadays B-premise

As O

the B-premise

Last O

the B-premise

In O

Critics O

the I-premise
Internet I-premise
itself I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
what B-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
change I-premise
in I-premise
learners I-premise

attitude I-premise

an I-premise
elimination I-premise
of I-premise

After O
analyzing O
both O

of O

, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
like I-claim
to I-claim
reiterate I-claim
the I-claim

It O
is O

Early O
retirement O
for O
55 O

people O

Nowadays O
the O
discussion O
about O
whether O
the O
businesses O
are O
supposed O
to O
prescribe O
the O
retirement O
age O
at O
fifty O
- O
five O
to O
offer O
more O
job O
vacancies O
for O
younger O
generation O
has O
become O
a O
controversy O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
is O
a O
perfect O
attempt O
to O
support O
the O
young O
, O
others O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
encouraging B-claim
the I-claim
workers I-claim
to I-claim
retire I-claim
at I-claim
age I-claim
of I-claim
fifty I-claim
- I-claim
five I-claim
to I-claim
release I-claim
the I-claim
positions I-claim
for I-claim
younger I-claim
job I-claim
seekers I-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
merits I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
fresh B-premise
graduates I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
bring I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
practical I-premise
and I-premise
applicable I-premise
ideas I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
the I-premise
current I-premise
needs I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
organisation I-premise
. O

This O
is O
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
instilled I-premise
and I-premise
imparted I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
updated I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
skills I-premise
at I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
having B-premise
a I-premise
larger I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
young I-premise
adults I-premise
could I-premise
enhance I-premise
the I-premise
working I-premise
effectiveness I-premise
and I-premise
efficiency I-premise
. O

Compared B-premise
with I-premise
aged I-premise
staffs I-premise
, I-premise
younger I-premise
employees I-premise
are I-premise
often I-premise
physically I-premise
stronger I-premise
and I-premise
energetic I-premise
which I-premise
enables I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
carry I-premise
out I-premise
heavy I-premise
workload I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
the I-premise
deadline I-premise
. O

However O
, O
sacrificing B-claim
the I-claim
senior I-claim
members I-claim
to I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
workers I-claim
poses I-claim
several I-claim
negative I-claim
influences I-claim
. O

From B-premise
personal I-premise
level I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
fosters I-premise
a I-premise
sense I-premise
of I-premise
unfairness I-premise
between I-premise
the I-premise
older I-premise
and I-premise
younger I-premise
generations I-premise
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
every B-premise
person I-premise
within I-premise
the I-premise
business I-premise
enterprise I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
rights I-premise
to I-premise
proceed I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
as I-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
capable I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
it I-premise
, I-premise
disregard I-premise
the I-premise
age I-premise
and I-premise
physical I-premise
capacity I-premise
. O

From B-premise
social I-premise
perspective I-premise
, I-premise
massively I-premise
forcing I-premise
the I-premise
early I-premise
retirement I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
financial I-premise
burden I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
government I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
sufficient B-premise
pension I-premise
payments I-premise
and I-premise
regular I-premise
medical I-premise
care I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
given I-premise
and I-premise
arranged I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
senior I-premise
citizens I-premise
after I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
imposed I-premise
to I-premise
terminate I-premise
their I-premise
employment I-premise
permanently I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
even O
though O
the B-claim
introduction I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
early I-claim
retirement I-claim
has I-claim
some I-claim
benefits I-claim
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
it B-claim
would I-claim
generate I-claim
a I-claim
sense I-claim
of I-claim
discrimination I-claim
among I-claim
different I-claim
age I-claim
groups I-claim
and I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
financial I-claim
pressure I-claim
accordingly I-claim
. O

Can O
technology O
alone O
solve O
the O
world O
's O
environmental O
problems O
? O

It O
is O
irrefutable O
that O
progress O
in O
technology O
leads O
to O
environmental O
problems O
. O

Some O
individuals O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
if O
people O
live O
a O
simple O
life O
and O
do O
not O
use O
the O
things O
that O
technology O
has O
brought O
us O
then O
these O
problems O
can O
be O
solved O
whereas O
others O
opine O
that O
only O
technology O
can O
solve O
these O
problems O
. O

In O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
, O
I O
intend O
to O
discuss O
both O
viewpoints O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
that O
if B-claim
humans I-claim
stop I-claim
using I-claim
technology I-claim
and I-claim
lead I-claim
a I-claim
simple I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
then I-claim
only I-claim
we I-claim
can I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

They O
argue O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
luxuries I-premise
people I-premise
use I-premise
which I-premise
damages I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
use I-premise
air I-premise

, I-premise
automobiles I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
such I-premise
things I-premise
that I-premise
technology I-premise
has I-premise
brought I-premise
us I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
naturally I-premise
there I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
less I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
natural I-premise
resources I-premise
like I-premise
fossil I-premise
fuels I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
saved I-premise
and I-premise
all I-premise
this I-premise
would I-premise
save I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
there O
are O
people O
who O
say O
that O
technology B-claim
alone I-claim
could I-claim
save I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

They O
opine O
that O
now B-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
come I-premise
so I-premise
far I-premise
ahead I-premise
in I-premise
technology I-premise
that I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
going I-premise
back I-premise

We B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
ask I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
jet I-premise
age I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
back I-premise

There B-claim
are I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim

advances I-claim
going I-claim
on I-claim
technology I-claim
which I-claim
are I-claim
helping I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
. O

One B-premise
prime I-premise
example I-premise
is I-premise
finding I-premise
solutions I-premise
to I-premise
water I-premise
problems I-premise
in I-premise
developing I-premise

By B-premise
drawing I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
colossal I-premise
energy I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise

it I-premise

world I-premise

electricity I-premise
requirements I-premise
indefinitely I-premise
without I-premise
nuclear I-premise

. O

If B-premise
successful I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
impact I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
monumental I-premise

It B-premise
would I-premise
mean I-premise
energy I-premise
for I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
hospitals I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
homes I-premise
. O

It B-premise
would I-premise
mean I-premise
another I-premise
industrial I-premise
revolution I-premise
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
pen O
down O
saying O
that O
, O
technology B-claim
alone I-claim
can I-claim
solve I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
's I-claim
environmental I-claim
problems I-claim
. O

We O
are O
finally O
entering O
an O
era O
where O
engineering O
and O
technology O
are O
making O
the O
world O
a O
better O
place O
. O

It O
would O
be O
highly O
unpractical O
to O
ask O
people O
to O
adopt O
a O
simpler O
way O
of O
life O
. O

Computers O
replace O
human O
teachers O
With O
the O
number O
of O
technological O
advances O
growing O
apace O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
Internet O
and O
computers O
will O
supplant O
the O
traditional O
role O
of O
teachers O
in O
a O
not O
too O
distant O
future O
. O

This O
idea O
may O
point O
out O
to O
two O
main O
directions O
, O
both O
of O
which O
present O
different O
arguments O
. O

Central O
to O
the O
supporting O
arguments O
of O
this O
issue O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
the B-claim
global I-claim
online I-claim
network I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
inexhaustible I-claim
source I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
definitely I-claim
exceeds I-claim
the I-claim
fund I-claim
of I-claim
knowledge I-claim
that I-claim
any I-claim
veteran I-claim
teacher I-claim
can I-claim
accumulate I-claim
. O

Internet B-premise
and I-premise
computer I-premise
also I-premise
offer I-premise
a I-premise
more I-premise
comprehensive I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
ranging I-premise
from I-premise
visual I-premise
to I-premise
aural I-premise
stimuli I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
make I-premise
learning I-premise
an I-premise
ever I-premise
enjoyable I-premise
experience I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
critics O
of O
this O
idea O
maintain O
that O
although O
the O
educational O
benefits O
that O
the O
Internet O
may O
yield O
are O
undeniable O
, O
there O
still O
remain O
certain O
shortcomings O
. O

Much B-premise
information I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
Internet I-premise
may I-premise
provide I-premise
, I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
sources I-premise
are I-premise
unjustified I-premise
by I-premise
experts I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
information B-claim
from I-claim
those I-claim
sources I-claim
is I-claim
subject I-claim
to I-claim
question I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the B-premise
computer I-premise
can I-premise
show I-premise
whether I-premise
an I-premise
answer I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
particular I-premise
question I-premise
is I-premise
right I-premise
or I-premise
wrong I-premise
but O
it B-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
give I-claim
as I-claim
an I-claim
in I-claim
- I-claim
depth I-claim
explanation I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
human I-claim
teacher I-claim
can I-claim
. O

Through B-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
communication I-premise
, I-premise
teachers I-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
pinpoint I-premise
the I-premise
weaknesses I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
student I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
, I-premise
adjusting I-premise
and I-premise
tailoring I-premise
his I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
teaching I-premise
methodology I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
the I-premise
levels I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
demands I-premise
of I-premise
those I-premise
students I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
where I-premise
the I-premise
computer I-premise
proves I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
incompetent I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
although O
both O
sides O
have O
their O
equally O
valid O
arguments O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
although O
Internet B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
useful I-claim
tool I-claim
for I-claim
education I-claim
, O
at B-claim
no I-claim
time I-claim
will I-claim
the I-claim
unique I-claim
role I-claim
of I-claim
human I-claim
teachers I-claim
be I-claim
replaced I-claim
. O

One O
or O
two O
close O
friends O
vs. O
a O
large O
number O
of O
casual O
acquaintances O

There O
is O
no O
need O
for O
me O
to O
put O
any O
emphasis O
on O
the O
advantage O
of O
having O
a O
large O
number O
of O
casual O
acquaintance O
. O

However O
, O
I O
still O
agree O
that O
it B-claim
's I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
one I-claim
or I-claim
two I-claim
close I-claim
friends I-claim
than I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
casual I-claim
acquaintances I-claim
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
that O
being B-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
with I-premise
someone I-premise
is I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
only I-premise
being I-premise
acquaintant I-premise
. O

First O
, O
it B-premise
's I-premise
not I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
friend I-premise
with I-premise
anyone I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
friends B-premise
are I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
great I-premise
compatibility I-premise
with I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
. O

After B-premise
two I-premise
years I-premise
in I-premise
college I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
found I-premise
sometimes I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
differences I-premise
between I-premise
people I-premise
than I-premise
similarities I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
growing I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
different I-premise
families I-premise
and I-premise
was I-premise
educated I-premise
in I-premise
various I-premise
ways I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
acquaintances I-premise
are I-premise
just I-premise
acquaintances I-premise
. O

We B-premise
spend I-premise
time I-premise
together I-premise
but I-premise
we I-premise
could I-premise
never I-premise
be I-premise
friend I-premise
. O

So O
, O
it B-claim
's I-claim
much I-claim
easier I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
casual I-claim
acquaintances I-claim
than I-claim
have I-claim
some I-claim
close I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
close B-claim
friends I-claim
can I-claim
easily I-claim
understand I-claim
each I-claim
others I-claim
feelings I-claim
. O

Because O
of O
the O
similarity O
I O
talked O
before O
, O
acquaintances B-premise
probably I-premise
not I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
you I-premise
better I-premise
than I-premise
your I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
even I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
your I-premise
feelings I-premise
. O

Everyone B-premise
play I-premise
the I-premise
role I-premise
of I-premise
acquaintance I-premise
and I-premise
friend I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Being B-premise
friendly I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
treat I-premise
a I-premise
acquaintance I-premise
but I-premise
way I-premise
not I-premise
enough I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
. O

When B-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
is I-premise
sick I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
ask I-premise
if I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
okay I-premise
like I-premise
an I-premise
acquaintance I-premise
but I-premise
do I-premise
my I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
him I-premise
get I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
soon I-premise
as I-premise
possible I-premise
. O

If B-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
is I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
wrong I-premise
direction I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
life I-premise
trail I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
will I-premise
try I-premise
my I-premise
best I-premise
to I-premise
pull I-premise
him I-premise
back I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
not I-premise
stand I-premise
and I-premise
stare I-premise
like I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
not I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
business I-premise
. O

And O
I O
believe O
my B-premise
friend I-premise
will I-premise
do I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
to I-premise
me I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a B-claim
friend I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
you I-claim
care I-claim
about I-claim
. O

To O
me O
, O
friends B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
people I-claim
in I-claim
my I-claim
life I-claim
second I-claim
to I-claim
my I-claim
family I-claim
. O

I O
am O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
has O
only O
one O
or O
two O
close O
friends O
, O
and O
I O
am O
fully O
content O
that O
I O
have O
such O
nice O
friends O
. O

If O
someone O
exchange O
my O
friends O
with O
thousands O
of O
acquaintances O
, O
I O
will O
definitely O
say O
NO O
. O

Living O
in O
a O
higher O
pace O
is O
better O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
people O

and O
this O
topic O
can O
also O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
be O
hurry O
to O
complete O
their O
tasks O
, O
while O
others O
seem O
to O
prefer O
the O
opposite O
position O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
also O
develop O
my O
own O
perspective O
. O

I O
favor O
the O
former O
; O
that O
is O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
higher I-claim
pace I-claim
condition I-claim
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
we B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
save I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
accomplishing I-premise
some I-premise
important I-premise
tasks I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
fitting I-premise
example I-premise
of I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
found I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
experience I-premise
of I-premise
missing I-premise
exam I-premise
. O

I B-premise
just I-premise
failed I-premise
to I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
entrance I-premise
exam I-premise
because O
I B-premise
thought I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
enough I-premise
time I-premise
for I-premise
eating I-premise
breakfast I-premise
and I-premise
transporting I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
testing I-premise
place I-premise
; I-premise
while I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
stocked I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
traffic I-premise
jam I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
missed I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
test I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
start O
to O
agree O
that O
we B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
eager I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
another O
equally O
important O
aspect O
is O
keeping B-premise
in I-premise
high I-premise
pace I-premise
condition I-premise
can I-premise
prevent I-premise
me I-premise
from I-premise
getting I-premise
lazy I-premise
. O

If B-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
avoid I-premise
being I-premise
a I-premise
sluggish I-premise
person I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
higher I-premise
probability I-premise
of I-premise
fulfilling I-premise
my I-premise
dream I-premise
successfully I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
had I-premise
spent I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
practicing I-premise
playing I-premise
piano I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
won I-premise
a I-premise
piano I-premise
competition I-premise
, I-premise
defeating I-premise
those I-premise
spending I-premise
less I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
practicing I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
keeping B-claim
our I-claim
pace I-claim
higher I-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
people O
proclaiming O
that O
with B-claim
a I-claim
slower I-claim
pace I-claim
can I-claim
enjoy I-claim
their I-claim
lives I-claim
more I-claim
because O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
notice I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
control I-premise
or I-premise
acquire I-premise
the I-premise
fame I-premise
of I-premise
succeed I-premise
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
limited O
understanding O
, O
I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
. O

I B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
those I-premise
people I-premise
with I-premise
slower I-premise
pace I-premise
losing I-premise
the I-premise
piano I-premise
competition I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
really I-premise
happy I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
really I-premise
joyful I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
can I-premise
immerse I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
joy I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
victory I-premise
and I-premise
accomplishment I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrated O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
higher I-claim
pace I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
because O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
this I-claim
are I-claim
qualitatively I-claim
greater I-claim
than I-claim
that I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
opposite I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
high I-claim
pace I-claim
. O

It O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
of O
course O
that O
other O
points O
of O
view O
are O
totally O
without O
merit O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
am O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
reasons O
I O
proposed O
in O
favor O
of O
my O
own O
sentiment O
are O
much O
more O
tenable O
and O
plausible O
. O

Teachers O

The O
way O
in O

today O

relatively O
low O

Despite O
the O

some O
people O
that O
learners B-claim
can I-claim
obtain I-claim
more I-claim
useful I-claim
knowledge I-claim
from I-claim
teachers I-claim
than I-claim
from I-claim
other I-claim
sources I-claim
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
both B-claim
alternative I-claim
sources I-claim
and I-claim
traditional I-claim
teaching I-claim
methods I-claim
from I-claim
educators I-claim
are I-claim
equally I-claim
important I-claim
in I-claim
children I-claim
's I-claim
acquisition I-claim
of I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the B-premise
widespread I-premise
of I-premise
alternative I-premise
sources I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
has I-premise
played I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
role I-premise
in I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
acquisition I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

Computers B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
programmed I-premise
to I-premise
provide I-premise
an I-premise
endless I-premise
numbers I-premise
of I-premise
questions I-premise
in I-premise
diverse I-premise
range I-premise
of I-premise
fields I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
answer I-premise
these I-premise
questions I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
facts I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
learned I-premise
and I-premise
reinforced I-premise
. O

A B-premise
case I-premise
in I-premise
point I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
reading I-premise
and I-premise
listening I-premise
parts I-premise
of I-premise
TOEFL I-premise
iBT I-premise
exams I-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
candidates I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
answer I-premise
many I-premise
questions I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
limited I-premise
period I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
when B-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
some I-premise
academic I-premise
problems I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
post I-premise
those I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
websites I-premise
and I-premise
receive I-premise
correct I-premise
answers I-premise
from I-premise
unknown I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
faraway I-premise
places I-premise
without I-premise
any I-premise
costs I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
in B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
conducting I-premise
a I-premise
research I-premise
require I-premise
long I-premise
hours I-premise
of I-premise
searching I-premise
in I-premise
library I-premise
shelves I-premise
, I-premise
now I-premise
all I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
done I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
click I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
button I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
technologies B-claim
are I-claim
vital I-claim
in I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
schools B-premise
and I-premise
university I-premise
are I-premise
places I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
students I-premise
gather I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
educated I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
from I-premise
each I-premise
others I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
formal I-premise
educators I-premise
. O

At B-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
development I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
orchestrated I-premise
stage I-premise
by I-premise
stage I-premise
, I-premise
step I-premise
by I-premise
step I-premise
by I-premise
experienced I-premise
teachers I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
acquisition I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
is I-premise
guided I-premise
and I-premise
backed I-premise
up I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
systematic I-premise
way I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
formal B-claim
education I-claim
approaches I-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
indispensable I-claim
. O

To O
put O
it O
all O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
pen O
out O
saying O
that O
alternative B-claim
sources I-claim

traditional I-claim
education I-claim
systems I-claim
are I-claim
equally I-claim
important I-claim
in I-claim

So O
students O
should O
learn O
both O
from O

gain O
the O

Protect O
animals O
or O
not O
? O

Many O
animals O
today O
are O
in O
danger O
of O
extinction O
owing O
to O
various O
reasons O
. O

While O
some O
people O
believe O
it O
is O
important O
to O
protect O
these O
endangered O
species O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
problems O
of O
human O
beings O
deserve O
more O
attention O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we B-claim
should I-claim
give I-claim
priority I-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
issues I-claim
. O

Animal O
protectionists O
may O
base O
their O
argument O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
biodiversity B-premise
is I-premise
essential I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
the I-premise
balance I-premise
of I-premise
ecosystem I-premise
. O

If B-premise
certain I-premise
species I-premise
are I-premise
absent I-premise
from I-premise
this I-premise
system I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
balance I-premise
is I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
disrupted I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
species I-premise
, I-premise
including I-premise
human I-premise
beings I-premise
, I-premise
will I-premise
come I-premise
under I-premise
threat I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
our I-claim
responsibility I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
as I-claim
many I-claim
species I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
Earth I-claim
as I-claim
possible I-claim
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
species B-claim
extinction I-claim
is I-claim
quite I-claim
natural I-claim
according I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
theory I-claim
of I-claim
evolution I-claim
. O

The B-premise
environment I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
Earth I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
transformed I-premise
many I-premise
times I-premise
since I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
species I-premise
came I-premise
into I-premise
being I-premise
. O

A B-premise
great I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
plants I-premise
and I-premise
animals I-premise
died I-premise
out I-premise
because O
they B-premise
were I-premise
unable I-premise
to I-premise
fit I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
new I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

On O
most O
occasions O
, O
the B-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
extinction I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
species I-premise
is I-premise
irrevocable I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
nothing I-premise
about I-premise
it I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
human B-premise
beings I-premise
nowadays I-premise
are I-premise
still I-premise
faced I-premise
with I-premise
many I-premise
urgent I-premise
problems I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
starvation I-premise
, I-premise
disease I-premise
and I-premise
wars I-premise
. O

When B-premise
these I-premise
problems I-premise
are I-premise
taken I-premise
into I-premise
account I-premise
, I-premise
extinction I-premise
of I-premise
some I-premise
animals I-premise
recedes I-premise
greatly I-premise
in I-premise
importance I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
sensible I-premise
to I-premise
devote I-premise
our I-premise
limited I-premise
resources I-premise
to I-premise
animals I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
past I-premise
help I-premise
. O

We B-claim
should I-claim
put I-claim
our I-claim
own I-claim
survival I-claim
and I-claim
sustainment I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
first I-claim
before I-claim
considering I-claim
the I-claim
conservation I-claim
of I-claim
other I-claim
species I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
more B-claim
emphasis I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
laid I-claim
on I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
other I-claim
than I-claim
animals I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
let I-claim
nature I-claim
take I-claim
its I-claim
course I-claim
with I-claim
regard I-claim
to I-claim
species I-claim

Although O
the B-claim

some I-claim
pressure I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim

I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
advanced I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
brings I-claim
with I-claim
it I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim

. O

The B-claim
main I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
high I-claim
- I-claim
tech I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
is I-claim
that I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
better I-claim
taken I-claim
care I-claim
so I-claim
that I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
health I-claim
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
contribute I-premise
effectively I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
economy I-premise
because O
healthy B-premise
workers I-premise
can I-premise
create I-premise
more I-premise
productivity I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
they B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
more I-premise
time I-premise
in I-premise
health I-premise
checking I-premise
or I-premise
treatment I-premise
so O
this B-premise
saves I-premise
an I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
as I-premise
cost I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-premise
community I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
elderly I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
health I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
major I-premise
role I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
sustainable I-premise
development I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
society I-premise
. O

In O
facts O
, O
young B-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
happy I-premise
as I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
, I-premise
grandparents I-premise
are I-premise
healthy I-premise
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the B-claim
improvement I-claim
of I-claim
medical I-claim
care I-claim
makes I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
life I-claim
for I-claim
all I-claim
people I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O
people O
maintain O
that O
the B-claim
increase I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
expectancy I-claim
puts I-claim
a I-claim
high I-claim
pressure I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
economic I-claim
system I-claim
because O
more B-premise
pension I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
for I-premise
Medicare I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
investing I-premise
in I-premise
other I-premise
sectors I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
economic I-premise
system I-premise
. O

Although O
it O
is O
real O
in O
some O
aspects O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the B-premise
capital I-premise
that I-premise
spend I-premise
on I-premise
taking I-premise
care I-premise
the I-premise
elderly I-premise
is I-premise
contributed I-premise
by I-premise
these I-premise
people I-premise
during I-premise
their I-premise
working I-premise
time I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
are I-premise
worth I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
good I-premise
care I-premise
. O

They B-premise
have I-premise
given I-premise
their I-premise
effort I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
governments I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
responsibility I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
the I-premise
Medicare I-premise
system I-premise
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the B-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
health I-claim

system I-claim
helps I-claim
people I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim

It B-claim
helps I-claim
people I-claim
build I-claim
a I-claim
sustainable I-claim

where I-claim

which O

the O

open O

more I-claim
easily I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim

I O
agree O

In O
my O
opinion O

plays I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim

role I-claim

helping I-claim

There O
are O
a O

First O
of O
all O

more B-premise

I O

concerned O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim

This O

If B-premise

This O

Apart O
from O
saving O
a O
lot O
of O

, O
living B-claim

a I-claim
roommate I-claim
also I-claim
enables I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
socialize I-claim
more I-claim
easily I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
always I-premise
easier I-premise
to I-premise
socialize I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise

people I-premise
around I-premise

You B-premise

your I-premise

For O

one B-premise
night I-premise

my I-premise
roommate I-premise

Millan I-premise

brought I-premise
his I-premise

I I-premise
were I-premise
total I-premise
strangers I-premise

each I-premise

We B-premise
soon I-premise

out I-premise

We B-premise
played I-premise
a I-premise

Halo I-premise

together I-premise
all I-premise
night I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
became I-premise
good I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Living B-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
roommate I-premise
made I-premise
socializing I-premise
much I-premise
easier I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
living B-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
roommate I-claim
allows I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
help I-claim
. O

It B-premise
often I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
case I-premise
that I-premise
your I-premise
roommates I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
skills I-premise
or I-premise
knowledge I-premise
you I-premise
need I-premise
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
run I-premise
into I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
ask I-premise
your I-premise
roommates I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
. O

Some B-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
may I-premise
have I-premise
something I-premise
to I-premise
offer I-premise
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
when B-premise
my I-premise
computer I-premise
mysteriously I-premise
broke I-premise
down I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
dialed I-premise
up I-premise
the I-premise
manufacturer I-premise
and I-premise
asked I-premise
for I-premise
help I-premise
. O

They B-premise
failed I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
me I-premise
any I-premise
useful I-premise
solutions I-premise
. O

To B-premise
my I-premise
surprise I-premise
, I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
roommates I-premise
noticed I-premise
my I-premise
problems I-premise
and I-premise
offered I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
. O

He B-premise
was I-premise
very I-premise
good I-premise
with I-premise
computers I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
he I-premise
managed I-premise
to I-premise
fix I-premise
the I-premise
problem I-premise
quickly I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
while O
many B-claim
people I-claim
decide I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
alone I-claim
for I-claim
various I-claim
reasons I-claim
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
roommate I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
I I-claim
always I-claim
will I-claim
. O

This O
is O
because O
it B-claim
offers I-claim
me I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
, I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
less I-claim
spending I-claim
, I-claim
more I-claim
socializing I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
help I-claim
. O

I O
think O
single O
people O
should O
live O
with O
a O
roommate O
, O
if O
they O
want O
to O
enjoy O
their O
lives O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
there O
should O
be O
fixed O
punishment O
for O
each O
crime O
type O
Generally O
reason O
behind O
punishment O
is O
to O
reduce O
the O
crime O
from O
a O
nation O
and O
to O
build O
a O
fear O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
offenders O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
what O
is O
reason O
behind O
committing O
a O
crime O
therefore O
there O
should O
be O
fixed O
punishment O
for O
a O
specific O
crime O
. O

Alternatively O
I O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
should I-claim
taken I-claim
into I-claim
consideration I-claim
the I-claim
situation I-claim
and I-claim
conditions I-claim
, I-claim
that I-claim
forces I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
criminal I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
if B-claim
there I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
fixed I-claim
punishment I-claim
for I-claim
each I-claim
type I-claim
of I-claim
crime I-claim
then I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
the I-claim
crime I-claim
because O
the B-premise
punishment I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
clear I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
mind I-premise
of I-premise
professional I-premise
criminals I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
feel I-premise
fear I-premise
while I-premise
committing I-premise
a I-premise
crime I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
laws B-premise
and I-premise
rules I-premise
are I-premise
there I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise

therefore O
it B-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
look I-claim
behind I-claim
crime I-claim
for O
instance O

" O
a B-premise
women I-premise
steals I-premise
feed I-premise
for I-premise
her I-premise
child I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
treated I-premise
same I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
women I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
steals I-premise
for I-premise
her I-premise
drug I-premise
addiction I-premise
" O
. O

The B-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
committed I-premise
crime I-premise
first I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
professional I-premise
criminals I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
imprisoned I-premise
at I-premise
same I-premise
place I-premise
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
fixed B-claim
punishment I-claim
will I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
taken I-claim
by I-claim
judges I-claim
to I-claim
give I-claim
their I-claim
judgement I-claim
and I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
effective I-claim
economically I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
Government I-claim
. O

Everyone B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
treated I-premise
equally I-premise
because O
sometimes B-premise
we I-premise
see I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
poor I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
much I-premise
money I-premise
for I-premise
hiring I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
lawyer I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
imprisoned I-premise
even I-premise
without I-premise
committing I-premise
a I-premise
crime I-premise

and I-premise
when I-premise
they I-premise
come I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
they I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
professional I-premise
criminal I-premise
. O

Therefore O
fixed B-claim
punishment I-claim
will I-claim
reduce I-claim
the I-claim
space I-claim
between I-claim
poor I-claim
and I-claim
rich I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
everyone I-claim
will I-claim
understand I-claim
the I-claim
importance I-claim
of I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
Government B-claim
should I-claim
decide I-claim
for I-claim
punishment I-claim
case I-claim
by I-claim
case I-claim
basis I-claim
. O

In O
doing O
so O
crime O
can O
be O
eliminated O
from O
a O
nation O
and O
it O
is O
a O
responsibility O
of O
every O
individual O
to O
be O
in O
the O
favor O
of O
truth O
and O
respect O
the O
laws O
of O
our O
constitution O
. O

A O
more O
convenient O
life O
in O
a O
city O

There O
are O
undeniable O
advantages O
to O
both O
life O
in O
a O
big O
city O
and O
in O
a O
small O
town O
. O

The O
former O
offers O
more O
excitement O
and O
convenience O
while O
the O
latter O
offers O
a O
cleaner O
, O
quieter O
and O
often O
friendlier O
place O
to O
live O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
advantages O
of O
small O
town O
life O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
I B-claim
have I-claim
always I-claim
wanted I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
company I-claim
which I-claim
locates I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
prosperous I-claim
city I-claim
area I-claim
. O

To O
make O
it O
convenient O
, O
I B-premise
will I-premise
absolutely I-premise
choose I-premise
a I-premise
place I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
that I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
too I-premise
far I-premise
from I-premise
my I-premise
workplace I-premise
. O

What O
's O
more O
I B-premise
can I-premise
save I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
transportation I-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
life B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
so I-claim
dull I-claim
as I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
small I-claim
town I-claim
. O

You B-premise
can I-premise
enjoy I-premise
modern I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
advanced I-premise
facilities I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you B-premise
can I-premise
visit I-premise
museums I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
history I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
more I-premise
equipped I-premise
library I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
reading I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
sports I-premise
center I-premise
for I-premise
exercising I-premise
. O

But O
a B-premise
small I-premise
town I-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
less I-premise
developed I-premise
to I-premise
satisfy I-premise
all I-premise
these I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
needs I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
living B-claim
in I-claim
big I-claim
cities I-claim
means I-claim
more I-claim
exposure I-claim
to I-claim
stimulation I-claim
, I-claim
like I-claim
all I-claim
kinds I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
. O

If B-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
efficiently I-premise
acquire I-premise
the I-premise
information I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
might I-premise
come I-premise
along I-premise
more I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
his I-premise
goals I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
various I-premise
advertisements I-premise
here I-premise

an I-premise
there I-premise
, I-premise
whether I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
leaflets I-premise
or I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
big I-premise
screen I-premise
showing I-premise
things I-premise
of I-premise
all I-premise
sorts I-premise
in I-premise
commercial I-premise
zones I-premise
. O

If B-premise
one I-premise
is I-premise
seeking I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
right I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
or I-premise
planing I-premise
somewhere I-premise
to I-premise
travel I-premise

or I-premise
just I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
buy I-premise
a I-premise
product I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dependable I-premise
store I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
might I-premise
refer I-premise
to I-premise
what I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
seen I-premise
or I-premise
heard I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
advertisements I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
relatively I-premise
wise I-premise
choice I-premise
. O

There B-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
another I-claim
obvious I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
city I-claim
considering I-claim
the I-claim
chance I-claim
of I-claim
receiving I-claim
better I-claim
education I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
offspring I-claim
. O

Schools B-premise
in I-premise
big I-premise
cities I-premise
may I-premise
receive I-premise
more I-premise
funds I-premise
from I-premise
whether I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
comities I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise

make I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
equipped I-premise
with I-premise
advanced I-premise
teaching I-premise
facilities I-premise
and I-premise
attract I-premise
more I-premise
excellent I-premise
teachers I-premise

Our B-premise
children I-premise
thus I-premise

have I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
chance I-premise

pursuing I-premise

In O
conclusion O
, O
if B-claim
I I-claim

to I-claim
live I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim

The O
precondition O
of O
doing O
research O
by O
professors O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
professors O
conduct O
research O
while O
teaching O
in O
colleges O
or O
universities O
. O

Although O
research B-premise
could I-premise
bring I-premise
funding I-premise
and I-premise
latest I-premise
achievements I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
field I-premise
, O
the B-claim
research I-claim
takes I-claim
up I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
teaching I-claim
time I-claim
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
professors B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
on I-claim
preparing I-claim
courses I-claim
than I-claim
research I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
vital O
that O
professors B-premise
should I-premise
assist I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
knowledge I-premise
. O

The B-premise
professors I-premise
’ I-premise
duty I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
nurture I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
prepare I-premise
excellent I-premise
courses I-premise
. O

If B-premise
professors I-premise
spend I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
will I-premise
cut I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
on I-premise
preparing I-premise
courses I-premise

is I-premise
reduced I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
may I-premise
decrease I-premise
the I-premise
quality I-premise
of I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

The B-premise
reason I-premise
why I-premise
people I-premise
enter I-premise
a I-premise
university I-premise
is I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
cutting I-premise
- I-premise
edged I-premise
technologies I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
professors B-premise
should I-premise
provide I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
preparation I-premise
courses I-premise
to I-premise
convey I-premise
the I-premise
state I-premise
- I-premise
of I-premise
- I-premise
art I-premise
knowledge I-premise
for I-premise
college I-premise
and I-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
professors B-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
more I-claim
attention I-claim
on I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
teach I-claim
students I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
conduct I-claim
research I-claim
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if B-premise
professors I-premise
are I-premise
busy I-premise
in I-premise
doing I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
ignoring I-premise
preparing I-premise
appropriate I-premise
courses I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
ruin I-premise
the I-premise
reputation I-premise
of I-premise
universities I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
are I-premise
unsatisfied I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
unprepared I-premise
course I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
enrollment I-premise
of I-premise
universities I-premise
may I-premise
decline I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
students I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
choose I-premise
these I-premise
kinds I-premise
of I-premise
universities I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
hardly B-premise
can I-premise
professors I-premise
find I-premise
assistants I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
with I-premise
projects I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
adverse I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
academic I-premise
field I-premise
. O

Accordingly O
, O
spending B-claim
more I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
nurture I-claim
excellent I-claim
students I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
consequential I-claim
to I-claim
professors I-claim
, I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
research I-claim
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
professors B-claim
could I-claim
teach I-claim
students I-claim
through I-claim
research I-claim
and I-claim
projects I-claim
. O

Some B-premise
students I-premise
enjoy I-premise
taking I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
research I-premise
. O

Through B-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
equipment I-premise
and I-premise
invent I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
experience I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
process I-premise
of I-premise
research I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
electronic B-premise
students I-premise
always I-premise
invent I-premise
new I-premise
machines I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
robots I-premise
, I-premise
MP3 I-premise
and I-premise
remote I-premise
control I-premise
car I-premise
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
manage I-premise
the I-premise
electric I-premise
theory I-premise
in I-premise
practical I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

And B-premise
some I-premise
students I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
rewarded I-premise
by I-premise
investing I-premise
new I-premise
inventions I-premise
. O

However O
, O
only B-premise
under I-premise
specific I-premise
circumstance I-premise
, I-premise
when I-premise
students I-premise
master I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
systematic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
can I-premise
they I-premise
accomplish I-premise
research I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
requires I-premise
professors I-premise
provide I-premise
high I-premise
quality I-premise
courses I-premise
. O

In O
other O
word O
, O
professor B-claim
should I-claim
concern I-claim
about I-claim
preparing I-claim
class I-claim
. O

Consequently O
, O
conducting B-premise
research I-premise
is I-premise
helpful I-premise
for I-premise
professors I-premise
and I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
extent I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
precondition I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
research I-premise
is I-premise
growing I-premise
students I-premise
’ I-premise
solid I-premise
theory I-premise
fundamental I-premise
. O

Only B-claim
by I-claim
developing I-claim
students I-claim
, I-claim
can I-claim
we I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
academic I-claim
field I-claim
. O

Professors B-claim
could I-claim
combine I-claim
doing I-claim
research I-claim
and I-claim
preparing I-claim
good I-claim
courses I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
dynamic I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Apartments O
vs O
dormitories O
at O
university O
Many O
students O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
the O
university O
dormitories O
while O
others O
prefer O
an O
apartment O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Both O
options O
have O
their O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
. O

After O
considering O
the O
level O
of O
freedom O
, O
the O
studying O
conditions O
and O
the O
economic O
factor O
, O
if O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
apartment I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
community I-claim
rather I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
university I-claim
dormitories I-claim
. O

First O
, O
an B-claim
apartment I-claim
provides I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
more I-claim
freedom I-claim
than I-claim
a I-claim
dormitory I-claim
. O

While B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dormitory I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
obey I-premise
preset I-premise
rules I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
apartment I-premise
you I-premise
set I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise
rules I-premise
. O

You B-premise
are I-premise
free I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
visits I-premise
at I-premise
any I-premise
time I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
left I-premise
alone I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
. O

An B-premise
apartment I-premise
offers I-premise
more I-premise
privacy I-premise
because O
you B-premise
can I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise
room I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
sharing I-premise
with I-premise
another I-premise
student I-premise
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
factor O
because O
you B-premise
also I-premise
get I-premise
more I-premise
space I-premise
than I-premise
you I-premise
would I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dormitory I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
from O
an O
economic O
point O
of O
view O
, O
people O
often O
argue O
that O
an B-claim
apartment I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
expensive I-claim
. O

This O
is O
only O
partially O
true O
, O
you B-premise
could I-premise
rent I-premise
the I-premise
extra I-premise
rooms I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
apartment I-premise
to I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
rent I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
cheaper I-premise
. O

Transportation B-premise
is I-premise
another I-premise
issue I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
and I-premise
return I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise
everyday I-premise
. O

You B-premise
could I-premise
choose I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
cheaper I-premise
option I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
car I-premise
. O

The B-premise
car I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
expensive I-premise
option I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
offers I-premise
freedom I-premise
of I-premise
schedule I-premise
and I-premise
destination I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
the B-claim
studying I-claim
conditions I-claim
are I-claim
better I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
apartment I-claim
because O
you B-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
all I-premise
the I-premise
noise I-premise
and I-premise
distractions I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
often I-premise
have I-premise
in I-premise
dormitories I-premise
. O

A B-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
students I-premise
often I-premise
complain I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
roommate I-premise
playing I-premise
music I-premise
too I-premise
loud I-premise
or I-premise
bringing I-premise
friends I-premise
over I-premise
at I-premise
inappropriate I-premise
times I-premise
. O

Since O
in B-premise
an I-premise
apartment I-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
roommate I-premise
, O
you B-premise
wo I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
this I-premise
problem I-premise
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
you B-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
concentrate I-premise
better I-premise
. O

For O
the O
same O
reason O
, O
you B-premise
wo I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
if I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
music I-premise
, I-premise
bring I-premise
friends I-premise
over I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
study I-premise
late I-premise
at I-premise
night I-premise
. O

You B-premise
set I-premise
your I-premise
own I-premise
schedules I-premise
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
living B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
dormitory I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
being I-premise
surrounded I-premise
by I-premise
students I-premise
also I-premise
has I-premise
some I-premise
advantages I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
being I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
help I-premise
with I-premise
any I-premise
academic I-premise
issues I-premise
from I-premise
them I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
both O
options O
have O
their O
advantages O
, O
but O
personally O
I O
think O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
apartment I-claim
outshine I-claim
those I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
dormitory I-claim
. O

Why O
are O
groups O
or O
organizations O
important O
to O
people O
? O

During O
our O
life O
, O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
we O
may O
be O
related O
with O
any O
groups O
or O
organizations O
; O
therefore O
, O
groups O
and O
organizations O
are O
an O
important O
part O
of O
their O
lives O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
groups B-claim
provide I-claim
a I-claim
place I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
gain I-claim
experiences I-claim
or I-claim
achieve I-claim
goals I-claim
. O

My O
reasons O
include O
the O
following O
: O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
humans B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
society I-premise
includes I-premise
a I-premise
wide I-premise
variety I-premise
of I-premise
groups I-premise
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
the B-claim
groups I-claim
play I-claim
an I-claim
essential I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
process I-claim
of I-claim
socialization I-claim
, I-claim
from I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
adults I-claim
. O

We B-premise
begin I-premise
taking I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
groups I-premise
or I-premise
organizations I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
early I-premise
days I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
especially I-premise
most I-premise
people I-premise
continue I-premise
their I-premise
social I-premise
participation I-premise
in I-premise
all I-premise
through I-premise
life I-premise
. O

By B-premise
making I-premise
teamwork I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
in I-premise
schools I-premise
may I-premise
learn I-premise
to I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
along I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

As B-premise
university I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
likely I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
join I-premise
student I-premise
organization I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
major I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
expand I-premise
their I-premise
experiences I-premise
or I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
. O

After B-premise
graduating I-premise
from I-premise
schools I-premise
, I-premise
employees I-premise
might I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
business I-premise
associations I-premise
for I-premise
various I-premise
business I-premise
resources I-premise
and I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
almost B-claim
of I-claim
us I-claim
live I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
of I-claim
groups I-claim
. O

By B-claim
participating I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
organization I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
obtain I-claim
some I-claim
experiences I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
particular I-claim
purpose I-claim
. O

A B-premise
solid I-premise
group I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
suited I-premise
environment I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
provides I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
themselves I-premise
or I-premise
broaden I-premise
their I-premise
horizons I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
as B-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
majoring I-premise
in I-premise
mass I-premise
media I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
taken I-premise
part I-premise
in I-premise
mass I-premise
media I-premise
student I-premise
group I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
year I-premise
. O

When B-premise
being I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
department I-premise
of I-premise
art I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
learned I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
a I-premise
project I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
known I-premise
some I-premise
famous I-premise
artists I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
term I-premise
. O

Above O
all O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
advantage I-premise
which I-premise
increase I-premise
an I-premise
opportunity I-premise
on I-premise
my I-premise
resume I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
sake I-premise
of I-premise
getting I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
groups B-claim
and I-claim
organizations I-claim
would I-claim
lead I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
action I-claim
or I-claim
achieve I-claim
their I-claim
goal I-claim
. O

Here O

there B-premise
are I-premise
various I-premise
charities I-premise

They B-premise

. O

For B-premise
accomplishing I-premise
their I-premise

the I-premise

As O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O

examples O
, O
it O
could O
be O
widely O
thought O
that O
groups B-claim
or I-claim
organizations I-claim
are I-claim
a I-claim
vital I-claim
part I-claim
for I-claim
us I-claim
in I-claim
plenty I-claim
of I-claim
aspects I-claim
in I-claim
different I-claim
ages I-claim

in I-claim
different I-claim
backgrounds I-claim
. O

Should O
the O
Government O
Provide O
Free O
College O
? O

Some O
people O
believe O

the O

cover O
the O
college O

for O
any O
citizen O

a O
college O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
individuals B-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
their I-claim
college I-claim
tuition I-claim
because O
it B-claim
would I-claim
cost I-claim
too I-claim

the I-claim

there I-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
ways I-claim
to I-claim
fund I-claim
a I-claim
college I-claim
education I-claim
. O

First O
, O
making B-claim
college I-claim
education I-claim
free I-claim
would I-claim
cost I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
. O

It B-premise
would I-premise
divert I-premise
public I-premise
funds I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
needs I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
law I-premise
enforcement I-premise
, I-premise
infrastructure I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
forth I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
other I-premise
needs I-premise
which I-premise
should I-premise
come I-premise
first I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
providing I-premise
health I-premise
care I-premise
to I-premise
all I-premise
American I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
improving I-premise
public I-premise
schools I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it B-premise
would I-premise
cause I-premise
to I-premise
raise I-premise
our I-premise
taxes I-premise
again I-premise
and I-premise
again I-premise
to I-premise
fund I-premise
college I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
it B-premise
would I-premise
affect I-premise
all I-premise
taxpayers I-premise
whether I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
they I-premise
benefit I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
funds I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
personal I-premise
choice I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
college I-premise
. O

Not B-premise
everyone I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
college I-premise
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
life I-premise
than I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
decide I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
college I-premise
education I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
those B-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
make I-claim
the I-claim
financial I-claim
investment I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
choice I-claim
; I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
. O

Third O
, O
there B-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
ways I-claim
to I-claim
fund I-claim
a I-claim
college I-claim
education I-claim
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
afford I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
their I-premise
tuition I-premise
benefit I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
scholarship I-premise
, I-premise
financial I-premise
aids I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
funds I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
government I-premise
already I-premise
helps I-premise
pay I-premise
college I-premise
expense I-premise
through I-premise
indirect I-premise
means I-premise
. O

They B-premise
often I-premise
provide I-premise
services I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
fire I-premise
departments I-premise
, I-premise
medical I-premise
assistance I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
police I-premise
protection I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
schools I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
. O

They B-premise
also I-premise
provide I-premise
funds I-premise
for I-premise
academic I-premise
research I-premise
. O

While B-premise
the I-premise
money I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
given I-premise
to I-premise
individual I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
contributions I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
trivial I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
the B-claim
individual I-claim
should I-claim
finance I-claim
his I-claim
or I-claim
her I-claim
education I-claim
because O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
personal I-claim
choice I-claim
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
cause I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
cost I-claim
from I-claim
taxpayers I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
government O
. O

Where O
to O
learn O
a O
new O
language O
? O

Although O
there O
are O
some O
advantages O
to O
learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
in O
its O
original O
country O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
people B-claim
who I-claim
learn I-claim
a I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
country I-claim
in I-claim
which I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
spoken I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
deeper I-claim
understanding I-claim
of I-claim
different I-claim
language I-claim
skills I-claim
than I-claim
those I-claim
who I-claim
learn I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
languages I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
countries I-claim
. O

Person B-claim
' I-claim
A I-claim
' I-claim
who I-claim
learns I-claim
a I-claim
non I-claim
- I-claim
native I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
his I-claim
country I-claim
may I-claim
receive I-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
a I-claim
step I-claim
- I-claim
by I-claim
- I-claim
step I-claim
teaching I-claim
method I-claim
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
he B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
jumping I-premise
into I-premise
the I-premise
foreign I-premise
country I-premise
. O

Therefore O
he B-premise
can I-premise
set I-premise
aside I-premise
enough I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
energy I-premise
dedicated I-premise
to I-premise
learning I-premise
the I-premise
language I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
all B-premise
the I-premise
learners I-premise
are I-premise
probably I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
country I-premise
, O
so O
all B-premise
these I-premise
people I-premise
most I-premise
likely I-premise
have I-premise
learned I-premise
the I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
more I-premise
or I-premise
less I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
way I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
when B-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
learner I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
language I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
country I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
spoken I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
natives I-premise
. O

He B-premise
may I-premise
find I-premise
native I-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
may I-premise
participate I-premise
in I-premise
groups I-premise
where I-premise
members I-premise
are I-premise
people I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
foreign I-premise
country I-premise
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
it B-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
better I-premise
understanding I-premise
of I-premise
language I-premise
essential I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

He B-premise
also I-premise
has I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
up I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
date I-premise
language I-premise
. O

Thus O
he B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
most I-claim
useful I-claim
idioms I-claim
, I-claim
proverbs I-claim
and I-claim
so I-claim
many I-claim
other I-claim
things I-claim
which I-claim
the I-claim
former I-claim
person I-claim
, I-claim
person I-claim
' I-claim
A I-claim
' I-claim
, I-claim
does I-claim
not I-claim
have I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
if B-premise
I I-premise
wanted I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
language I-premise
and I-premise
had I-premise
enough I-premise
money I-premise
to I-premise
afford I-premise
the I-premise
travel I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
definitely I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
second I-premise
choice I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
evidences I-premise
show I-premise
that I-premise
communication I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
factor I-premise
in I-premise
learning I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
language I-premise
. O

When B-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
exposed I-claim
to I-claim
an I-claim
environment I-claim
where I-claim
everybody I-claim
talks I-claim
to I-claim
you I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
language I-claim
you I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
and I-claim
expects I-claim
you I-claim
express I-claim
words I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
language I-claim
, I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
forced I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
it I-claim
as I-claim
soon I-claim
and I-claim
good I-claim
as I-claim
possible I-claim
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
although O
each O
of O
these O
methods O
have O
their O
pros O
and O
cons O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
that O
advantages B-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
country I-claim
in I-claim
which I-claim
is I-claim
spoken I-claim
outweigh I-claim
the I-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
other I-claim
way I-claim

of I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
language I-claim
. O

Spending O
time O
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
friends O
can O
add O
more O
to O
one O

life O
Despite O
friendship O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
values O
in O
a O
man O

life O
, O
people O
might O
have O
different O
preferences O

some O
of O
them O
prefer O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
one O
or O
two O
close O
friends O

while O
other B-claim
prefer I-claim

be I-claim
surrounded I-claim
by I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
prefer O
the O
second O
attitude O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
staying B-claim
in I-claim
contact I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
friends I-claim
gives I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
more I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
others I-claim
' I-claim
experiences I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
among B-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
there I-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
someone I-premise
who I-premise
practices I-premise
a I-premise
particular I-premise
sport I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
plays I-premise
an I-premise
instrument I-premise
or I-premise
likes I-premise
traveling I-premise
very I-premise
much I-premise
and I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
experiences I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
attracted I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
something I-premise
new I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
had I-premise
never I-premise
considered I-premise
before I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
, O
while B-claim
differences I-claim
give I-claim
the I-claim
opportunity I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
can I-claim
also I-claim
mean I-claim
that I-claim
sometimes I-claim
it I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
difficult I-claim
to I-claim
reach I-claim
an I-claim
agreement I-claim
. O

This B-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
happen I-premise
or I-premise
at I-premise
least I-premise
would I-premise
happen I-premise
rarely I-premise
if I-premise
one I-premise
decides I-premise
to I-premise
spend I-premise
time I-premise
with I-premise
one I-premise
or I-premise
two I-premise
close I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in B-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
that I-premise
interests I-premise
and I-premise
preferences I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
a B-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
friends I-claim
can I-claim
help I-claim
you I-claim
to I-claim
consider I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
possible I-claim
solutions I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
problem I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
you I-claim
more I-claim
open I-claim
- I-claim
minded I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
happen I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
and I-premise
ask I-premise
them I-premise
for I-premise
advice I-premise
, I-premise
your I-premise
friends I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
see I-premise
that I-premise
issue I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
different I-premise
point I-premise
of I-premise
views I-premise
and I-premise
accordingly I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
help I-premise
you I-premise
to I-premise
consider I-premise
better I-premise
all I-premise
advantages I-premise
and I-premise
disadvantages I-premise
. O

When B-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
just I-claim
few I-claim
close I-claim
friends I-claim
, I-claim
on I-claim
one I-claim
hand I-claim
you I-claim
develop I-claim
a I-claim
more I-claim
intimate I-claim
relationship I-claim
with I-claim
them I-claim
and I-claim
you I-claim
feel I-claim
you I-claim
can I-claim
trust I-claim
them I-claim
more I-claim
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
they B-premise
often I-premise
will I-premise
give I-premise
you I-premise
viewpoints I-premise
not I-premise
so I-premise
different I-premise
from I-premise
yours I-premise
, I-premise
adding I-premise
less I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
experience I-premise
. O

In O
sum O
, O
although O
each O
choice O
- O
few O
close O
friends O
or O
a O
large O
number O
of O
friends O
- O
presents O
its O
advantages O
and O
its O
weak O
points O
, O
I O
think O
that O
spending B-claim
time I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
friends I-claim
can I-claim
add I-claim
more I-claim

Public O
transportation O
keeps O
society O
from O
the O
depletion O
of O
natural O
resources O

The B-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
essential I-claim
thing I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
developed I-claim
society I-claim
. O

Public B-claim
transportation I-claim
keeps I-claim
society I-claim
from I-claim
the I-claim
depletion I-claim
of I-claim
natural I-claim
resources I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
loss I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
sense I-claim
of I-claim
community I-claim
. O

So O
, O
I O
think O
the O
government O
have O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
improving O
it O
. O

The B-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
way I-claim
to I-claim
conserve I-claim
natural I-claim
resources I-claim
gradually I-claim
run I-claim
out I-claim
. O

Cars B-premise
depend I-premise
on I-premise
oil I-premise
and I-premise
gasoline I-premise
to I-premise
move I-premise
. O

If B-premise
people I-premise
use I-premise
too I-premise
many I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
oil I-premise
and I-premise
gasoline I-premise
nonrenewable I-premise
will I-premise
run I-premise
out I-premise
quickly I-premise
. O

Instead B-premise
of I-premise
using I-premise
many I-premise
private I-premise
cars I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
use I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
bus I-premise
, I-premise
train I-premise
, I-premise
subway I-premise
, I-premise
each I-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
get I-premise
far I-premise
more I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
oil I-premise
and I-premise
gasoline I-premise
are I-premise
used I-premise
up I-premise
per I-premise
person I-premise
. O

The B-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
helps I-claim
in I-claim
reducing I-claim
the I-claim
air I-claim
pollution I-claim
. O

Cars B-premise
use I-premise
oil I-premise
and I-premise
gasoline I-premise
and I-premise
send I-premise
out I-premise
gas I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
carbon I-premise
dioxide I-premise
, I-premise
heat I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
. O

They B-premise
cause I-premise
pollution I-premise
and I-premise
make I-premise
the I-premise
Earth I-premise
warmer I-premise
. O

The B-premise
more I-premise
cars I-premise
are I-premise
driven I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
more I-premise
pollution I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
put I-premise
into I-premise
air I-premise
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
use I-premise
the I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
, I-premise
less I-premise
cars I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
used I-premise
and I-premise
less I-premise
pollution I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
emitted I-premise
. O

The B-premise
atmosphere I-premise
, I-premise
surrounding I-premise
us I-premise
, I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
protected I-premise
and I-premise
help I-premise
us I-premise
more I-premise
healthy I-premise
. O

The B-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
make I-claim
us I-claim
live I-claim
more I-claim
sociable I-claim
. O

When B-premise
we I-premise
drive I-premise
a I-premise
private I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
alone I-premise
or I-premise
only I-premise
our I-premise
family I-premise
members I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
already I-premise
know I-premise
and I-premise
lost I-premise
the I-premise
opportunity I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
friends I-premise
with I-premise
others I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
that I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
part I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
society I-premise
. O

When B-premise
using I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
more I-premise
people I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
chances I-premise
to I-premise
discovery I-premise
new I-premise
aspects I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Using B-claim
public I-claim
transportation I-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
advantages I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
facing I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
problems I-claim
: I-claim

the I-claim
environmental I-claim
population I-claim

the I-claim
isolation I-claim
in I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
depletion I-claim

So O
, O
the O
government O
have O
to O
invest O
more O
for O
it O
and O
encourage O
people O
to O
use O
. O

Some O

Everyone O

their O

At O

Some O

benefit O
a O

when O
they O
study O

Yet O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim

my I-claim
personality I-claim
. O

Studying B-claim
alone I-claim
helps I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
focus I-claim
more I-claim
in I-claim
our I-claim
lessons I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
am I-premise
a I-premise
type I-premise
of I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
comprehend I-premise
my I-premise
subjects I-premise
unless I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

I B-premise
can I-premise
prepare I-premise
my I-premise
schedules I-premise
, I-premise
guidelines I-premise
, I-premise
exercises I-premise
and I-premise
go I-premise
over I-premise
them I-premise
all I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
we B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
subjects I-premise
which I-premise
require I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
sit I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
alone I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
math I-premise
, I-premise
reading I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
drawing I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I B-premise
can I-premise
take I-premise
advantage I-premise
of I-premise
every I-premise
minute I-premise
without I-premise
wasting I-premise
by I-premise
studying I-premise
alone I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
we B-claim
are I-claim
building I-claim
our I-claim
personalities I-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
study I-claim
alone I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
answering B-premise
our I-premise
homework I-premise
alone I-premise
encourages I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
more I-premise
responsible I-premise
and I-premise
independent I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
it B-premise
motivates I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
accurate I-premise
in I-premise
our I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

Personally O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
fix I-premise
my I-premise
study I-premise
plan I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
specific I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
finish I-premise
it I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
improves I-premise
my I-premise
ability I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
more I-premise
precise I-premise
and I-premise
careful I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
to O
study O
and O
it O
is O
our O
right O
to O
choose O
which O
is O
suitable O
for O
our O
characters O
whether O
alone O
or O
with O
group O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I B-claim
agree I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
idea I-claim
of I-claim
studying I-claim
a I-claim
lone I-claim
since O
it B-claim
helps I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
focus I-claim
more I-claim
and I-claim
establish I-claim
my I-claim
personality I-claim
. O

Success O
needs O
us O
to O
work O
hard O
and O
sacrifice O
more O
whether O
we O
choose O
to O
study O
alone O
or O
with O
group O
. O

Some O
important O
characteristics O
of O
a O
co O
- O
worker O

At O
work O
, O
you O
meet O
people O
with O
diverse O
backgrounds O
and O
you O
are O
required O
to O
maintain O
sound O
relationships O
with O
many O
of O
them O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
pleasant O
work O
environment O
. O

However O
, O
the O
relationship O
you O
need O
to O
maintain O
with O
your O
co O
- O
worker O
is O
the O
most O
important O
one O
since O
he O
or O
she O
is O
the O
person O
who O
works O
very O
closely O
with O
you O
, O
and O
in O
most O
instances O
you O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
him O
or O
her O
. O

Therefore O
in O
my O
view O
, O
a B-claim
good I-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
worker I-claim
needs I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
three I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
characteristics I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
cooperation I-claim
, I-claim
trustworthiness I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
fellowship I-claim
. O

The B-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
workers I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
cooperative I-premise
with I-premise
one I-premise
another I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
cooperate I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
lots I-premise
of I-premise
disputes I-premise
. O

I B-premise
once I-premise
had I-premise
a I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
worker I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
too I-premise
family I-premise
conscious I-premise
. O

Therefore O
he B-premise
always I-premise
left I-premise
office I-premise
sharp I-premise
on I-premise
time I-premise
without I-premise
giving I-premise
any I-premise
consideration I-premise
whether I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
finished I-premise
or I-premise
not I-premise
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
his I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
protect I-premise
him I-premise
from I-premise
getting I-premise
caught I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
supervisor I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
authoritative I-premise
person I-premise
. O

However O
, O
one B-premise
day I-premise
I I-premise
wanted I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
off I-premise
early I-premise
because I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
my I-premise
mother I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
doctor I-premise
. O

When B-premise
I I-premise
requested I-premise
my I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
worker I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
a I-premise
helping I-premise
hand I-premise
to I-premise
finish I-premise
my I-premise
work I-premise
early I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
turned I-premise
down I-premise
my I-premise
request I-premise
giving I-premise
a I-premise
silly I-premise
excuse I-premise
. O

From B-premise
that I-premise
day I-premise
onwards I-premise
I I-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
offer I-premise
him I-premise
any I-premise
support I-premise
and I-premise
finally I-premise
he I-premise
was I-premise
transferred I-premise
from I-premise
our I-premise
department I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
distant I-premise
location I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
punishment I-premise
for I-premise
his I-premise
irresponsibility I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
believe O
if B-claim
the I-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
workers I-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
corporate I-claim
with I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
that I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
devastating I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
work I-claim
environment I-claim
. O

The B-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
workers I-claim
need I-claim
to I-claim
trust I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
. O

They B-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
act I-premise
on I-premise
suspicion I-premise
. O

This B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
important I-premise
aspect I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

I B-premise
came I-premise
across I-premise
a I-premise
situation I-premise
once I-premise
such I-premise
that I-premise
one I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
subordinates I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
suspect I-premise
his I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
worker I-premise
for I-premise
carrying I-premise
tales I-premise
to I-premise
me I-premise
. O

To B-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
extent I-premise
his I-premise
suspicion I-premise
was I-premise
valid I-premise
as I-premise
his I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
worker I-premise
made I-premise
several I-premise
attempts I-premise
to I-premise
highlight I-premise
the I-premise
drawbacks I-premise
of I-premise
him I-premise
. O

However O
I B-premise
never I-premise
encourage I-premise
tale I-premise
carriers I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
principle I-premise
and I-premise
therefore I-premise
his I-premise
co I-premise
- I-premise
worker I-premise
gave I-premise
up I-premise
talking I-premise
ill I-premise
against I-premise
him I-premise
with I-premise
me I-premise
. O

But B-premise
this I-premise
mistrust I-premise
continued I-premise
and I-premise
created I-premise
very I-premise
unpleasant I-premise
situations I-premise
for I-premise
everybody I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
department I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
the B-claim
co I-claim
- I-claim
workers I-claim
should I-claim
believe I-claim
in I-claim
fellowship I-claim
. O

This B-premise
helps I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
enjoy I-premise
their I-premise
work I-premise
life I-premise
while I-premise
building I-premise
up I-premise
very I-premise
strong I-premise
personal I-premise
relationships I-premise
. O

After O
all O
, O
you B-premise
spend I-premise
most I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise
day I-premise
at I-premise
office I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
company I-premise
in I-premise
office I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
certainly I-premise
a I-premise
blessing I-premise
. O

Distance O
learning O
and O
online O
computer O
classes O
should O
replace O
classroom O
During O
these O
digital O
age O
, O
the O
online O
classes O
has O
become O
more O
interest O
and O
more O
common O
in O
the O
society O
. O

Almost O
every O
school O
develops O
their O
online O
class O
systems O
. O

One O
question O
I O
always O
thought O
about O
is O
whether O
online O
computer O
classes O
should O
replace O
classroom O
learning O
. O

Although O
, O
online B-claim
classes I-claim
have I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
, O
for O
me O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
traditional I-claim
learning I-claim
classes I-claim
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the B-claim
participant I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
others I-claim
like I-claim
classmates I-claim
or I-claim
professors I-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
factor I-claim
in I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

Working B-premise
in I-premise
group I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
more I-premise
discussion I-premise
and I-premise
more I-premise
opinion I-premise
among I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
the B-premise
discussion I-premise
class I-premise
results I-premise
in I-premise
expanded I-premise
children I-premise
vision I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
respect I-premise
to I-premise
others I-premise
roommate I-premise
's I-premise
ideas I-premise
. O

Unlike B-premise
the I-premise
distance I-premise
learning I-premise
that I-premise
children I-premise
have I-premise
few I-premise
opportunities I-premise
to I-premise
discuss I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
classroom B-claim
learning I-claim
provides I-claim
other I-claim
activities I-claim
than I-claim
studying I-claim
. O

During B-premise
student I-premise
's I-premise
free I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
activities I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
join I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
playing I-premise
sports I-premise
, I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
lab I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
library I-premise
. O

These B-premise
activities I-premise
lead I-premise
to I-premise
more I-premise
interact I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

Connection B-premise
with I-premise
friends I-premise
improves I-premise
their I-premise
IQ I-premise
abilities I-premise
, O
furthermore O
, O
they B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
societies I-premise
. O

While O
the B-premise
online I-premise
course I-premise
keeps I-premise
the I-premise
children I-premise
at I-premise
their I-premise
home I-premise
only I-premise
. O

Lastly O
, O
in B-claim
school I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
professors I-claim
that I-claim
guided I-claim
you I-claim
during I-claim
you I-claim
had I-claim
a I-claim
problem I-claim
or I-claim
needed I-claim
an I-claim
advice I-claim
. O

The B-premise
professor I-premise
provides I-premise
good I-premise
answers I-premise
to I-premise
you I-premise
. O

They B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
mind I-premise
helping I-premise
you I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
never I-premise
leave I-premise
you I-premise
alone I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
got I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
in B-premise
distance I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
these I-premise
aspects I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
professor I-premise
had I-premise
reduced I-premise
their I-premise
important I-premise
. O

The B-premise
professor I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
assigned I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
only I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
there B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
response I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
teachers I-premise
when I-premise
children I-premise
ask I-premise
them I-premise
a I-premise
question I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
traditional B-claim
learning I-claim
still I-claim
has I-claim
many I-claim
benefits I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
. O

But O
in O
the O
future O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
distance O
learning O
become O
more O
popular O
and O
ordinary O
in O
schools O
. O

Non O
academic O
subjects O
should O
be O
removed O
from O
syllabus O
Students O
have O
become O
more O
and O
more O
stressed O
during O
the O
last O
few O
years O
due O
to O
the O
increase O
in O
academic O
tasks O
assigned O
by O
their O
teachers O
to O
improve O
their O
academic O
success O
. O

While O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
non B-claim
- I-claim
academic I-claim
subjects I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
completely I-claim
removed I-claim
, I-claim
I I-claim
strongly I-claim
disagree I-claim
with I-claim
that I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
from B-premise
the I-premise
health I-premise
point I-premise
of I-premise
view I-premise
, I-premise
schools I-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
deliver I-premise
academic I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

If B-premise
physical I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
removed I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
syllabus I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
considerable I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
on I-premise
students I-premise
’ I-premise
health I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
after B-premise
studying I-premise
and I-premise
sitting I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
classroom I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
morning I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
some I-premise
outdoor I-premise
activities I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
stretching I-premise
, I-premise
jogging I-premise
and I-premise
playing I-premise
ball I-premise
games I-premise
, I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
learning I-premise
ability I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
afternoon I-premise
classes I-premise
. O

Removing B-claim
physical I-claim
classes I-claim
from I-claim
school I-claim
education I-claim
will I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
be I-claim
harmful I-claim
to I-claim
young I-claim
people I-claim

’s I-claim
health I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
also I-claim
decrease I-claim
their I-claim
learning I-claim
capability I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
schools B-premise
are I-premise
responsible I-premise
for I-premise
developing I-premise
their I-premise
students I-premise
into I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
rounded I-premise
people I-premise
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
important I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
than I-premise
to I-premise
success I-premise
only I-premise
academically I-premise
. O

Success B-premise
in I-premise
life I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
ultimate I-premise
goal I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
requires I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
academic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
practical I-premise
life I-premise
skills I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
cooking I-premise
, I-premise
good I-premise
communication I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
teamwork I-premise
spirit I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
school B-claim
education I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
focus I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
academic I-claim
development I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
student I-claim
as O
it B-premise
is I-premise
much I-premise
more I-premise
crucial I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
them I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
independent I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
students B-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
practical I-claim
skills I-claim
after I-claim
school I-claim
hours I-claim
from I-claim
their I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
idea I-premise
because O
most B-premise
young I-premise
people I-premise
would I-premise
rather I-premise
watch I-premise
TV I-premise
or I-premise
play I-premise
computer I-premise
games I-premise
after I-premise
school I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
learning I-premise
life I-premise
skills I-premise
from I-premise
their I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents B-premise
are I-premise
usually I-premise
too I-premise
busy I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
daily I-premise
jobs I-premise
to I-premise
teach I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
the I-premise
life I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
non B-claim
- I-claim
academic I-claim
subjects I-claim
are I-claim
as I-claim
essential I-claim
as I-claim
academic I-claim
subjects I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
student I-claim
’s I-claim
development I-claim
. O

Therefore O
, O
schools B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
remove I-claim
these I-claim
subjects I-claim
. O

Follow O
the O
New O
Customs O
of O
the O
New O
Country O
or O
Not O
? O

When O
people O
move O
to O
another O
country O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
they O
will O
face O
the O
choice O
between O
following O
the O
customs O
of O
the O
new O
country O
or O
keeping O
their O
original O
one O
. O

Some O
people O
choose O
the O
former O
one O
to O
assimilate O
themselves O
into O
the O
new O
culture O
, O
while O
some O
insist O
the O
latter O
one O
because O
the O
new O
customs O
are O
difficult O
to O
be O
accepted O
. O

As O
for O
me O
, O
I B-claim
would I-claim
follow I-claim
the I-claim
new I-claim
customs I-claim
, I-claim
if I-claim
I I-claim
migrated I-claim
to I-claim
another I-claim
country I-claim
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
it B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
easier I-claim
for I-claim
people I-claim

One B-premise

These O
happy O
moments O
are O
both O
in O
their O
childhood O

their O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
childhood B-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
happiest I-claim
time I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
. O

First O
, O
in B-claim
childhood I-claim
most I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
happier I-claim
than I-claim
in I-claim
adulthood I-claim
. O

They B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
worry I-premise
about I-premise
bills I-premise
, I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
would I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
be I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

They B-premise
just I-premise
worry I-premise
about I-premise
two I-premise
things I-premise
: I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
fun I-premise
, I-premise
learn I-premise
and I-premise
be I-premise
happy I-premise
. O

A B-premise
child I-premise
's I-premise
daily I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
playing I-premise
and I-premise
sleeping I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
young I-premise

I I-premise
just I-premise
came I-premise
home I-premise
from I-premise
school I-premise

and I-premise
then I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
took I-premise
my I-premise
bike I-premise
or I-premise
soccer I-premise
ball I-premise
and I-premise
go I-premise
out I-premise
and I-premise
play I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
friends I-premise
in I-premise
my I-premise
neighborhood I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
I B-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
worry I-premise
about I-premise
costs I-premise
and I-premise
other I-premise
things I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
just I-premise
had I-premise
fun I-premise
and I-premise
learned I-premise
. O

Also O
, O
people B-claim
are I-claim
most I-claim
creative I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
were I-claim
children I-claim
, O
children B-premise
imagine I-premise
new I-premise
things I-premise
and I-premise
games I-premise
just I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
fun I-premise
and I-premise
be I-premise
happy I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
childhood B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
period I-premise
where I-premise
people I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
school I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
school B-claim
memories I-claim
are I-claim
one I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
best I-claim
memories I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
. O

There B-premise
you I-premise
learn I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
your I-premise
first I-premise
love I-premise
, I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
new I-premise
long I-premise
- I-premise
lasting I-premise
friendships I-premise
and I-premise
of I-premise
- I-premise
course I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise

fun I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
father I-premise
's I-premise
best I-premise
moments I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
life I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
school I-premise
years I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
he B-premise
is I-premise
still I-premise
in I-premise
- I-premise
touch I-premise
with I-premise
some I-premise
of I-premise
his I-premise
classmates I-premise
and I-premise
sometimes I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
together I-premise
and I-premise
share I-premise
their I-premise
childhood I-premise
memories I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
childhood B-claim
is I-claim
, I-claim
indeed I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
happiest I-claim
moments I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
person I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
life O
and O
one O
childhood O
and O
people O
should O
live O
their O
childhood O
thoroughly O
. O

Learning O

be O
independent O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
adults O
Learning O
to O
be O
independent O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
adults O
. O

However O
, O
how O
early O
the O
children O
leave O
their O
parents O
is O
a O
difficult O
issue O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
staying B-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
parents I-claim
for I-claim
longer I-claim
time I-claim
does I-claim
more I-claim
benefits I-claim
than I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
adult I-claim
. O

My O
opinion O
is O
based O
on O
creating O
memories O
with O
parents O
, O
saving O
money O
, O
and O
taking O
advice O
from O
parents O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
upsides O
is O
that O
the B-premise
young I-premise
adult I-premise
can I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
experience I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

The B-premise
young I-premise
adult I-premise
has I-premise
to I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
create I-premise
memories I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
dad I-premise
and I-premise
mom I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
. O

When B-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
of I-premise
low I-premise
possibilities I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
hometown I-premise
. O

If B-premise
he I-premise
lives I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
parents I-premise
for I-premise
longer I-premise
time I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
chances I-premise
to I-premise
share I-premise
the I-premise
feelings I-premise
, I-premise
exercise I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
travel I-premise
together I-premise
. O

All B-premise
memories I-premise
become I-premise
priceless I-premise
treasure I-premise
as I-premise
time I-premise
passes I-premise
by I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
think O
undergoing B-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
is I-claim
worthwhile I-claim
. O

Furthermore O
, O
living B-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
costs I-premise
less I-premise
than I-premise
living I-premise
outside I-premise
. O

Learning B-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
independent I-premise
means I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
young I-premise
adult I-premise
needs I-premise
to I-premise
leave I-premise
home I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
he B-premise
may I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
rent I-premise
a I-premise
house I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
rental I-premise
would I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
burden I-premise
for I-premise
parents I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
another B-premise
daily I-premise
expense I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
the I-premise
considerable I-premise
outgoings I-premise
. O

Spending B-premise
much I-premise
money I-premise
may I-premise
not I-premise
result I-premise
in I-premise
what I-premise
the I-premise
parents I-premise
expect I-premise
their I-premise
children I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
the B-claim
parents I-claim
can I-claim
save I-claim
money I-claim
, I-claim
if I-claim
their I-claim
children I-claim
live I-claim
with I-claim
them I-claim
longer I-claim
. O

The O
third O
convincing O
reason O
is O
that O
the B-premise
young I-premise
adult I-premise
needs I-premise
father I-premise
and I-premise
mother I-premise
's I-premise
suggestions I-premise
. O

When B-premise
in I-premise
dilemma I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
parents I-premise
can I-premise
comfort I-premise
him I-premise
and I-premise
give I-premise
him I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
hand I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
most I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
him I-premise
can I-premise
give I-premise
a I-premise
suitable I-premise
advice I-premise
and I-premise
lead I-premise
him I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
way I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
parents I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
help I-premise
him I-premise
immediately I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
suffer I-premise
more I-premise
pain I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
taking B-claim
advice I-claim
from I-claim
parents I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
young I-claim
adult I-claim
can I-claim
go I-claim
through I-claim
obstacles I-claim
easily I-claim
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
living B-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
longer I-claim
brings I-claim
about I-claim
memories I-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
, I-claim
less I-claim
cost I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
advice I-claim
from I-claim
parents I-claim
. O

Hence O
, O
staying B-claim
longer I-claim
with I-claim
parents I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
choice I-claim
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
or O
disagree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
a O
zoo O
has O
no O
useful O
purpose O

Some O
people O
may O
believe O
that O
a O
zoo O
is O
futile O
in O
the O
era O
of O
globalization O
, O
which O
people O
can O
develop O
their O
knowledge O
fast O
and O
easily O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
is I-claim
invaluable I-claim
for I-claim
human I-claim
beings I-claim
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
crucial I-claim
for I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

It B-claim
helps I-claim
animals I-claim
out I-claim
of I-claim
extinction I-claim
. O

Also O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
interesting I-claim
travel I-claim
location I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
gives I-claim
humans I-claim
new I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

When O
you O
were O
so O
young O
that O
you O
did O
not O
know O
many O
kinds O
of O
animals O
, O
what O
should O
you O
do O
if O
there O
were O
no O
zoo O
? O

Inevitably O
, O
the B-premise
zoo I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
important I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
innate I-premise
learning I-premise
. O

The B-premise
zoo I-premise
also I-premise
let I-premise
students I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
learning I-premise
biology I-premise
practically I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
observe I-premise
animals I-premise
' I-premise
behaviors I-premise
and I-premise
features I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
practical B-premise
learning I-premise
help I-premise
students I-premise
relax I-premise
from I-premise
a I-premise
boring I-premise
lecture I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
researchers B-premise
need I-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
to I-premise
pick I-premise
up I-premise
some I-premise
examples I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
researches I-premise
because O
it B-premise
has I-premise
diverse I-premise
species I-premise
of I-premise
animals I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
preserves I-claim
a I-claim
large I-claim
number I-claim
of I-claim
rare I-claim
animals I-claim
and I-claim
provides I-claim
them I-claim
safe I-claim
habitats I-claim
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
so I-premise
harmful I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
forest I-premise
. O

They B-premise
, I-premise
fed I-premise
by I-premise
zookeepers I-premise
, I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
food I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we B-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
artificial I-premise
insemenation I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
nearly I-premise
extinct I-premise
wildlife I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
because B-premise
of I-premise
all I-premise
weird I-premise
, I-premise
acute I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
beautiful I-premise
animals I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
tourist I-premise
attraction I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
tourists I-premise
who I-premise
seek I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
those I-premise
animals I-premise
closely I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
zoo I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
both I-premise
national I-premise
and I-premise
foreign I-premise
tourists I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
receive I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
deal I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
. O

That B-premise
also I-premise
make I-premise
money I-premise
flow I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
economics I-premise
become I-premise
better I-premise
. O

It B-claim
benefits I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
certain I-claim
country I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
saves I-claim
animals I-claim
in I-claim
danger I-claim
of I-claim
extinction I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
helps I-claim
people I-claim
around I-claim
the I-claim
world I-claim
have I-claim
better I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
zoo I-claim
is I-claim
so I-claim
useful I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
earth I-claim
. O

Nowadays O
, O
spending O
budget O
on O
space O
exploration O
is O
not O
reasonable O
Space O
exploration O
, O
for O
discovery O
of O
out O
of O
space O
, O
has O
been O
possible O
for O
human O
in O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

The O
United O
state O

Russia O
are O
the O
important O
countries O
that O
spend O
large O
budgets O
for O
the O
research O
of O
this O
subject O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
spending B-claim
the I-claim
budget I-claim
for I-claim
space I-claim
exploration I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
activity I-claim
to I-claim
save I-claim
living I-claim
of I-claim
humanity I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
governments I-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
space I-premise
exploration I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
activity I-premise
that I-premise
wastes I-premise
the I-premise
budget I-premise
, O
while O
the B-premise
essential I-premise
challenge I-premise
of I-premise
humanity I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
discovery I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
living I-premise
. O

In B-premise
20th I-premise
century I-premise
, I-premise
although I-premise
human I-premise
being I-premise
succeeded I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
out I-premise
of I-premise
space I-premise
by I-premise
means I-premise
of I-premise
new I-premise
technologies I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
rockets I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
finding I-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
place I-premise
for I-premise
living I-premise
in I-premise
another I-premise
planet I-premise
is I-premise
impossible I-premise
until I-premise
now I-premise
. O

In B-premise
during I-premise
history I-premise
, I-premise
our I-premise
planet I-premise
is I-premise
threatening I-premise
by I-premise
many I-premise
of I-premise

it I-premise

an I-premise
enormous I-premise
danger I-premise
for I-premise
living I-premise
of I-premise
humanity I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
very I-claim
significant I-claim
to I-claim
find I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
place I-claim

Space B-premise

power I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
cold I-premise

In B-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise

many I-premise

try I-premise

prevent I-premise
attach I-premise

In B-premise

Both B-premise

As O
a O
result O

In O
summary O
, O
spending B-claim

Although O
exploring O

nowadays O
most O

Friendship O
is O
more O
important O
than O
mistake O
by O
a O
friend O
, O
although O
mistake O
is O
terrible O

There O
is O
an O
argument O
regrading O
weather O
letting O
a O
friend O
make O
a O
mistake O
is O
better O
than O
taking O
action O
that O
risks O
destroying O
a O
friendship O
. O

It O
is O
widely O
accepted O
by O
many O
people O
that O
a O
mistake O
will O
return O
sometimes O
terrible O
result O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
friendship B-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
important I-claim
than I-claim
mistake I-claim
by I-claim
a I-claim
friend I-claim
, O
although O
mistake B-claim
is I-claim
terrible I-claim
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
present O
two O
reasons O
supporting O
my O
opinion O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a B-premise
mistake I-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
last I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
but I-premise
a I-premise
friendship I-premise
lasts I-premise
forever I-premise
. O

Anybody B-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
remember I-premise
mistakes I-premise
. O

If B-premise
someone I-premise
remembers I-premise
mistake I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
or I-premise
she I-premise
has I-premise
a I-premise
closed I-premise
mind I-premise
. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
mistakes B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
forgotten I-premise
quickly I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
my B-premise
friend I-premise
Lee I-premise
made I-premise
a I-premise
mistake I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
broke I-premise
my I-premise
precious I-premise
gift I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I B-premise
forgot I-premise
about I-premise
it I-premise
just I-premise
after I-premise
two I-premise
days I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
felt I-premise
at I-premise
peace I-premise
with I-premise
him I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
might O
say O
I O
am O
silly O
, O
but O
I O
think O
mistake B-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
forgettable I-claim
than I-claim
friendship I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
Everybody B-claim
makes I-claim
mistake I-claim
. O

However O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
end I-premise
a I-premise
friendship I-premise
whenever I-premise
your I-premise
friend I-premise
makes I-premise
a I-premise
mistake I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
no I-premise
friends I-premise
around I-premise
you I-premise
. O

I O
agree O
if B-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
makes I-premise
very I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
mistake I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
end I-premise
a I-premise
friendship I-premise
. O

However O
, O
when B-premise
the I-premise
mistake I-premise
friend I-premise
made I-premise
was I-premise
not I-premise
a I-premise
big I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
friend I-premise
and I-premise
forgive I-premise
it I-premise
because O
a B-premise
friend I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
gift I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
life I-premise
. O

According B-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
research I-premise
, I-premise
85 I-premise
% I-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
answered I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
best I-premise
gift I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
. O

I O
think O
that O
a B-claim
mistake I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
brake I-claim
friendship I-claim
if I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
a I-claim
big I-claim
because O
friendship B-claim
is I-claim
forever I-claim
and I-claim
gift I-claim
our I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Students O
should O
be O
required O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
tests O

The O
issue O
at O
hand O
is O
if O
the O
schools O
should O
require O
students O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
exams O
. O

This O
issue O
is O
important O
because O
nowadays O
many O
people O
cast O
doubt O
on O
it O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
standardized B-claim
tests I-claim
are I-claim
valuable I-claim
option I-claim
for I-claim
educational I-claim
system I-claim
as I-claim
long I-claim
as I-claim
it I-claim
would I-claim
help I-claim
teachers I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
if I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
are I-claim
really I-claim
getting I-claim
knowledge I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
standardized B-claim
tests I-claim
are I-claim
preferable I-claim
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they B-premise
help I-premise
teachers I-premise
to I-premise
fairly I-premise
grade I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
. O

For O
example O
some B-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
so I-premise
active I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
lessons I-premise
, I-premise
cause I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
already I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
issue I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
exams B-premise
could I-premise
be I-premise
the I-premise
only I-premise
way I-premise
for I-premise
teachers I-premise
to I-premise
see I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
abilities I-premise
of I-premise
those I-premise
students I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
many B-premise
teachers I-premise
rely I-premise
only I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
exam I-premise
results I-premise
while I-premise
grading I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
, O
so O
the B-premise
usage I-premise
of I-premise
standardized I-premise
tests I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
superior I-premise
option I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Additionally O
, O
standardized B-premise
tests I-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
good I-premise
chance I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
apply I-premise
their I-premise
knowledge I-premise
on I-premise
practice I-premise
. O

Since O
, O
some B-premise
students I-premise
may I-premise
get I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
simply I-premise
rewriting I-premise
solved I-premise
problems I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
blackboard I-premise
, O
so O
they B-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
problems I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
. O

However O
, O
standardized B-premise
tests I-premise
offer I-premise
them I-premise
such I-premise
chance I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
schools B-claim
should I-claim
require I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
standardized I-claim
tests I-claim
, I-claim
as I-claim
long I-claim
as I-claim
this I-claim
option I-claim
helps I-claim
to I-claim
both I-claim
sides I-claim
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
requirement B-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
standardized I-claim
tests I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
choice I-claim
, O
since O
in B-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
teachers I-premise
can I-premise
compare I-premise
the I-premise
level I-premise
of I-premise
knowledge I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
students I-premise
. O

In B-premise
any I-premise
class I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
students I-premise
who I-premise
will I-premise
show I-premise
low I-premise
academic I-premise
performance I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
teachers I-premise
could I-premise
work I-premise
with I-premise
them I-premise
more I-premise
intensively I-premise
. O

I O
support O
the O
points O
of O
those O
who O
say O
that O
standardized B-premise
tests I-premise
are I-premise
required I-premise
over I-premise
those I-premise
who I-premise
do I-premise
n’t I-premise
because O
if B-premise
the I-premise
teacher I-premise
would I-premise
know I-premise
the I-premise
level I-premise
of I-premise
each I-premise
student I-premise
he I-premise
would I-premise
fairly I-premise
share I-premise
his I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
all I-premise
of I-premise
them I-premise
. O

Ultimately O
I O
feel O
that O
schools B-claim
which I-claim
obligate I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
standardized I-claim
tests I-claim
are I-claim
right I-claim
. O

I O
belive O
this O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
these B-claim
schools I-claim
can I-claim
qualitatively I-claim
check I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
giving I-claim
an I-claim
appropriate I-claim
education I-claim
to I-claim
their I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Most O
difficult O
experiences O
will O
become O
valuable O
lessons O

There O
is O
a O
famous O
old O
saying O
that O
failure O
is O
the O
mother O
of O
success O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
, O
some O
people O
advocate O
that O
some O
difficulties O
people O
met O
at O
their O
early O
ages O
will O
become O
an O
invaluable O
fortune O
in O
their O
future O
lives O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
is O
n't O
supposed O
to O
be O
that O
case O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
am O
in O
favor O
the O
former O
statement O
that O
some B-claim
tough I-claim
experiences I-claim
people I-claim
met I-claim
before I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
helpful I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
path I-claim
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
hardship B-premise
makes I-premise
people I-premise
realize I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
cherish I-premise
and I-premise
compliment I-premise
the I-premise
common I-premise
but I-premise
wonderful I-premise
little I-premise
things I-premise
happened I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
shining I-premise
weather I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
delicious I-premise
breakfast I-premise
and I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

People B-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
such I-premise
nice I-premise
spirit I-premise
usually I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
find I-premise
the I-premise
true I-premise
love I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
being I-premise
seduced I-premise
by I-premise
greed I-premise
as I-premise
to I-premise
lose I-premise
themselves I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
end I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
experiences B-claim
of I-claim
difficulties I-claim
teach I-claim
them I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
keep I-claim
a I-claim
nice I-claim
mood I-claim
and I-claim
have I-claim
confidence I-claim
all I-claim
the I-claim
time I-claim
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
experienced I-claim
lots I-claim
of I-claim
difficulties I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
calmer I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
in I-claim
troubles I-claim
. O

Because O
they B-premise
already I-premise
have I-premise
such I-premise
experiences I-premise
of I-premise
overcoming I-premise
some I-premise
difficulties I-premise
, O
they B-premise
are I-premise
conscious I-premise
of I-premise
what I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
and I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
do I-premise
when I-premise
fierce I-premise
crisis I-premise
happens I-premise
. O

Those B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
their I-premise
ambitions I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
career I-premise
because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
aware I-premise
of I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
lead I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
reach I-premise
success I-premise
despite I-premise
what I-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
difficulties I-premise
are I-premise
getting I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
way I-premise
. O

So O
, O
to O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
both O
not O
afraid O
of O
difficulties O
and O
appreciating O
common O
but O
pleasant O
things O
in O
their O
lives O

drive O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
most B-claim
tough I-claim
experiences I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
path I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
priceless I-claim
treasure I-claim
to I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Remember O
if O
you O
are O
afraid O
of O
encountering O
difficulties O
, O
then O
you O
will O
be O
in O
the O
troubles O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Life O
in O
  O
a O
city O
is O
much O
better O
than O
life O
in O
the O
countryside O
As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
life B-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
city I-claim
is I-claim
much I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
life I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
countryside I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
in B-claim
the I-claim
city I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
much I-claim
better I-claim
education I-claim
system I-claim
. O

This O
means O
, O
that O
the B-premise
schools I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
universities I-premise
have I-premise
well I-premise
equipped I-premise
classes I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
famous I-premise
professors I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
in I-premise
such I-premise
places I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
city B-claim
provides I-claim
more I-claim
work I-claim
opportunities I-claim
than I-claim
the I-claim
countryside I-claim
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
more I-premise
jobs I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
also I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
paid I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
living B-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
city I-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
expensive I-premise
, O
but O
incomes B-premise
are I-premise
higher I-premise
too O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in B-claim
the I-claim
urban I-claim
areas I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
more I-claim
citizens I-claim
what I-claim
means I-claim
, I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
culture I-claim
diversity I-claim
is I-claim
huge I-claim
. O

Meeting B-premise
and I-premise
knowing I-premise
new I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
tradition I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
unforgettable I-premise
experience I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
could I-premise
influence I-premise
on I-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
previous I-premise
habits I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
city I-premise
has I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
organised I-premise
lines I-premise
of I-premise
transport I-premise
. O

The B-premise
buses I-premise
and I-premise
trains I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
frequent I-premise
than I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
countryside I-premise
, O
so O
the B-claim
city I-claim
provides I-claim
better I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

However O
, O
in B-claim
the I-claim
countryside I-claim
there I-claim
are I-claim
many I-claim
places I-claim
to I-claim
rest I-claim
, I-claim
because I-claim
of I-claim
its I-claim
location I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
peaceful B-premise
and I-premise
close I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
nature I-premise
areas I-premise
could I-premise
help I-premise
to I-premise
avoid I-premise
worries I-premise
and I-premise
sadness I-premise
. O

Taking O
all O
into O
account O
, O
I O
think O
that O
living B-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
city I-claim
is I-claim
much I-claim
better I-claim
nowadays I-claim
, O
because O
of O
the O
opportunities O
it O
gives O
. O

Today O
living O
in O
the O
rural O
places O
is O
in O
most O
causes O
connected O
with O
agrarian O
lifestyle O
, O
which O
for O
me O
is O
without O
perspective O
. O

If O
I O
could O
decide O
I O
would O
chose O
living O
in O
the O
city O
for O
sure O
. O

and O
becoming O
more O
perfect O
every O
day O
. O

Communication O
nowadays O
depends O
on O
technology O
pretty O
much O
. O

Voice O
mail O
, O
e O
- O
mail O
, O
telephone O
or O
just O
traditional O
way O
: O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
. O

However O
, O
I B-claim
prefer I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
3 I-claim
reasons I-claim
: I-claim
convenience I-claim
, I-claim
honest I-claim
expression I-claim
and I-claim
fluency I-claim
in I-claim
communicating I-claim
. O

Everyone O
agrees O
that O
e B-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
has I-claim
been I-claim
a I-claim
great I-claim
way I-claim
of I-claim
communication I-claim
. O

You B-premise
can I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
others I-premise
from I-premise
thousands I-premise
mile I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
in I-premise
Vietnam I-premise
and I-premise
another I-premise
person I-premise
is I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
US I-premise
- I-premise
half I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
Earth I-premise
, I-premise
no I-premise
matter I-premise
how I-premise
far I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
keep I-premise
contact I-premise
. O

We B-premise
will I-premise
never I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
worry I-premise
if I-premise
our I-premise
mails I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
sent I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
address I-premise
. O

If B-premise
the I-premise
address I-premise
is I-premise
wrong I-premise
, I-premise
then I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
know I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
e B-premise
- I-premise
mail I-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
take I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
time I-premise
: I-premise
just I-premise
a I-premise
click I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
writing B-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
helps I-claim
people I-claim
express I-claim
honestly I-claim
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
the B-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
conversations I-premise
make I-premise
them I-premise
feel I-premise
stupid I-premise
. O

Sometimes B-premise
, I-premise
their I-premise
ideas I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
expressed I-premise
as I-premise
exactly I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
expect I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I B-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
about I-premise
a I-premise
ticklish I-premise
problem I-premise
like I-premise
her I-premise
behavior I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
hard I-premise
for I-premise
me I-premise
to I-premise
face I-premise
her I-premise
and I-premise
explain I-premise
what I-premise
she I-premise
should I-premise
do I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
e B-premise
- I-premise
mail I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
tool I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
me I-premise
speak I-premise
out I-premise
. O

She B-premise
will I-premise
just I-premise
read I-premise
my I-premise
e I-premise
- I-premise
mail I-premise
instead I-premise
of I-premise
listening I-premise
to I-premise
my I-premise
voice I-premise
which I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
her I-premise
annoyed I-premise
. O

I B-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
worry I-premise
about I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
thing I-premise

can I-premise
make I-premise
my I-premise
opinion I-premise
become I-premise
unpersuasive I-premise
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
every B-premise
communication I-premise
needs I-premise
fluency I-premise

so O
people B-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
exactly I-premise
and I-premise
remember I-premise
it I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
long I-premise
time I-premise
. O

Voice B-premise
email I-premise
or I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
conversations I-premise
sometimes I-premise
make I-premise
reserve I-premise
people I-premise
feel I-premise
not I-premise
very I-premise
confident I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
I I-premise
face I-premise
my I-premise
parents I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
speak I-premise
out I-premise
every I-premise
idea I-premise
and I-premise
express I-premise
consecutively I-premise
. O

They B-premise
may I-premise
stop I-premise
me I-premise
, I-premise
speak I-premise
something I-premise
against I-premise
it I-premise
and I-premise
that I-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
forget I-premise
what I-premise
I I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
say I-premise
. O

Anyone B-premise
can I-premise
meet I-premise
this I-premise
problem I-premise
once I-premise
in I-premise
any I-premise
conversation I-premise
. O

E B-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
helps I-claim
me I-claim
arrange I-claim
my I-claim
idea I-claim
perfectly I-claim
and I-claim
make I-claim
it I-claim
persuasive I-claim
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
to O
compare O
to O
all O
ways O
of O
communication O
, O
I O
really O
think O
that O
e B-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
greatest I-claim
way I-claim
for I-claim
major I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
. O

Its B-claim
convenience I-claim
saves I-claim
our I-claim
time I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
honesty O
is O
necessary O
for O
every O
conversation O
and O
also O
fluency O
ca O
n't O
be O
missing O
for O
a O
persuasive O
expression O
. O

Communicating O
via O
e O
- O
mail O
and O
voice O
mail O
vs O
Telephone O
and O
face O
- O
to O
face O

Although O
many O
people O
prefer O
communicating O
by O
telephone O
or O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
, O
personally O
I O
believe O
that O
communicating B-claim
by I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mails I-claim
or I-claim
voice I-claim
mails I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
to O
support O
this O
idea O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
in O
this O
essay O
. O

Firstly O
, O
communicating B-claim
by I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
is I-claim
easy I-claim
. O

Many B-premise
people I-premise
have I-premise
problems I-premise
with I-premise
calling I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
acquainted I-premise
with I-premise
. O

In B-premise
this I-premise
case I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
so I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
write I-premise
an I-premise
e I-premise
- I-premise
mail I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
leave I-premise
a I-premise
voice I-premise
mail I-premise
because O
even B-premise
shy I-premise
people I-premise
feel I-premise
themselves I-premise
more I-premise
confident I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
you B-claim
can I-claim
write I-claim
an I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
at I-claim
any I-claim
time I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
day I-claim
. O

As O
for O
me O
, O
I B-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
study I-premise
at I-premise
the I-premise
university I-premise

and I-premise
I I-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
spare I-premise
time I-premise
during I-premise
the I-premise
day I-premise
. O

I B-premise
get I-premise
home I-premise
at I-premise
about I-premise
midnight I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
still I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
answer I-premise
some I-premise
questions I-premise
and I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
some I-premise
routine I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

I B-premise
might I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
call I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
or I-premise
to I-premise
meet I-premise
with I-premise
him I-premise
or I-premise
her I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
appropriate I-premise
time I-premise
so O
for B-premise
me I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
to I-premise
leave I-premise
a I-premise
voice I-premise
mail I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
when B-claim
you I-claim
write I-claim
an I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
you I-claim
have I-claim
enough I-claim
time I-claim
to I-claim
think I-claim
carefully I-claim
about I-claim
what I-claim
you I-claim
are I-claim
writing I-claim
and I-claim
how I-claim
it I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
better I-claim
to I-claim
express I-claim
yourself I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
you B-premise
can I-premise
change I-premise
the I-premise
word I-premise
order I-premise
or I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
choose I-premise
more I-premise
appropriate I-premise
style I-premise
to I-premise
sound I-premise
more I-premise
polite I-premise
. O

When B-premise
you I-premise
speak I-premise
face I-premise
- I-premise
to I-premise
- I-premise
face I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
as I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
control I-premise
every I-premise
word I-premise
as I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
write I-premise
an I-premise
e I-premise
- I-premise
mail I-premise
. O

And O
finally O
, O
there B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
disturb I-claim
people I-claim
by I-claim
sending I-claim
them I-claim
an I-claim
e I-claim
- I-claim
mail I-claim
. O

You B-premise
should I-premise
not I-premise
worry I-premise
about I-premise
interrupting I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
conversation I-premise
or I-premise
some I-premise
other I-premise
business I-premise
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
for O
me O
both O
options O
of O
communicating O
are O
possible O
, O
but O
if O
this O
is O
an O
important O
and O
not O
urgent O
question O
I B-claim
would I-claim
prefer I-claim
to I-claim
answer I-claim
it I-claim
by I-claim
means I-claim
of I-claim
internet I-claim
or I-claim
voice I-claim
mail I-claim
. O

Should O
we O
require O
our O
young O
children O
to O
learn O
music O
and O
art O

Every O
parents O
expect O
their O
children O
to O
be O
outstanding O
and O
successful O
. O

In O
order O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
they O
start O
cultivating O
their O
children O
when O
they O
are O
very O
young O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
basic O
knowledge O
like O
language O
or O
science O
, O
music O
and O
art O
are O
usually O
on O
the O
must O
- O
learn O
list O
of O
the O
parents O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
children B-claim
should I-claim
learn I-claim
music I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
young I-claim
age I-claim
because O
they B-claim
do I-claim
contribute I-claim
several I-claim
merits I-claim
to I-claim
them I-claim
. O

First O
, O
it B-claim
's I-claim
very I-claim
suitable I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
develop I-claim
senses I-claim
of I-claim
music I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
young I-claim
. O

Children B-premise
absorb I-premise
things I-premise
quickly I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
bear I-premise
exact I-premise
the I-premise
ability I-premise
needed I-premise
in I-premise
music I-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
- I-premise
imagination I-premise
. O

Music B-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
like I-premise
math I-premise
or I-premise
language I-premise
which I-premise
has I-premise
more I-premise
strict I-premise
rules I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
abstract I-premise
, I-premise
requiring I-premise
creativity I-premise
and I-premise
imagination I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
enriched I-premise
. O

Children B-premise
are I-premise
privileged I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
these I-premise
abilities I-premise
because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
given I-premise
more I-premise
freedom I-premise
and I-premise
their I-premise
imagination I-premise
has I-premise
not I-premise
yet I-premise
been I-premise
killed I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
reality I-premise
circumstances I-premise
. O

Even B-premise
if I-premise
their I-premise
performances I-premise
are I-premise
just I-premise
some I-premise
simple I-premise
drawings I-premise
and I-premise
melodies I-premise
, I-premise
music I-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
still I-premise
bring I-premise
out I-premise
children I-premise
's I-premise
joy I-premise
of I-premise
flying I-premise
in I-premise
imagination I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
music B-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
are I-premise
life I-premise
- I-premise
long I-premise
cultivation I-premise
worthy I-premise
of I-premise
investing I-premise
. O

They B-premise
teach I-premise
us I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
appreciate I-premise
beauty I-premise
and I-premise
express I-premise
feelings I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
creative I-premise
way I-premise
. O

They B-premise
are I-premise
essential I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
spiritual I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
even B-claim
if I-claim
children I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
going I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
great I-claim
musicians I-claim
or I-claim
artists I-claim
, I-claim
learning I-claim
music I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
is I-claim
still I-claim
worthy I-claim
because O
it B-premise
can I-premise
nourish I-premise
your I-premise
temper I-premise
and I-premise
serve I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
leisure I-premise
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
parents B-claim
should I-claim
n't I-claim
put I-claim
so I-claim
much I-claim
stress I-claim
on I-claim
children I-claim
, O
since O
learning B-premise
too I-premise
many I-premise
skills I-premise
seems I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
burden I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-premise
depends I-premise
on I-premise
how I-premise
you I-premise
value I-premise
these I-premise
learning I-premise
activities I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
like I-premise
. O

If B-premise
parents I-premise
push I-premise
their I-premise
5 I-premise
years I-premise
old I-premise
child I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
piano I-premise
8 I-premise
hours I-premise
a I-premise
day I-premise
just I-premise
like I-premise
a I-premise
professional I-premise
performer I-premise
, I-premise
that I-premise
might I-premise
be I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
. O

In B-premise
a I-premise
child I-premise
stage I-premise
, I-premise
music I-premise
and I-premise
art I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
like I-premise
an I-premise
open I-premise
door I-premise
to I-premise
introduce I-premise
the I-premise
art I-premise
world I-premise
than I-premise
training I-premise
area I-premise
to I-premise
acquire I-premise
specific I-premise
skills I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
it B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
be I-premise
such I-premise
pressure I-premise
on I-premise
children I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
young B-claim
age I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
perfect I-claim
time I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
music I-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
and O
they B-claim
are I-claim
indeed I-claim
valuable I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
young I-claim
stage I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
in I-claim
every I-claim
stage I-claim
. O

Music B-claim
and I-claim
art I-claim
can I-claim
accompany I-claim
a I-claim
spirit I-claim
as I-claim
long I-claim
as I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
given I-claim
the I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
enter I-claim
his I-claim
/ I-claim
her I-claim
life I-claim
. O

The O
car O
use O
will O
definitely O
decrease O
in O
twenty O
years O
Views O
differ O
considerably O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
cars O
will O
be O
less O
than O
there O
are O
today O
in O
twenty O
years O
or O
not O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
since O
the O
environmental O
concern O
has O
risen O
, O
the O
car O
use O
will O
decrease O
. O

While O
others O
think O
that O
a O
personal O
car O
is O
important O
for O
ones O
daily O
life O
. O

Both O
of O
the O
opposite O
arguments O
appear O
to O
be O
somewhat O
convincing O
and O
stand O
to O
reason O
. O

But O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
, O
which O
is O
that O
there B-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
decrease I-claim
in I-claim
cars I-claim
use I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
future I-claim
. O

The O
following O
reasons O
will O
present O
my O
points O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
since O
the B-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
has I-premise
improved I-premise
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
much I-claim
convenience I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
a I-claim
subway I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
bus I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
city I-premise
which I-premise
always I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
jam I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
morning I-premise
and I-premise
does I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
enough I-premise
parking I-premise
lots I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
cars I-premise
. O

So O
, O
with B-premise
the I-premise
stations I-premise
increased I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
a I-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
than I-premise
drive I-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
a B-premise
driving I-premise
car I-premise
can I-premise
make I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
different I-premise
pollutions I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

So O
, O
with B-claim
the I-claim
risen I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
aware I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
environment I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
will I-claim
think I-claim
more I-claim
about I-claim
whether I-claim
to I-claim
drive I-claim
on I-claim
their I-claim
own I-claim
or I-claim
not I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
instead B-premise
of I-premise
driving I-premise
each I-premise
one I-premise
's I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
we I-premise
put I-premise
forty I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
bus I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
solve I-premise
the I-premise
traffic I-premise
jam I-premise
by I-premise
decrease I-premise
the I-premise
cars I-premise
use I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
air I-premise
pollution I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
. O

Although O
, O
I O
am O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
reducing O
of O
the O
car O
use O
will O
be O
achieve O
in O
twenty O
years O
. O

I O
think O
I O
still O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
there O
are O
some O
different O
points O
of O
view O
. O

People O
who O
hold O
different O
opinion O
may O
argue O
that O
a B-claim
personal I-claim
car I-claim
uses I-claim
is I-claim
in I-claim
need I-claim
because O
a B-premise
public I-premise
transportation I-premise
ca I-premise
n't I-premise
meet I-premise
every I-premise
place I-premise
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it B-premise
may I-premise
be I-premise
true I-premise
when I-premise
you I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
some I-premise
countryside I-premise
or I-premise
some I-premise
other I-premise
inconvenience I-premise
places I-premise
. O

However O
, O
no B-premise
matter I-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
going I-premise
to I-premise
somewhere I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
trip I-premise

or I-premise
you I-premise
just I-premise
simply I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
suburbs I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
always I-premise
have I-premise
some I-premise
other I-premise
ways I-premise
that I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
do I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
ride I-premise
a I-premise
bike I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
even I-premise
walk I-premise
on I-premise
your I-premise
feet I-premise
. O

It B-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
helps I-premise
you I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
car I-premise
use I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
good I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
health I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
this B-premise
wo I-premise
n't I-premise
be I-premise
a I-premise
problem I-premise
at I-premise
all I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
given O
the O
reasons O
described O
above O
, O
when O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
whether O
there O
will O
be O
fewer O
cars O
in O
use O
in O
twenty O
years O
or O
not O
are O
carefully O
compared O
, O
the O
best O
choice O
is O
obviously O
stand O
on O
my O
side O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the B-claim
car I-claim
use I-claim
will I-claim
definitely I-claim
decrease I-claim
in I-claim
twenty I-claim
years I-claim
. O

Working O
at O
home O
vs O
Working O
in O
a O
company O
Due O
to O
the O
convenience O
of O
current O
technology O
, O
people O
can O
do O
their O
works O
everywhere O
as O
long O
as O
they O
have O
the O
equipment O
around O
them O
. O

People O
are O
no O
longer O
restricted O
in O
the O
office O
. O

This O
rapid O
progress O
in O
technology O
leads O
to O
the O
question O
whether O
it O
's O
better O
working O
at O
home O
with O
a O
computer O
and O
a O
phone O
than O
working O
at O
the O
company O
's O
office O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
working B-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
is I-claim
worse I-claim
and I-claim
less I-claim
efficient I-claim
than I-claim
working I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
office I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
while B-claim
working I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
office I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
can I-claim
interact I-claim
with I-claim
their I-claim
colleges I-claim
instantly I-claim
. O

They B-premise
can I-premise
either I-premise
get I-premise
help I-premise
from I-premise
colleges I-premise
or I-premise
discuss I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
together I-premise
. O

Think B-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
big I-premise
project I-premise
that I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
is I-premise
working I-premise
on I-premise
, I-premise
if I-premise
any I-premise
group I-premise
member I-premise
has I-premise
new I-premise
idea I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
project I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
/ I-premise
she I-premise
can I-premise
assemble I-premise
his I-premise
/ I-premise
her I-premise
colleges I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
and I-premise
discuss I-premise
. O

It B-premise
's I-premise
more I-premise
efficient I-premise
and I-premise
straight I-premise
- I-premise
forward I-premise
than I-premise
talking I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
phone I-premise
. O

For O
another O
example O
, O
if B-premise
one I-premise
’s I-premise
computer I-premise
or I-premise
Internet I-premise
has I-premise
any I-premise
breakdown I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
/ I-premise
she I-premise
can I-premise
call I-premise
the I-premise
MIS I-premise
staff I-premise
to I-premise
fix I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
working B-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
has I-claim
many I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
that I-claim
will I-claim
no I-claim
doubt I-claim
lower I-claim
the I-claim
efficiency I-claim
of I-claim
works I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
people B-premise
are I-premise
easily I-premise
distracted I-premise
while I-premise
working I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
. O

It B-premise
's I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
concentrate I-premise
on I-premise
work I-premise
if I-premise
people I-premise
can I-premise
grab I-premise
the I-premise
TV I-premise
remote I-premise
or I-premise
some I-premise
junk I-premise
foods I-premise
right I-premise
away I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
while B-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
working I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
no I-premise
one I-premise
supervising I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
thus I-premise
raises I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
loafing I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
people B-premise
who I-premise
work I-premise
at I-premise
home I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
miss I-premise
the I-premise
important I-premise
events I-premise
happening I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
office I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
some I-premise
announcements I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
boss I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
working B-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
office I-claim
is I-claim
obviously I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
working I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
efficiency I-claim
. O

It B-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
has I-claim
the I-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
working I-claim
with I-claim
colleges I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
it I-claim
provides I-claim
a I-claim
real I-claim
working I-claim
atmosphere I-claim
that I-claim
can I-claim
never I-claim
be I-claim
grasped I-claim
if I-claim
people I-claim
choose I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
at I-claim
home I-claim
. O

The O
ability O
to O
relate O
well O
to O
people O
is O
more O
important O
I O
think O
that O
No O
factor O
is O
important O
enough O
by O
itself O
to O
succeed O
in O
any O
situations O
. O

We O
should O
consider O
many O
factors O
and O
choose O
the O
best O
of O
them O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
both B-claim
the I-claim
ability I-claim
to I-claim
relate I-claim
well I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
and I-claim
studying I-claim
hard I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
are I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
success I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
future I-claim
job I-claim
for O
following O
reasons O
: O
We B-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
and I-premise
learn I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
theoritical I-premise
basis I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
future I-premise
job I-premise
. O

This B-premise
can I-premise
be I-premise
done I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise
. O

In B-premise
school I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
identify I-premise
skills I-premise
required I-premise
for I-premise
our I-premise
future I-premise
job I-premise
and I-premise
work I-premise
on I-premise
mastering I-premise
and I-premise
learning I-premise
them I-premise
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
study I-premise
them I-premise
hard I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
doing I-premise
our I-premise
job I-premise
better I-premise
and I-premise
quicker I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
someone I-premise
wants I-premise
to I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
good I-premise
industrial I-premise
engineer I-premise
, I-premise
he I-premise
should I-premise
study I-premise
his I-premise
technical I-premise
courses I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
so I-premise
that I-premise
he I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
utilize I-premise
them I-premise
well I-premise
in I-premise
his I-premise
future I-premise
job I-premise
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
studying B-claim
hard I-claim
in I-claim
school I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
important I-claim
factor I-claim
to I-claim
succeed I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
job I-claim
. O

One B-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
other I-premise
factors I-premise
for I-premise
success I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
future I-premise
job I-premise
is I-premise
effective I-premise
commuincation I-premise
. O

By B-premise
relating I-premise
well I-premise
to I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
are I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
friends I-premise
and O
therefore O
we B-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
wide I-premise
network I-premise
of I-premise
communication I-premise
. O

Commuincation B-premise
can I-premise
bring I-premise
many I-premise
benefits I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
need I-premise
help I-premise
with I-premise
getting I-premise
a I-premise
job I-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
commuincating I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
offering I-premise
jobs I-premise
whom I-premise
you I-premise
treat I-premise
well I-premise
and O
therefore O
they B-premise
respect I-premise
you I-premise
as I-premise
well I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
achieve I-premise
your I-premise
goal I-premise
. O

Or O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
salesman I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
store I-premise
or I-premise
any I-premise
other I-premise
place I-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
relating I-premise
well I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
customers I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
increase I-premise
the I-premise
chance I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
coming I-premise
back I-premise
again I-premise
and I-premise
becoming I-premise
your I-premise
regular I-premise
customers I-premise
. O

So O
, O
relating B-claim
well I-claim
to I-claim
people I-claim
is I-claim
also I-claim
another I-claim
important I-claim
factor I-claim
. O

In O
sum O
, O
though O
some O
people O
may O
disagree O
with O
me O
, O
as O
I O
explained O
my O
reasons O
and O
examples O
above O
, O
none O
of O
those O
factors O
are O
important O
and O
sufficient O
enough O
by O
themselves O
and O
we B-claim
should I-claim
notice I-claim
to I-claim
both I-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
because O
each B-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
has I-claim
its I-claim
own I-claim
benefits I-claim
. O

The O
advertising O
is O
the O
main O
cause O
of O
unhealthy O
eating O
habits O
Advertising O
is O
becoming O
part O
of O
our O
modern O
society O
. O

They O
penetrate O
into O
people O
's O
life O
, O
affecting O
people O
's O
choices O
in O
different O
things O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
debate O
whether O
advertising O
has O
positive O
influences O
on O
people O
's O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
that O
advertising O
must O
be O
blamed O
for O
the O
unhealthy O
eating O
habits O
, O
while O
others O
believe O
that O
there O
are O
still O
some O
other O
factors O
directing O
people O
's O
judgments O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the B-claim
advertising I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
main I-claim
cause I-claim
of I-claim
unhealthy I-claim
eating I-claim
habits I-claim
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
advertising B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
entirely I-claim
decisive I-claim
on I-claim
personal I-claim
eating I-claim
habit I-claim
. O

The B-premise
key I-premise
to I-premise
forming I-premise
a I-premise
healthy I-premise
eating I-premise
pattern I-premise
lies I-premise
in I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
concept I-premise
of I-premise
wholesome I-premise
diets I-premise
and I-premise
self I-premise
- I-premise
control I-premise
. O

It O
is O
sure O
that O
advertising B-premise
always I-premise
makes I-premise
the I-premise
products I-premise
so I-premise
tempting I-premise
, I-premise
regardless I-premise
of I-premise
whether I-premise
they I-premise
might I-premise
bring I-premise
negative I-premise
effects I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
human I-premise
body I-premise
. O

However O
, O
advertising B-premise
is I-premise
not I-premise
the I-premise
only I-premise
information I-premise
source I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
still I-premise
acquire I-premise
different I-premise
viewpoints I-premise
about I-premise
foods I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
sources I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
news I-premise
or I-premise
magazines I-premise
. O

As B-premise
long I-premise
as I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
clear I-premise
about I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
a I-premise
healthy I-premise
body I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
persistently I-premise
keep I-premise
track I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
eating I-premise
habits I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
successfully I-premise
prevent I-premise
themselves I-premise
from I-premise
those I-premise
temptations I-premise
. O

It B-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
not I-premise
persuasive I-premise
if I-premise
people I-premise
just I-premise
blame I-premise
the I-premise
advertising I-premise
sector I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
fast I-premise
- I-premise
food I-premise
company I-premise
for I-premise
making I-premise
them I-premise
so I-premise
fat I-premise
and I-premise
not I-premise
reassess I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
behaviors I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
in B-premise
the I-premise
era I-premise
when I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
becoming I-premise
conscious I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
healthier I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
, I-premise
some I-premise
companies I-premise
are I-premise
actually I-premise
aiming I-premise
at I-premise
this I-premise
rising I-premise
trend I-premise
and I-premise
start I-premise
to I-premise
promote I-premise
healthy I-premise
foods I-premise
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
advertising B-claim
may I-claim
even I-claim
bring I-claim
healthier I-claim
eating I-claim
habits I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Think B-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
recently I-premise
popular I-premise
organic I-premise
foods I-premise
that I-premise
are I-premise
claimed I-premise
to I-premise
grow I-premise
in I-premise
an I-premise
environment I-premise
without I-premise
pesticide I-premise
and I-premise
those I-premise
crude I-premise
foods I-premise
in I-premise
which I-premise
less I-premise
salt I-premise
or I-premise
less I-premise
sugar I-premise
are I-premise
added I-premise
. O

These B-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
main I-premise
traits I-premise
that I-premise
advertising I-premise
is I-premise
hitting I-premise
on I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
overall I-premise
results I-premise
are I-premise
good I-premise
. O

In O
these O
cases O
, O
the B-premise
advertising I-premise
industry I-premise
bolsters I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
having I-premise
a I-premise
healthy I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
advertising B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
the I-claim
primary I-claim
reason I-claim
of I-claim
unhealthy I-claim
eating I-claim
habits I-claim
. O

There B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
build I-claim
- I-claim
up I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
concept I-claim
about I-claim
healthy I-claim
eating I-claim
habits I-claim
and I-claim
self I-claim
- I-claim
control I-claim
that I-claim
really I-claim
matter I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
advertising B-claim
might I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
healthier I-claim
eating I-claim
customs I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
growing I-claim
awareness I-claim
of I-claim
living I-claim
under I-claim
a I-claim
better I-claim
lifestyle I-claim
. O

It O
is O
inevitable O
to O
be O
exposed O
to O
the O
environment O
full O
of O
advertisements O
but O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
our O
right O
to O
choose O
is O
taken O
away O
. O

We O
will O
always O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
our O
own O
lifestyles O
. O

Learning O
facts O
has O
more O
subsequent O
advantages O
for O

There O
are O
many O
debates O
regarding O
whether O
understanding O
ideas O

concepts O
is O
more O
essential O
than O
learning O
facts O
for O
students O
or O
not O
. O

Although O
multitudes O

people O
think O
that O
knowledge O
of O
ideas O

concepts O
is O
more O
vital O
for O
students O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
conviction O

learning B-claim
facts I-claim
has I-claim
more I-claim
subsequent I-claim
advantages I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
future I-claim
lives I-claim

In O
the O
following O

I O
will O
state O
my O
reasons O
for O
this O
choice O
. O

First O
, O
when B-premise
students I-premise
learn I-premise
facts I-premise
more I-premise
in I-premise
school I-premise

they I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
ready I-premise
for I-premise

problems I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
own I-premise
life I-premise
after I-premise
their I-premise
graduations I-premise
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
more B-premise
information I-premise
about I-premise
facts I-premise
would I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
more I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
life I-premise
other I-premise
that I-premise
only I-premise
their I-premise
concepts I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they B-claim
would I-claim
prepare I-claim
to I-claim
encounter I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
out I-claim
of I-claim
school I-claim
to I-claim
solve I-claim
their I-claim

better I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
it B-claim
would I-claim
improve I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
social I-claim
behavior I-claim
. O

If B-premise
students I-premise
only I-premise
rely I-premise
on I-premise
concepts I-premise
and I-premise
ideas I-premise
theorically I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
not I-premise
realize I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
mind I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
. O

They B-premise
should I-premise
understand I-premise
objects I-premise
more I-premise
that I-premise
concepts I-premise
to I-premise
obtain I-premise
the I-premise
ability I-premise
of I-premise
analyzing I-premise
matters I-premise
well I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
if B-premise
they I-premise
deal I-premise
more I-premise
with I-premise
facts I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
realize I-premise
social I-premise
situations I-premise
effectively I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
social I-premise
communication I-premise
in I-premise
everyday I-premise
life I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
these B-premise
way I-premise
students I-premise
are I-premise
teached I-premise
to I-premise
control I-premise
their I-premise
fears I-premise
and I-premise
concerns I-premise
in I-premise
facing I-premise
facts I-premise
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
when B-claim
a I-claim
student I-claim
understands I-claim
a I-claim
fact I-claim
and I-claim
its I-claim
consequences I-claim
, I-claim
he I-claim
or I-claim
she I-claim
can I-claim
encounter I-claim
it I-claim
more I-claim
confidently I-claim
. O

In O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
concerns B-premise
and I-premise
anxieties I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
destructive I-premise
in I-premise
everybody I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
. O

It B-premise
can I-premise
prevent I-premise
person I-premise
to I-premise
progress I-premise
and I-premise
thrive I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
position I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
learning B-claim
facts I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
beneficial I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
in I-claim
both I-claim
social I-claim
and I-claim
individual I-claim
life I-claim
in O
the O
view O
of O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
. O

Students B-claim
would I-claim
improve I-claim
their I-claim
social I-claim
positions I-claim
and I-claim
encounter I-claim
their I-claim
problems I-claim
in I-claim
positive I-claim
ways I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
intend I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
more I-claim
confidence I-claim
manner I-claim
and I-claim
etc I-claim
. O

Financial O
support O
for O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
debates O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O
in O
contrast O
with O
the O
main O
classes O
. O

It O
is O
very O
subjective O
decision O
for O
students O
to O
have O
or O
not O
have O
these O
facilities O
. O

Although O
multitudes O
of O
people O
think O
that O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O
are O
not O
as O
necessary O
as O
academic O
subjects O
in O
colleges O
, O
I O
think O
that O
these B-claim
activities I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
efficient I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
lives I-claim
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
I O
will O
state O
my O
reason O
for O
this O
choice O
. O

First O
, O
besides B-premise
the I-premise
good I-premise
body I-premise
shape I-premise
, I-premise
sports I-premise
have I-premise
very I-premise
vital I-premise
effects I-premise
on I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
healthfulness I-premise
. O

In O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
our B-premise
body I-premise
and I-premise
moral I-premise
health I-premise
depend I-premise
to I-premise
physical I-premise
activities I-premise
directly I-premise
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
last B-premise
month I-premise
I I-premise
had I-premise
very I-premise
difficult I-premise
exam I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
forced I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
for I-premise
one I-premise
week I-premise
back I-premise
to I-premise
back I-premise
. O

After B-premise
that I-premise
exam I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
felt I-premise
depressed I-premise
and I-premise
exhausted I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
I B-premise
decided I-premise
to I-premise
go I-premise
to I-premise
gym I-premise
to I-premise
recuperate I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
responded I-premise
very I-premise
well I-premise
! O

As O
a O
result O
, O
sports B-claim
are I-claim
necessary I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
acquire I-claim
their I-claim
energy I-claim
and I-claim
health I-claim
. O

Second O
, O
besides B-premise
the I-premise
academic I-premise
knowledge I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
awareness I-premise
of I-premise
social I-premise
behavior I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
important I-premise
factor I-premise
for I-premise
human I-premise
's I-premise
life I-premise
. O

As O
a O
practical O
epitome O
, O
students B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
prepared I-premise
to I-premise
present I-premise
in I-premise
society I-premise
after I-premise
their I-premise
graduation I-premise
. O

Thus O
social B-premise
activities I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
's I-premise
mind I-premise
and I-premise
different I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
social B-premise
groups I-premise
and I-premise
classes I-premise
are I-premise
significant I-premise
factors I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
students I-premise
to I-premise
contribute I-premise
in I-premise
discussion I-premise
and I-premise
encounter I-premise
real I-premise
social I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

So O
, O
social B-claim
activities I-claim
have I-claim
same I-claim
rights I-claim
to I-claim
receive I-claim
monetary I-claim
support I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-claim
bring I-claim
about I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
happier I-claim
and I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
fun I-claim
and I-claim
entertainments I-claim
. O

If B-premise
we I-premise
follow I-premise
just I-premise
one I-premise
wing I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
life I-premise
i.e. I-premise
, I-premise
studying I-premise
as I-premise
a I-premise
student I-premise
, I-premise
after I-premise
some I-premise
whiles I-premise
it I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
boring I-premise
and I-premise
we I-premise
would I-premise
n't I-premise
have I-premise
any I-premise
motivation I-premise
. O

Such B-premise
activities I-premise
can I-premise
help I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
pick I-premise
up I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
students I-premise
and I-premise
have I-premise
more I-premise
friends I-premise
. O

In O
my O
perspective O
, O
more B-premise
friends I-premise
and I-premise
new I-premise
experience I-premise
inspire I-premise
the I-premise
feeling I-premise
of I-premise
happiness I-premise
and I-premise
excitement I-premise
in I-premise
me I-premise
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
conviction O
that O
sports B-claim
and I-claim
social I-claim
activities I-claim
should I-claim
obtain I-claim
analogous I-claim
concern I-claim
and I-claim
money I-claim
in O
the O
view O
of O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
. O

They B-claim
bring I-claim
a I-claim
lot I-claim
of I-claim
advantages I-claim
and I-claim
benefits I-claim
for I-claim
students I-claim
and I-claim
also I-claim
affect I-claim
their I-claim
future I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
in O
my O
own O
country O
or O
another O
country O
Knowing O
foreign O
language O
is O
became O
more O
and O
more O
important O
in O
this O
time O
. O

Many O
people O
pursue O
to O
study O
foreign O
language O
. O

There O
are O
two O
options O
to O
learn O
foreign O
language O
. O

First O
is O
stay O
in O
homeland O
to O
study O
foreign O
language O
. O

The O
second O
option O
is O
that O
go O
to O
study O
in O
another O
place O
that O
foreign O
language O
are O
spoken O
. O

Going B-claim
to I-claim
another I-claim
place I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
language I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
choice I-claim
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
going B-claim
to I-claim
another I-claim
country I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
language I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
good I-claim
environment I-claim
to I-claim
stimulate I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
learn I-claim
language I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
everyone B-premise
around I-premise
me I-premise
speaks I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
then I-premise
I I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
myself I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
. O

If B-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
other I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
even I-premise
buy I-premise
food I-premise
to I-premise
sacrifice I-premise
my I-premise
hunger I-premise
. O

This B-premise
environment I-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
develop I-premise
myself I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
that I-premise
speak I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
having B-claim
friend I-claim
that I-claim
speaks I-claim
another I-claim
language I-claim
is I-claim
help I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
professional I-claim
in I-claim
that I-claim
language I-claim
faster I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
English B-premise
school I-premise
in I-premise
outside I-premise
my I-premise
home I-premise
country I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
people I-premise
that I-premise
come I-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
places I-premise
and I-premise
from I-premise
different I-premise
languages I-premise
. O

The B-premise
only I-premise
language I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
talk I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
friends I-premise
is I-premise
English I-premise
language I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I B-premise
could I-premise
talk I-premise
with I-premise
my I-premise
friend I-premise
without I-premise
worrying I-premise
about I-premise
speaking I-premise
wrong I-premise
. O

This B-premise
reason I-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
progress I-premise
in I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
faster I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
believe O
that O
learning B-claim
language I-claim
from I-claim
foreign I-claim
country I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
than I-claim
learning I-claim
language I-claim
in I-claim
home I-claim
country I-claim
because O
I B-claim
have I-claim
to I-claim
improve I-claim
myself I-claim
to I-claim
communicate I-claim
with I-claim
other I-claim
people I-claim
. O

Besides O
, O
in B-claim
foreign I-claim
country I-claim
I I-claim
could I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
speak I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
with I-claim
my I-claim
friends I-claim
. O

Learning B-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
form I-claim
another I-claim
country I-claim
is I-claim
better I-claim
choice I-claim
for I-claim
me I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
language I-claim
. O

Getting O
opinions O
from O
many O

Getting O
opinions O
from O
many O
sources O
could O
augment O
people O
's O
performance O
. O

Thereby O
, O
evaluating O
from O
students O
is O
one O
of O
the O
ways O
to O
improve O
quality O
of O
educational O
system O
. O

Not O
only O
teachers O
could O
amplify O
their O
performance O
but O
the O
whole O
education O
system O
are O
also O
improve O
performance O
from O
evaluation O
made O
by O
students O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
notion O
that O
students B-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
asked I-claim
to I-claim
evaluate I-claim
their I-claim
teachers I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
Evaluating B-premise
teachers I-premise
made I-premise
by I-premise
students I-premise
could I-premise
improve I-premise
teachers I-premise
' I-premise
performance I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
evaluation B-premise
made I-premise
by I-premise
students I-premise
is I-premise
similar I-premise
to I-premise
feedback I-premise
from I-premise
customer I-premise
that I-premise
business I-premise
owners I-premise
need I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
product I-premise
. O

Students B-premise
might I-premise
complain I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
teachers I-premise
spoke I-premise
too I-premise
fast I-premise
that I-premise
students I-premise
could I-premise
not I-premise
catch I-premise
up I-premise
on I-premise
information I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
teachers B-premise
could I-premise
improve I-premise
themselves I-premise
by I-premise
speaking I-premise
slower I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
sure I-premise
that I-premise
students I-premise
could I-premise
get I-premise
all I-premise
information I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
give I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
evaluating B-claim
from I-claim
students I-claim
could I-claim
improve I-claim
teachers I-claim
' I-claim
performance I-claim
. O

Additionally O
, O
this B-claim
evaluation I-claim
from I-claim
students I-claim
could I-claim
improve I-claim
schools I-claim
' I-claim
quality I-claim
. O

Teachers B-premise
could I-premise
augment I-premise
their I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
When B-premise
school I-premise
gather I-premise
teachers I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
great I-premise
performance I-premise
, I-premise
school I-premise
are I-premise
gaining I-premise
higher I-premise
quality I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in B-premise
many I-premise
cooperation I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Microsoft I-premise
that I-premise
could I-premise
produce I-premise
many I-premise
great I-premise
products I-premise
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
employees I-premise
whose I-premise
performance I-premise
are I-premise
very I-premise
high I-premise
. O

Schools B-premise
could I-premise
produce I-premise
intellectual I-premise
students I-premise
because O
school B-premise
have I-premise
teachers I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
improve I-premise
their I-premise
quality I-premise
from I-premise
evaluation I-premise
made I-premise
by I-premise
students I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
people B-claim
who I-claim
get I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
advantage I-claim
from I-claim
evaluation I-claim
is I-claim
students I-claim
. O

Students B-premise
could I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
class I-premise
that I-premise
have I-premise
teachers I-premise
who I-premise
have I-premise
experienced I-premise
and I-premise
greater I-premise
performance I-premise
. O

Because O
teachers B-premise
are I-premise
always I-premise
adapt I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
they I-premise
teach I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
their I-premise
subjects I-premise
, O
students B-premise
could I-premise
comprehend I-premise
their I-premise
subject I-premise
easily I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students B-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
study I-premise
from I-premise
great I-premise
schools I-premise
which I-premise
have I-premise
great I-premise
performance I-premise
teacher I-premise
, I-premise
graduate I-premise
with I-premise
great I-premise
knowledge I-premise
to I-premise
survive I-premise
in I-premise
next I-premise
steps I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
statement O
that O
school B-claim
should I-claim
ask I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
evaluate I-claim
their I-claim
teachers I-claim
because O
teachers B-claim
could I-claim
improve I-claim
their I-claim
performance I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
schools B-claim
are I-claim
also I-claim
improve I-claim
their I-claim
quality I-claim
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
high I-premise
performance I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students B-premise
are I-premise
easy I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
their I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
there B-claim
are I-claim
benefits I-claim
to I-claim
ask I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
evaluate I-claim
their I-claim
teachers I-claim
. O

Keep O
trying O
and O
never O
stop O
working O
for O
your O
goals O
" O
Keep O
running O
! O
, O
" O
shouted O
from O
my O
heart O
but O
my O
legs O
can O
hardly O
move O
. O

During O
running O
for O
20 O
Kilometers O
in O
a O
marathon O
running O
tournament O
2014 O
, O
I O
saw O
some O
people O
stopped O
running O
while O
the O
others O
fought O
until O
their O
last O
minute O
. O

At O
some O
moment O
, O
my O
body O
was O
telling O
me O
to O
stop O
but O
the O
choice O
that O
I O
made O
was O
on O
the O
contrary O
. O

I O
did O
not O
stop O
and O
won O
a O
medal O
goals O
in O
my O
life O
at O
the O
age O
of O
nearly O
thirty O
. O

From O
this O
experience O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
a B-claim
person I-claim
should I-claim
keep I-claim
trying I-claim
for I-claim
his I-claim
goals I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
committing B-claim
to I-claim
our I-claim
goal I-claim
helps I-claim
creating I-claim
personal I-claim
worth I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
realized I-premise
the I-premise
true I-premise
potential I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
body I-premise
and I-premise
mind I-premise
as I-premise
I I-premise
decided I-premise
to I-premise
train I-premise
myself I-premise
hard I-premise
. O

Even B-premise
if I-premise
I I-premise
were I-premise
not I-premise
to I-premise
win I-premise
this I-premise
medal I-premise
, I-premise
I I-premise
acknowledged I-premise
the I-premise
great I-premise
amount I-premise
of I-premise
my I-premise
endeavor I-premise
as I-premise
I I-premise
could I-premise
keep I-premise
my I-premise
tired I-premise
legs I-premise
running I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
one B-claim
who I-claim
learns I-claim
the I-claim
great I-claim
difficulty I-claim
will I-claim
become I-claim
stronger I-claim
. O

I B-premise
remembered I-premise
how I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
suffered I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
round I-premise
when I-premise
I I-premise
was I-premise
last I-premise
person I-premise
who I-premise
touched I-premise
the I-premise
line I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I B-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
give I-premise
up I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
believed I-premise
that I-premise
I I-premise
would I-premise
be I-premise
better I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
next I-premise
round I-premise
because O
I B-premise
knew I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
improve I-premise
myself I-premise
. O

I B-premise
had I-premise
been I-premise
a I-premise
loser I-premise
for I-premise
a I-premise
thousand I-premise
time I-premise
before I-premise
the I-premise
first I-premise
winning I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
suffering I-premise
from I-premise
losing I-premise
in I-premise
each I-premise
competition I-premise
makes I-premise
me I-premise
stronger I-premise
. O

Thirdly O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
we B-premise
, I-premise
as I-premise
an I-premise
average I-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
might I-premise
feel I-premise
that I-premise
the I-premise
responsibility I-premise
to I-premise
our I-premise
goal I-premise
is I-premise
too I-premise
heavy I-premise
to I-premise
carry I-premise
on I-premise
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
responsibility I-claim
is I-claim
worthy I-claim
of I-claim
carrying I-claim
. O

When B-premise
the I-premise
distance I-premise
is I-premise
longer I-premise
and I-premise
harder I-premise
to I-premise
achieve I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
runner I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
go I-premise
beyond I-premise
his I-premise
limit I-premise
will I-premise
proud I-premise
of I-premise
himself I-premise
. O

He B-premise
can I-premise
feel I-premise
the I-premise
sweetness I-premise
of I-premise
triumph I-premise
because O
he B-premise
did I-premise
not I-premise
stop I-premise
pursing I-premise
his I-premise
goal I-premise
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
one B-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
give I-claim
up I-claim
, O
as O
the B-claim
true I-claim
reward I-claim
is I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
dignity I-claim
. O

Anyone B-claim
who I-claim
wants I-claim
to I-claim
achieve I-claim
the I-claim
goal I-claim
should I-claim
acknowledge I-claim
that I-claim
his I-claim
effort I-claim
and I-claim
experience I-claim
from I-claim
suffering I-claim
helps I-claim
him I-claim
understand I-claim
his I-claim
true I-claim
potential I-claim
and I-claim
increase I-claim
his I-claim
strength I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
ultimately I-claim
, I-claim
it I-claim
will I-claim
prompt I-claim
him I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
ready I-claim
for I-claim
overcoming I-claim
the I-claim
greater I-claim
challenge I-claim
in I-claim
his I-claim
life I-claim
. O

Technology O
makes O
people O
's O
lives O
simpler O
rather O
than O
complicated O

Believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
nowadays O
people O
are O
always O
confronted O
with O
a O
problem O
that O
whether O
technology O
makes O
their O
life O
simpler O
or O
not O
, O
thus O
making O
them O
confused O
. O

Many O
people O
advocate O
that O
technology O
makes O
their O
life O
easier O
. O

Although O
I O
conceded O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
complicated I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
aspects I-claim
, O
the B-claim
convenience I-claim
it I-claim
brings I-claim
is I-claim
more I-claim
. O

In O
what O
follows O
, O
I O
will O
illustrate O
my O
point O
of O
view O
. O

First O
, O
when B-claim
it I-claim
comes I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
field I-claim
of I-claim
transportation I-claim
, I-claim
there I-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
doubt I-claim
that I-claim
the I-claim
technology I-claim
in I-claim
automobile I-claim
has I-claim
made I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
simpler I-claim
. O

With B-premise
a I-premise
private I-premise
car I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
can I-premise
reach I-premise
the I-premise
destination I-premise
in I-premise
another I-premise
city I-premise
just I-premise
sitting I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
vehicle I-premise
. O

Alternatively O
, O
if B-premise
you I-premise
would I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
trip I-premise
across I-premise
the I-premise
ocean I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
plane I-premise
can I-premise
carry I-premise
you I-premise
there I-premise
in I-premise
only I-premise
a I-premise
few I-premise
hours I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
imagine I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
ancient I-premise
times I-premise
. O

Second O
, O
technology B-claim
also I-claim
makes I-claim
teaching I-claim
simpler I-claim
. O

In B-premise
the I-premise
past I-premise
, I-premise
teachers I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
write I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
convey I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
chalkboard I-premise
, I-premise
resulting I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
waste I-premise
of I-premise
time I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
fatigue I-premise
of I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

With B-premise
the I-premise
advent I-premise
of I-premise
iPads I-premise
in I-premise
e I-premise
- I-premise
learning I-premise
, I-premise
paper I-premise
books I-premise
become I-premise
unnecessary I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
does I-premise
the I-premise
blackboards I-premise
, O
it O
is O
because O
all B-premise
the I-premise
knowledge I-premise
and I-premise
information I-premise
are I-premise
stored I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
iPads I-premise
, I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
single I-premise
click I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
would I-premise
appear I-premise
right I-premise
before I-premise
your I-premise
eyes I-premise
at I-premise
once I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
more I-claim
complicated I-claim
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-premise
cell I-premise
phone I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
be I-premise
simply I-premise
a I-premise
tool I-premise
to I-premise
deliver I-premise
messages I-premise
to I-premise
your I-premise
contacts I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
distance I-premise
, I-premise
now I-premise
are I-premise
playing I-premise
a I-premise
role I-premise
more I-premise
than I-premise
just I-premise
a I-premise
phone I-premise
in I-premise
social I-premise
communications I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
folks B-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
check I-premise
their I-premise
Facebooks I-premise
, I-premise
Twitters I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
Forums I-premise
accounts I-premise
every I-premise
minute I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
add I-premise
too I-premise
much I-premise
pressure I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
games B-premise
on I-premise
their I-premise
phone I-premise
exert I-premise
a I-premise
tremendous I-premise
fascination I-premise
on I-premise
teenagers I-premise
, I-premise
leading I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
problem I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
got I-premise
addicted I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
phones I-premise
. O

Consequently O
, O
making B-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
more I-premise
complicated I-premise
and I-premise
tired I-premise
. O

Based O
on O
the O
factors O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
a O
conclusion O
can O
be O
drawn O
that O
although O
technology B-claim
may I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
life I-claim
complicated I-claim
in I-claim
some I-claim
cases I-claim
, O
the B-claim
convenience I-claim
it I-claim
brings I-claim
in I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
are I-claim
significant I-claim
. O

More O

Organizations O

these O

These O
people O
play O
an O

a O

Working B-claim

Trying B-claim

learn I-claim

working I-claim
in I-claim
two I-claim
places I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
week I-claim
and I-claim
gaining I-claim

are I-claim
the I-claim
reasons I-claim
which I-claim
take I-claim
into I-claim
account I-claim
as I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
important I-claim
causes I-claim

my I-claim

To O
begin O
with O
, O
if B-claim
persons I-claim
work I-claim
rapidly I-claim
, I-claim
they I-claim
will I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim

Attending B-premise

some I-premise
classes I-premise
which I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
increase I-premise
the I-premise
skills I-premise

an I-premise
absolutely I-premise

If B-premise
people I-premise
learn I-premise
how I-premise

they I-premise
can I-premise
stares I-premise

their I-premise

For O
example O
, O
I B-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
friend I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
working I-premise
so I-premise
slowly I-premise
. O

He B-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
threatened I-premise

his I-premise
boss I-premise
who I-premise
was I-premise
going I-premise

fire I-premise
him I-premise

My B-premise
friend I-premise
went I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
course I-premise
where I-premise
he I-premise
learned I-premise
how I-premise
should I-premise
work I-premise
rapidly I-premise

and I-premise
now I-premise
he I-premise
is I-premise
working I-premise
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
people B-claim
prone I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
in I-claim
two I-claim
or I-claim
three I-claim
firms I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
week I-claim
because O
the B-premise
expenses I-premise
have I-premise
been I-premise
increased I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
work I-premise
just I-premise
in I-premise
one I-premise
organization I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
earn I-premise
enough I-premise
money I-premise
. O

This B-premise
fact I-premise
pushes I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
work I-premise
faster I-premise
and I-premise
faster I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
because O
applying B-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
abroad I-premise
needs I-premise
a I-premise
lot I-premise
of I-premise
money I-premise
, O
I B-premise
am I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
two I-premise
organization I-premise

The B-premise
more I-premise
money I-premise

the I-premise

Last O
but O
not O

, O
people B-claim
who I-claim

If B-premise
you I-premise

that I-premise
you I-premise

the I-premise
one I-premise
who I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
more I-premise

other I-premise
even I-premise
carelessly I-premise
, I-premise
your I-premise
boss I-premise
will I-premise

you I-premise
more I-premise

If B-premise
you I-premise
do I-premise
them I-premise
fast I-premise

the I-premise
first I-premise
acknowledgement I-premise
of I-premise
your I-premise

you I-premise

To O
sum O
up O

I O
completely O
approve O

people B-claim

Gaining B-claim

these O

The O
necessity O

extremely O
important O

What B-claim
government I-claim
should I-claim
take I-claim
into I-claim
consideration I-claim
at I-claim
the I-claim
first I-claim
place I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
historic I-claim

traditional I-claim
building I-claim
preservation I-claim
but I-claim
new I-claim
building I-claim
construction I-claim
. O

Building B-claim
more I-claim
accommodating I-claim
constructions I-claim
meets I-claim
people I-claim
's I-claim
basic I-claim
need I-claim
. O

People B-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
live I-premise
a I-premise
harmonious I-premise
life I-premise
if I-premise
citizens I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
decent I-premise
place I-premise

live I-premise
in I-premise

If B-premise
the I-premise
price I-premise

housing I-premise
grows I-premise
continuously I-premise
, I-premise
a I-premise
comfortable I-premise
place I-premise

be I-premise
a I-premise
luxury I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
middle I-premise
class I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
low I-premise
class I-premise
. O

Then O
, O
ordinary B-premise
people I-premise
, I-premise
especially I-premise
the I-premise
younger I-premise
generation I-premise

will I-premise
fall I-premise
into I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
pattern I-premise

work I-premise

pay I-premise
bills I-premise

work I-premise
; I-premise
and I-premise
I I-premise
am I-premise
sure I-premise
that I-premise
it I-premise
will I-premise
increase I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
dissatisfaction I-premise

the I-premise

Because O
when B-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
working I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
fair I-premise

losing I-premise
their I-premise
accommodation I-premise
always I-premise
lingers I-premise

which I-premise

limit I-premise
their I-premise
efficiency I-premise
. O

And O
government B-premise
should I-premise
spend I-premise
money I-premise
on I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
rescue I-premise
them I-premise
from I-premise
this I-premise
, O
because O
only B-premise
a I-premise
government I-premise

the I-premise
people I-premise

by I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise

for I-premise
the I-premise
people I-premise

finally I-premise
last I-premise

people I-premise
's I-premise
cohesiveness I-premise

be I-premise
promoted I-premise
. O

Otherwise O
, O
another O
vital O
reason O
why O
new B-claim
building I-claim
construction I-claim
deserves I-claim
more I-claim
governmental I-claim
investment I-claim
lies O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
it B-premise
requires I-premise
far I-premise
more I-premise
resource I-premise
compare I-premise

old I-premise
building I-premise
preservation I-premise
. O

Build B-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
building I-premise
has I-premise
following I-premise
prerequisites I-premise
, I-premise
land I-premise
that I-premise
has I-premise
been I-premise
sold I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise

formal I-premise

tremendous I-premise
amount I-premise

Except O
these O
, O
hundreds B-premise
of I-premise
problems I-premise
would I-premise
occur I-premise
during I-premise

Thus O
, O
only B-premise

can I-premise
cope I-premise

it I-premise
by I-premise
utilizing I-premise
its I-premise
enormous I-premise

Generally O
, O
personally O
speaking O

I O
believe O
new B-claim

hold I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim

The B-claim

. O

By B-premise
investigating I-premise
about I-premise
their I-premise
structures I-premise
, I-premise
we I-premise
can I-premise
understand I-premise
how I-premise
much I-premise
they I-premise
knew I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
architecture I-premise
of I-premise
building I-premise
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
historic B-premise
buildings I-premise
are I-premise
important I-premise
treasures I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
provide I-premise
an I-premise
area I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
valuable I-premise
lessons I-premise
. O

Another B-claim
advantage I-claim
of I-claim
historic I-claim
buildings I-claim
is I-claim
their I-claim
capabilities I-claim
to I-claim
attract I-claim
more I-claim
tourists I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
city I-claim
. O

It B-premise
is I-premise
interesting I-premise
for I-premise
most I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
know I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
way I-premise
people I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
thousands I-premise
years I-premise
ago I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
It B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
valuable I-premise
opportunities I-premise
for I-premise
any I-premise
city I-premise
having I-premise
historic I-premise
buildings I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
new I-premise
visitors I-premise
. O

Historic B-premise
building I-premise
can I-premise
develop I-premise
other I-premise
industries I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
restaurants I-premise
or I-premise
other I-premise
food I-premise
industries I-premise
and I-premise
handicrafts I-premise
shops I-premise
and I-premise
so I-premise
on I-premise
. O

These O
are O
reasons O
that O
why O
we B-claim
should I-claim
preserve I-claim
historic I-claim
buildings I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
city I-claim
. O

They B-claim
can I-claim
benefit I-claim
us I-claim
financially I-claim
by I-claim
developing I-claim
other I-claim
industries I-claim
. O

Moreover O
, O
they B-claim
are I-claim
the I-claim
symbols I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
nations I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
can I-claim
show I-claim
the I-claim
historical I-claim
culture I-claim
of I-claim
our I-claim
previous I-claim
ancestors I-claim
. O

Attending O
boys O
and O
girls O
in O
a O
same O
school O
would O
bring O
many O
advantages O
Women O
or O
men O
almost O
need O
each O
other O
in O
full O
of O
life O
even O
in O
school O
. O

Although O
some O
experts O
believe O
that O
common O
schools O
for O
both O
female O
and O
male O
lead O
to O
diminish O
their O
efficiency O
in O
education O
, O
others O
view O
it O
as O
a O
helpful O
way O
to O
recognize O
the O
opposite O
gender O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
boys B-claim
and I-claim
girls I-claim
should I-claim
study I-claim
together I-claim
in O
the O
sense O
that O
they B-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
and I-claim
learn I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
behave I-claim
with I-claim
an I-claim
opposite I-claim
sex I-claim
. O

School B-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
small I-premise
society I-premise
for I-premise
students I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
prepares I-premise
them I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
future I-premise
life I-premise
. O

By B-claim
attending I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
school I-claim
, I-claim
students I-claim
can I-claim
learn I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
view I-claim
the I-claim
opposite I-claim
gender I-claim
in I-claim
classes I-claim
as I-claim
a I-claim
friend I-claim
or I-claim
a I-claim
classmate I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-premise
boy I-premise
would I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
speak I-premise
with I-premise
a I-premise
girl I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
situation I-premise
and I-premise
vice I-premise
versa I-premise
. O

They B-premise
would I-premise
know I-premise
how I-premise
to I-premise
ask I-premise
her I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
cooperate I-premise
with I-premise
his I-premise
study I-premise
, I-premise
how I-premise
communicate I-premise
with I-premise
girls I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
group I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

Admittedly O
, O
when B-premise
they I-premise
study I-premise
together I-premise
and I-premise
help I-premise
each I-premise
other I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
exercise I-premise
the I-premise
the I-premise
real I-premise
life I-premise
as I-premise
they I-premise
age I-premise
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
some O
experts O
believe O
that O
attending B-premise
both I-premise
girls I-premise
and I-premise
boys I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
same I-premise
school I-premise
cause I-premise
many I-premise
disadvantages I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
outdoors B-premise
relationships I-premise
may I-premise
expand I-premise
and I-premise
it I-premise
may I-premise
accompany I-premise
with I-premise
sexual I-premise
relationship I-premise
and O
as O
result O
, O
their B-premise
thoughts I-premise
deviate I-premise
from I-premise
the I-premise
studies I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
attending B-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
school I-claim
having I-claim
boys I-claim
and I-claim
girls I-claim
might I-claim
be I-claim
beneficial I-claim
for I-claim
both I-claim
to I-claim
increase I-claim
their I-claim
motivation I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
better I-claim
. O

Boys B-premise
and I-premise
girls I-premise
will I-premise
try I-premise
to I-premise
show I-premise
their I-premise
capabilities I-premise
and I-premise
abilities I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
, O
therefore O
they B-premise
will I-premise
study I-premise
increasingly I-premise
. O

Indeed O
, O
Boys B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
seem I-premise
weak I-premise
in I-premise
front I-premise
of I-premise
girls I-premise
and I-premise
vice I-premise
versa I-premise
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the B-premise
productivity I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
class I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
increased I-premise
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
attending B-claim
boys I-claim
and I-claim
girls I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
same I-claim
school I-claim
would I-claim
bring I-claim
many I-claim
advantages I-claim
. O

Taking B-claim
part I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
study I-claim
groups I-claim
would I-claim
increase I-claim
student I-claim
's I-claim
motivation I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
more I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they B-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
the I-claim
opposite I-claim
gender I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
prepared I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
adult I-claim
life I-claim
where I-claim
they I-claim
almost I-claim
will I-claim
live I-claim
or I-claim
work I-claim
together I-claim
. O

The O
city O
which O
I O
enjoy O
the O
most O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
history O
and O
modernity O
The O
city O
where O
I O
was O
born O
used O
to O
be O
of O
a O
great O
antique O
beauty O
, O
which O
was O
surrounded O
with O
by O
lots O
of O
ancient O
style O
buildings O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
urbanization O
makes O
me O
only O
appreciate O
parts O
of O
those O
classic O
buildings O
in O
the O
pictures O
or O
in O
museums O
. O

In O
order O
to O
prevent O
the O
disappearance O
of O
the O
historic O
buildings O
, O
some O
citizens O
suggest O
the O
government O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
historic O
buildings O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
we B-claim
should I-claim
do I-claim
our I-claim
parts I-claim
to I-claim
do I-claim
what I-claim
ever I-claim
it I-claim
takes I-claim
to I-claim
protect I-claim
old I-claim
buildings I-claim
, I-claim
letting I-claim
next I-claim
generations I-claim
still I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
chance I-claim
to I-claim
look I-claim
at I-claim
them I-claim
. O

Here O
are O
some O
reasons O
and O
examples O
to O
illustrate O
my O
viewpoint O
. O

Historic B-claim
buildings I-claim
have I-claim
intrinsic I-claim
values I-claim
, O
because O
they B-premise
are I-premise
significant I-premise
symbols I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
city I-premise
. O

Old B-premise
buildings I-premise
are I-premise
reminders I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
city I-premise
's I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
complexity I-premise
. O

By B-premise
seeing I-premise
historic I-premise
buildings I-premise
-- I-premise
whether I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
something I-premise
famous I-premise
or I-premise
recognizably I-premise
dramatic I-premise
, I-premise
people I-premise
are I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
witness I-premise
the I-premise
aesthetic I-premise
and I-premise
cultural I-premise
history I-premise
of I-premise
an I-premise
area I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
when B-premise
somebody I-premise
mentions I-premise
Beijing I-premise
, I-premise
China I-premise
's I-premise
capital I-premise
city I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
will I-premise
immediately I-premise
have I-premise
Capital I-premise
Palace I-premise
come I-premise
to I-premise
appear I-premise
in I-premise
your I-premise
mind I-premise
, O
because O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
remarkable I-premise
sign I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
city I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
also I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
inevitable I-premise
history I-premise
of I-premise
Beijing I-premise
, I-premise
even I-premise
the I-premise
entire I-premise
China I-premise
. O

Depending B-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
study I-premise
of I-premise
Capital I-premise
Palace I-premise
, I-premise
researchers I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
comprehensive I-premise
understanding I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
history I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
historic B-claim
buildings I-claim
make I-claim
our I-claim
lives I-claim
more I-claim
colorful I-claim
, I-claim
provide I-claim
places I-claim
for I-claim
citizens I-claim
to I-claim
relax I-claim
bodies I-claim
and I-claim
minds I-claim
. O

The B-premise
city I-premise
is I-premise
occupied I-premise
with I-premise
an I-premise
abundance I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
houses I-premise
and I-premise
and I-premise
high I-premise
buildings I-premise
which I-premise
make I-premise
it I-premise
crowded I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
no I-premise
rooms I-premise
for I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
relax I-premise
themselves I-premise
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
warmth I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
materials I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
heart I-premise
pine I-premise
, I-premise
marble I-premise
, I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
old I-premise
brick I-premise
, I-premise
all I-premise
those I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
features I-premise
call I-premise
back I-premise
of I-premise
our I-premise
inner I-premise
peace I-premise
. O

Lying B-premise
under I-premise
the I-premise
roof I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
historic I-premise
building I-premise
or I-premise
sitting I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
desk I-premise
fill I-premise
with I-premise
history I-premise
are I-premise
both I-premise
easy I-premise
ways I-premise
to I-premise
forget I-premise
life I-premise
's I-premise
little I-premise
annoyance I-premise
and I-premise
feel I-premise
peaceful I-premise
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
historic B-claim
buildings I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
source I-claim
of I-claim
maintenance I-claim
fees I-claim
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
many I-premise
historic I-premise
buildings I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
Beijing I-premise
Place I-premise
, I-premise
Shanghai I-premise
Artist I-premise
Museum I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
all I-premise
able I-premise
to I-premise
support I-premise
themselves I-premise
financially I-premise
by I-premise
charging I-premise
tens I-premise
of I-premise
thousands I-premise
of I-premise
tourists I-premise
. O

Our B-premise
governments I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
happy I-premise
with I-premise
those I-premise
efficient I-premise
consequences I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
a I-premise
majority I-premise
of I-premise
cities I-premise
also I-premise
can I-premise
imitate I-premise
this I-premise
economical I-premise
cycle I-premise
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the B-claim
city I-claim
which I-claim
I I-claim
enjoy I-claim
the I-claim
most I-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
combination I-claim
of I-claim
history I-claim
and I-claim
modernity I-claim
. O

However O
, O
the B-premise
preservation I-premise
of I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
one I-premise
- I-premise
way I-premise
street I-premise
. O

There B-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
chance I-premise
to I-premise
renovate I-premise
to I-premise
save I-premise
a I-premise
history I-premise
site I-premise
once I-premise
it I-premise
's I-premise
gone I-premise
. O

This B-premise
reality I-premise
brings I-premise
us I-premise
to I-premise
light I-premise
the I-premise
importance I-premise
of I-premise
locating I-premise
and I-premise
saving I-premise
old I-premise
buildings I-premise
of I-premise
historic I-premise
significance I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
government B-claim
should I-claim
spend I-claim
money I-claim
on I-claim
preservation I-claim
of I-claim
old I-claim
buildings I-claim
. O

There O
have O
been O
significant O
developments O
in O
the O
field O
of O
IT O
! O

Decade O
after O
decade O
, O
every O
day O
, O
scientists O
discover O
magnificent O
devices O
in O
the O
field O
of O
IT O
, O
such O
as O
interactive O
boards O
, O
multicore O
computers O
and O
laptops O
, O
tablets O
, O
which O
have O
an O
incredible O
resolution O
and O
also O
mobile O

which O
have O
the O
power O
of O
a O
computer O

World O
Wide O
Web O
and O
communication O
via O
email O
are O
some O
of O
the O
positive O
sides O
of O
information O
technology O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
some O
negative O
aspects O
. O

Firstly O
, O
connecting B-claim
people I-claim
by I-claim
email I-claim
is I-claim
easy I-claim
and I-claim
fast I-claim
. O

In O
addition O
, O
World B-claim
Wide I-claim
Web I-claim
offers I-claim
humanity I-claim
to I-claim
access I-claim
to I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
they I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
know I-claim
for I-claim
less I-claim
than I-claim
10 I-claim
seconds I-claim
. O

These O
are O
two O
of O
the O
benefits O
, O
why O
IT O
is O
useful O
. O

Besides O
, O
nowadays B-claim
technology I-claim
is I-claim
entering I-claim
into I-claim
our I-claim
society I-claim
really I-claim
quick I-claim
and O
scientists B-premise
develop I-premise
robots I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
help I-premise
people I-premise
cope I-premise
with I-premise
their I-premise
problems I-premise
or I-premise
just I-premise
invent I-premise
coffee I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
engines I-premise
with I-premise
integrated I-premise
computers I-premise
and I-premise
etc I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
before B-premise
centeries I-premise
, I-premise
there I-premise
were I-premise
not I-premise
washing I-premise
machines I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
clean I-premise
your I-premise
clothes I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
a I-premise
person I-premise
do I-premise
another I-premise
job I-premise
. O

Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
some O
drawbacks O
about O
this O
issue O
. O

Scientists B-premise
believe I-premise
that I-premise
one I-premise
day I-premise
people I-premise
will I-premise
face I-premise
their I-premise
developments I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
instance I-premise
robots I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
succeed I-premise
to I-premise
control I-premise
them I-premise
. O

All B-claim
this I-claim
inventions I-claim
will I-claim
try I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
control I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
Earth I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
IT B-claim
discoveries I-claim
are I-claim
likely I-claim
to I-claim
have I-claim
more I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
than I-claim
benefits I-claim
and I-claim
people I-claim
should I-claim
know I-claim
how I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
their I-claim
developments I-claim
properly I-claim
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
that O
the O
traditional O
skills O
will O
die O
out O
? O

With O
the O
development O
of O
technology O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
still O
necessary O
to O
protect O
the O
traditional O
skills O
and O
lifestyles O
leads O
to O
a O
drastic O
controversy O
which O
is O
becoming O
a O
public O
concern O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
significant O
impact O
taken O
by O
technology O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
the B-claim
importance I-claim
of I-claim
traditions I-claim
should I-claim
be I-claim
valued I-claim
and I-claim
paid I-claim
attention I-claim
to I-claim
. O

Traditional B-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
lifestyles I-claim
play I-claim
important I-claim
role I-claim
in I-claim
modern I-claim
society I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
terms I-claim
of I-claim
healthcare I-claim
, I-claim
environmental I-claim
protection I-claim
and I-claim
cultural I-claim
inherit I-claim
. O

Although O
technology B-premise
takes I-premise
convenience I-premise
to I-premise
humankind I-premise
, O
it B-premise
also I-premise
contributes I-premise
to I-premise
unhealthy I-premise
behaviors I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
, I-premise
like I-premise
sedentary I-premise
lifestyle I-premise
. O

Instead O
, O
traditional B-premise
ways I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
complimentary I-premise
for I-premise
modern I-premise
life I-premise
and I-premise
highlight I-premise
the I-premise
importance I-premise
of I-premise
work I-premise
life I-premise
balance I-premise
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
traditional B-premise
skills I-premise
rely I-premise
little I-premise
on I-premise
fossil I-premise
energy I-premise
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
more I-premise
environmentally I-premise
- I-premise
friendly I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
promoted I-premise
to I-premise
reduce I-premise
the I-premise
threat I-premise
of I-premise
climate I-premise
change I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
those B-premise
tradition I-premise
- I-premise
related I-premise
things I-premise
convey I-premise
traditional I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
values I-premise
. O

These B-premise
are I-premise
important I-premise
foundation I-premise
of I-premise
modern I-premise
civilization I-premise
. O

Protection B-premise
of I-premise
tradition I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
the I-premise
possibility I-premise
to I-premise
better I-premise
understand I-premise
ancient I-premise
culture I-premise
and I-premise
utilize I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
tackle I-premise
modern I-premise
problems I-premise
. O

Some O
people O
who O
hold O
different O
viewpoints O
may O
advocate O
that O
protecting B-claim
traditions I-claim
consume I-claim
too I-claim
much I-claim
financial I-claim
budget I-claim
compared I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
incoming I-claim
it I-claim
takes I-claim
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
this B-premise
kind I-premise
of I-premise
business I-premise
bring I-premise
limited I-premise
contribution I-premise
to I-premise
government I-premise
finance I-premise
, O
it O
should O
be O
emphasized O
that O
the B-premise
expense I-premise
is I-premise
trivial I-premise
compared I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
potential I-premise
value I-premise
of I-premise
traditions I-premise
. O

Therefore O
the B-claim
government I-claim
authorities I-claim
and I-claim
education I-claim
institutes I-claim
should I-claim
work I-claim
closely I-claim
together I-claim
to I-claim
promote I-claim
the I-claim
traditional I-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
ways I-claim
of I-claim
life I-claim
, I-claim
so I-claim
as I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
people I-claim
to I-claim
realize I-claim
the I-claim
value I-claim
of I-claim
them I-claim
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
protection B-claim
of I-claim
tradition I-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
entire I-claim
society I-claim
currently I-claim
, I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
contributes I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
next I-claim
generation I-claim
. O

Paying O
taxes O
is O
enough O
contribution O
from O
citizens O
Paying O
taxes O
is O
the O
obligation O
of O
citizens O
in O
almost O
every O
country O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
they O
have O
made O
enough O
contribution O
to O
the O
country O
by O
doing O
that O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
all B-claim
people I-claim
who I-claim
are I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
work I-claim
should I-claim
pay I-claim
tax I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
government I-claim
, O
as O
it B-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
most I-premise
important I-premise
source I-premise
of I-premise
government I-premise
's I-premise
revenue I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
mainly I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
serve I-premise
all I-premise
citizens I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
large I-premise
proportion I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
tax I-premise
is I-premise
spent I-premise
on I-premise
national I-premise
defence I-premise
and I-premise
in I-premise
maintaining I-premise
social I-premise
stability I-premise
, O
so O
that O
every B-premise
one I-premise
can I-premise
work I-premise
and I-premise
live I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
peaceful I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

The B-premise
tax I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
pay I-premise
the I-premise
salaries I-premise
of I-premise
workers I-premise
working I-premise
in I-premise
public I-premise
service I-premise
sectors I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
teachers I-premise
and I-premise
police I-premise
officers I-premise
. O

Although O
these B-premise
workers I-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
produce I-premise
profit I-premise
directly I-premise
, O
what B-premise
they I-premise
do I-premise
is I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
being I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
whole I-premise
society I-premise
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
citizens B-claim
have I-claim
other I-claim
important I-claim
responsibilities I-claim
to I-claim
fulfil I-claim
apart I-claim
from I-claim
paying I-claim
tax I-claim
. O

As O
we O
know O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
impoverished I-premise
or I-premise
disabled I-premise
people I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
needing I-premise
help I-premise
and I-premise
support I-premise
from I-premise
others I-premise
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the B-premise
government I-premise
can I-premise
provide I-premise
some I-premise
fund I-premise
to I-premise
ease I-premise
their I-premise
difficulties I-premise
, O
but O
such B-premise
financial I-premise
help I-premise
is I-premise
usually I-premise
far I-premise
from I-premise
enough I-premise
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
aids B-premise
from I-premise
more I-premise
capable I-premise
or I-premise
wealthier I-premise
citizens I-premise
are I-premise
particularly I-premise
crucial I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
are I-premise
a I-premise
great I-premise
complement I-premise
to I-premise
government I-premise
support I-premise
. O

Another B-premise
responsibility I-premise
all I-premise
citizens I-premise
should I-premise
take I-premise
is I-premise
to I-premise
maintain I-premise
social I-premise
stability I-premise
together I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
police I-premise
force I-premise
. O

There B-premise
are I-premise
criminals I-premise
in I-premise
every I-premise
society I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
policemen I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
can I-premise
hire I-premise
is I-premise
limited I-premise
. O

So O
it B-premise
is I-premise
quite I-premise
necessary I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
residents I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
actions I-premise
and I-premise
ensure I-premise
the I-premise
safety I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
communities I-premise
, I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
things I-premise
like I-premise
reporting I-premise
suspicious I-premise
activities I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
police I-premise
department I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
a O
significant O
obligation O
of O
citizens O
to O
pay O
tax O
to O
the O
government O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
they B-claim
have I-claim
other I-claim
critical I-claim
obligations I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
, I-claim
in I-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
make I-claim
our I-claim
society I-claim
function I-claim
in I-claim
an I-claim
ordered I-claim
way I-claim
. O

Using O
a O
computer O
every O
day O
can O
have O
more O
negative O
than O
positive O
effects O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
computer O
is O
an O
essential O
part O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

Around O
the O
globe O
, O
the O
effect O
is O
evident O
on O
children O
also O
. O

It B-claim
is I-claim
disagreed I-claim
that I-claim
computer I-claim
can I-claim
affect I-claim
children I-claim
in I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
way I-claim
if I-claim
they I-claim
use I-claim
a I-claim
computer I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
daily I-claim
basis I-claim
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
analyzing O
how O
computer B-claim
assists I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
use I-claim
vast I-claim
resources I-claim
available I-claim
over I-claim
internet I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
effectively I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
develop I-claim
some I-claim
basic I-claim
skills I-claim
which I-claim
help I-claim
them I-claim
in I-claim
future I-claim
careers I-claim
. O

The B-premise
best I-premise
thing I-premise
about I-premise
internet I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
availability I-premise
of I-premise
information I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
form I-premise
of I-premise
text I-premise
, I-premise
image I-premise
or I-premise
video I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
almost I-premise
everything I-premise
and O
through B-premise
computer I-premise
children I-premise
can I-premise
access I-premise
internet I-premise
to I-premise
gather I-premise
knowledge I-premise
on I-premise
the I-premise
subjects I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
studying I-premise
or I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
interested I-premise
about I-premise
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
students B-premise
preparing I-premise
for I-premise
delivering I-premise
speech I-premise
on I-premise
a I-premise
certain I-premise
topic I-premise
can I-premise
browse I-premise
through I-premise
internet I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
each I-premise
and I-premise
every I-premise
minute I-premise
details I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
subject I-premise
matter I-premise
. O

It B-premise
's I-premise
hard I-premise
to I-premise
get I-premise
everything I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
same I-premise
place I-premise
unless I-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
not I-premise
familiar I-premise
with I-premise
computers I-premise
. O

That O
is O
how O
, O
computer B-claim
impacts I-claim
children I-claim
on I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
note I-claim
. O

Nowadays O
, O
computers B-premise
enable I-premise
people I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
presentations I-premise
, I-premise
draw I-premise
complex I-premise
graphs I-premise
and I-premise
pictures I-premise
, I-premise
document I-premise
thesis I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
simple I-premise
though I-premise
efficient I-premise
way I-premise
. O

When B-premise
children I-premise
are I-premise
allowed I-premise
to I-premise
play I-premise
around I-premise
with I-premise
computer I-premise
from I-premise
a I-premise
very I-premise
early I-premise
age I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
get I-premise
acquainted I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
previously I-premise
mentioned I-premise
skills I-premise
and I-premise
become I-premise
expert I-premise
before I-premise
facing I-premise
professional I-premise
world I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students B-premise
who I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
prepare I-premise
Microsoft I-premise
PowerPoint I-premise
presentation I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
school I-premise
projects I-premise
, I-premise
get I-premise
an I-premise
edge I-premise
over I-premise
others I-premise
at I-premise
an I-premise
early I-premise
stage I-premise
of I-premise
their I-premise
career I-premise
. O

From O
this O
, O
it B-claim
's I-claim
clear I-claim
that I-claim
computer I-claim
has I-claim
a I-claim
positive I-claim
effect I-claim
on I-claim
the I-claim
children I-claim
. O

Following O
the O
demonstration O
of O
a O
computer O
's O
contribution O
in O
children O
's O
study O
and O
building O
skills O
which O
are O
to O
be O
used O
in O
their O
career O
afterwards O
, O
it O
is O
agreed O
that O
computer B-claim
is I-claim
a I-claim
boon I-claim
to I-claim
children I-claim
. O

However O
, O
parents O
should O
advise O
and O
guide O
their O
children O
properly O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
misled O
. O

Foreign O
language O
instruction O
should O
begin O
in O
kindergarten O
Educational O
institutions O
have O
different O
systems O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
introducing O
foreign O
languages O
to O
children O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
foreign O
language O
instruction O
should O
start O
in O
pre O
- O
school O
. O

However O
, O
those O
who O
disagree O
contend O
that O
this O
should O
be O
taught O
in O
later O
years O
. O

This O
issue O
has O
garnered O
some O
attention O
in O
the O
academe O
as O
it O
has O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
children O
's O
learning O
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
it B-claim
is I-claim
important I-claim
for I-claim
children I-claim
to I-claim
be I-claim
taught I-claim
with I-claim
a I-claim
secondary I-claim
language I-claim
as I-claim
early I-claim
as I-claim
kindergarten I-claim
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
children B-claim
might I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
really I-claim
comfortable I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
use I-claim
of I-claim
a I-claim
language I-claim
other I-claim
than I-claim
their I-claim
native I-claim
tongue I-claim
when I-claim
they I-claim
are I-claim
in I-claim
their I-claim
kindergarten I-claim
years I-claim
. O

Learning B-premise
at I-premise
school I-premise
must I-premise
be I-premise
convenient I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
if I-premise
they I-premise
speak I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
way I-premise
that I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
used I-premise
to I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
teachers B-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
most I-premise
likely I-premise
leads I-premise
to I-premise
confusion I-premise
for I-premise
children I-premise
who I-premise
are I-premise
yet I-premise
to I-premise
start I-premise
learning I-premise
. O

Another O
important O
thing O
to O
consider O
is O
that O
the B-premise
teacher I-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
well I-premise
- I-premise
trained I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
use I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
specific I-premise
language I-premise
, I-premise
so I-premise
quality I-premise
education I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
delivered I-premise
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
kids B-premise
are I-premise
amazing I-premise
learners I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
time I-premise
to I-premise
hone I-premise
them I-premise
is I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
younger I-premise
years I-premise
. O

The B-premise
introduction I-premise
of I-premise
foreign I-premise
language I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
new I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
; O
however O
, O
their B-premise
curiosity I-premise
will I-premise
drive I-premise
them I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
and I-premise
comprehend I-premise
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
grasping B-premise
a I-premise
new I-premise
language I-premise
will I-premise
be I-premise
natural I-premise
to I-premise
them I-premise
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-premise
positive I-premise
impact I-premise
of I-premise
this I-premise
strategy I-premise
is I-premise
beneficial I-premise
to I-premise
both I-premise
learners I-premise
and I-premise
teachers I-premise
. O

Teachers B-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
find I-premise
it I-premise
difficult I-premise
to I-premise
make I-premise
students I-premise
learn I-premise
such I-premise
new I-premise
concept I-premise
in I-premise
their I-premise
teenage I-premise
years I-premise
. O

It O
is O
certainly O
clear O
that O
the B-claim
advantages I-claim
of I-claim
early I-claim
introduction I-claim
of I-claim
foreign I-claim
language I-claim
outweigh I-claim
its I-claim
disadvantages I-claim
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
use O
of O
foreign O
language O
instruction O
as O
early O
as O
kindergarten O
is O
supported O
by O
some O
people O
; O
however O
, O
there O
are O
those O
who O
disagree O
. O

I O
am O
totally O
convinced O
that O
if B-claim
this I-claim
endeavour I-claim
is I-claim
properly I-claim
implemented I-claim
by I-claim
schools I-claim
, I-claim
this I-claim
will I-claim
most I-claim
likely I-claim
lead I-claim
to I-claim
improvement I-claim
of I-claim
learning I-claim
ability I-claim
among I-claim
children I-claim
. O

International O
tourism O
leads O
to O
both O
- O
tension O
and O
understanding O

I O
agree O
with O
both O
opinions O
that O
international B-claim
tourism I-claim
not I-claim
only I-claim
causes I-claim
tension I-claim
but I-claim
also I-claim
leads I-claim
to I-claim
understanding I-claim
between I-claim
people I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
culture I-claim
, O
because O
most B-claim
people I-claim
will I-claim
be I-claim
trying I-claim
to I-claim
understand I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
after I-claim
they I-claim
have I-claim
conflict I-claim
or I-claim
debates I-claim
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
some B-claim
behaviors I-claim
of I-claim
the I-claim
tourists I-claim
are I-claim
not I-claim
welcome I-claim
in I-claim
the I-claim
local I-claim
area I-claim
. O

Firstly O
, O
some B-premise
people I-premise
leave I-premise
the I-premise
rubbish I-premise
after I-premise
visiting I-premise
the I-premise
attractions I-premise
. O

Therefore O
, O
those B-premise
local I-premise
residents I-premise
have I-premise
to I-premise
clean I-premise
the I-premise
place I-premise
frequently I-premise
so O
that O
the B-premise
new I-premise
batch I-premise
of I-premise
tourists I-premise
will I-premise
have I-premise
a I-premise
tidy I-premise
and I-premise
neat I-premise
environment I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
tourists B-premise
may I-premise
offend I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
people I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
their I-premise
different I-premise
culture I-premise
background I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
Indians B-premise
do I-premise
n't I-premise
eat I-premise
beef I-premise
since O
they B-premise
worship I-premise
cows I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
if B-premise
tourists I-premise
want I-premise
to I-premise
respect I-premise
the I-premise
tradition I-premise
, I-premise
they I-premise
will I-premise
not I-premise
order I-premise
any I-premise
beef I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
restaurant I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
in B-claim
order I-claim
to I-claim
avoid I-claim
the I-claim
conflicts I-claim
between I-claim
foreigners I-claim
and I-claim
locals I-claim
, I-claim
people I-claim
are I-claim
trying I-claim
to I-claim
understand I-claim
different I-claim
culture I-claim
and I-claim
find I-claim
solutions I-claim
. O

For O
instance O
, O
tourists B-premise
are I-premise
given I-premise
the I-premise
brochures I-premise
about I-premise
the I-premise
local I-premise
traditions I-premise
and I-premise
customs I-premise
before I-premise
they I-premise
visit I-premise
the I-premise
place I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the B-premise
tour I-premise
guide I-premise
are I-premise
willing I-premise
to I-premise
help I-premise
tourists I-premise
to I-premise
understand I-premise
the I-premise
culture I-premise
from I-premise
other I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-premise
possibility I-premise
of I-premise
the I-premise
conflicts I-premise
is I-premise
reduced I-premise
because I-premise
the I-premise
understanding I-premise
between I-premise
both I-premise
parties I-premise
. O

Obviously O
, O
people B-claim
are I-claim
looking I-claim
for I-claim
the I-claim
solution I-claim
such I-claim
as I-claim
understanding I-claim
each I-claim
other I-claim
while I-claim
they I-claim
encounter I-claim
the I-claim
conflicts I-claim
caused I-claim
by I-claim
international I-claim
tourism I-claim
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
international B-claim
tourism I-claim
leads I-claim
to I-claim
both I-claim
tension I-claim
and I-claim
understanding I-claim
between I-claim
people I-claim
from I-claim
different I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

Traditional O
skills O
and O
ways O
are O
always O
valuable O
and O
will O
last O
forever O
These O
days O
, O
most O
of O
countries O
on O
the O
world O
invest O
for O
technology O
. O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
technology O
promotes O
economy O
. O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
conventional O
things O
will O
not O
exist O
and O
should O
be O
eliminated O
. O

I O
totally O
disagree O
this O
opinion O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
traditional B-claim
skills I-claim
and I-claim
ways I-claim
belong I-claim
to I-claim
value I-claim
of I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

They B-premise
make I-premise
differences I-premise
between I-premise
countries I-premise
. O

Every B-premise
country I-premise

Consequently O

people B-premise
feel I-premise
pround I-premise

so O
they B-premise
keep I-premise

For O
example O

ways B-premise

build I-premise
a I-premise

every I-premise

different I-premise

they I-premise
distinguish I-premise

In O
addition O
, O
in B-claim
some I-claim
cases I-claim
that I-claim
traditional I-claim
way I-claim
can I-claim
not I-claim
replace I-claim
by I-claim
a I-claim
new I-claim
technology I-claim
. O

Lot B-premise
of I-premise
people I-premise
like I-premise

use I-premise
traditional I-premise
things I-premise
because I-premise
if I-premise
their I-premise
quality I-premise
and I-premise
durability I-premise
. O

In O
paticular O
, O
vases B-premise
are I-premise
made I-premise

be I-premise
used I-premise
more I-premise

Futhermore O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
plenty I-premise
of I-premise
works I-premise
that I-premise
using I-premise
traditional I-premise

is I-premise
unique I-premise
method I-premise

For O

making B-premise

use I-premise

Not B-premise
only I-premise
because I-premise
there I-premise
is I-premise
no I-premise
machine I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
work I-premise
, I-premise
but I-premise
also I-premise
it I-premise
looks I-premise
more I-premise
beautiful I-premise
when I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
made I-premise

so I-premise
resulting I-premise
in I-premise
greater I-premise
value I-premise

. O

The O
last O
thing O
is O
about O
education O

Traditional B-claim
skills I-claim

Methods B-premise
which I-premise
their I-premise

they B-premise

In O
conclusion O

technology B-claim

traditional B-claim

that O
it O

in O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
it B-claim
is I-claim
no I-claim
evidence I-claim
about I-claim
the I-claim
reduction I-claim
of I-claim
crime I-claim
rates I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
death I-claim
penalty I-claim
because O
of O
many O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
capital B-premise
punishment I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
form I-premise
of I-premise
revenge I-premise
which I-premise
creates I-premise
violent I-premise
culture I-premise
. O

Crimes B-premise
kill I-premise
someone I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
illegal I-premise
; I-premise
nevertheless I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
government I-premise
use I-premise
law I-premise
to I-premise
punish I-premise
them I-premise
, I-premise
which I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
same I-premise
way I-premise
they I-premise
sinned I-premise
but I-premise
in I-premise
a I-premise
legal I-premise
one I-premise
. O

As O
a O
fact O
that O
the B-premise
criminal I-premise
is I-premise
repeated I-premise
second I-premise
time I-premise
; O
also O
, O
it B-premise
is I-premise
regarded I-premise
as I-premise
the I-premise
" I-premise
legalized I-premise
revenge I-premise
" I-premise
to I-premise
victims I-premise
' I-premise
family I-premise
. O

Hence O
, O
death B-claim
penalty I-claim
neither I-claim
controls I-claim
the I-claim
violent I-claim
in I-claim
society I-claim
nor I-claim
creates I-claim
a I-claim
violent I-claim
culture I-claim
. O

Secondly O
, O
nobody B-claim
has I-claim
the I-claim
right I-claim
to I-claim
take I-claim
another I-claim
human I-claim
life I-claim
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the B-premise
rights I-premise
of I-premise
life I-premise
are I-premise
the I-premise
basic I-premise
and I-premise
vital I-premise
rights I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
human I-premise
being I-premise
. O

No B-premise
one I-premise
has I-premise
the I-premise
right I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
the I-premise
life I-premise
of I-premise
a I-premise
human I-premise
; I-premise
even I-premise
if I-premise
he I-premise
committed I-premise
murder I-premise
. O

If B-premise
you I-premise
kill I-premise
a I-premise
criminal I-premise
, I-premise
you I-premise
become I-premise
a I-premise
criminal I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
if B-premise
we I-premise
think I-premise
that I-premise
killing I-premise
is I-premise
the I-premise
best I-premise
way I-premise
to I-premise
solve I-premise
the I-premise
problem I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
neither I-premise
unethical I-premise
nor I-premise
immoral I-premise
. O

In O
short O
, O
crimes B-premise
seem I-premise
to I-premise
increase I-premise
due I-premise
to I-premise
the I-premise
capital I-premise
punishment I-premise
. O

Finally O
, O
with B-claim
some I-claim
of I-claim
serious I-claim
criminals I-claim
, I-claim
capital I-claim
punishment I-claim
is I-claim
an I-claim
easy I-claim
way I-claim
out I-claim
. O

Criminals B-premise
should I-premise
be I-premise
punished I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
misdeeds I-premise
. O

If B-premise
they I-premise
kill I-premise
someone I-premise
and I-premise
end I-premise
their I-premise
life I-premise
by I-premise
dead I-premise
without I-premise
paying I-premise
for I-premise
their I-premise
sins I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
so I-premise
easy I-premise
for I-premise
them I-premise
. O

They B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
undergo I-premise
any I-premise
pain I-premise
or I-premise
misery I-premise
. O

Why O
do O
not O
we O
have O
other O
wisely O
punishments O
? O

As O
we O
can O
see O
some B-premise
industries I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
mining I-premise
, I-premise
oil I-premise
and I-premise
gas I-premise
extraction I-premise
, I-premise
reclamation I-premise
, I-premise
etc I-premise
, I-premise
needs I-premise
many I-premise
labors I-premise
. O

Why B-premise
do I-premise
not I-premise
punish I-premise
them I-premise
by I-premise
doing I-premise
something I-premise
meaningful I-premise
for I-premise
the I-premise
country- I-premise

it I-premise
is I-premise
better I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
rehabilitation B-premise
and I-premise
education I-premise
is I-premise
also I-premise
a I-premise
better I-premise
way I-premise
in I-premise
order I-premise
to I-premise
prevent I-premise
or I-premise
minimize I-premise
offensive I-premise
acts I-premise
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
capital B-premise
punishment I-premise
is I-premise
a I-premise
form I-premise
of I-premise
legalized I-premise
revenge I-premise
, I-premise
it I-premise
is I-premise
an I-premise
easy I-premise
way I-premise
for I-premise
serious I-premise
crimes I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
nobody I-premise
has I-premise
rights I-premise
to I-premise
take I-premise
others I-premise
life I-premise
; O
thus O
, O
it B-claim
neither I-claim
demines I-claim
crimes I-claim
of I-claim
violence I-claim
nor I-claim
be I-claim
essential I-claim
to I-claim
control I-claim
violence I-claim
in I-claim
society I-claim
. O

The B-claim
world I-claim
should I-claim
consider I-claim
clearly I-claim
about I-claim
polishing I-claim
the I-claim
law I-claim

the I-claim

Technology O

Nowadays O

technology O
plays O
an O
indispensable O
role O
in O
almost O
all O
spheres O

In O
education O

it O
is O
believed O
that O

help O
the O

From O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
the B-claim
richness I-claim
as I-claim
well I-claim
as I-claim
convenience I-claim
of I-claim
technology I-claim
are I-claim
two I-claim
main I-claim
factors I-claim
that I-claim
contribute I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
students I-claim
' I-claim
progress I-claim
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
since O
technology B-claim
was I-claim
introduced I-claim
, I-claim
student I-claim
have I-claim
been I-claim
exposed I-claim
to I-claim
a I-claim
wide I-claim
range I-claim
of I-claim
information I-claim
, I-claim
which I-claim
neccessarily I-claim
broaden I-claim
their I-claim
minds I-claim
. O

The B-premise
internet I-premise
, I-premise
for I-premise
example I-premise
, I-premise
provide I-premise
knowledge I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
form I-premise
of I-premise
news I-premise
, I-premise
radio I-premise
talks I-premise
, I-premise
tapes I-premise
or I-premise
reseachs I-premise
on I-premise
any I-premise
particular I-premise
fields I-premise
. O

There B-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
students I-premise
can I-premise
not I-premise
only I-premise
ascertain I-premise
concerned I-premise
subjects I-premise
but I-premise
they I-premise
can I-premise
also I-premise
get I-premise
access I-premise
to I-premise
relevant I-premise
issues I-premise
and I-premise
discuss I-premise
with I-premise
people I-premise
worldwide I-premise
. O

Another B-claim
point I-claim
that I-claim
students I-claim
may I-claim
benefit I-claim
from I-claim
technology I-claim
is I-claim
the I-claim
shortened I-claim
time I-claim
for I-claim
learning I-claim
. O

The B-premise
modern I-premise
world I-premise
provides I-premise
learners I-premise
with I-premise
the I-premise
mp3 I-premise
, I-premise
the I-premise
mobile I-premise
phone I-premise
or I-premise
the I-premise
laptop I-premise
that I-premise

especially I-premise

, I-premise
listen I-premise
to I-premise
recordings I-premise
everywhre I-premise
or I-premise
read I-premise
documents I-premise
anytime I-premise

Therefore O
, O
students B-premise
will I-premise
develop I-premise
their I-premise
skills I-premise
at I-premise
a I-premise
greater I-premise
pace I-premise
. O

Moreover O
, O
the B-premise

more I-premise
briskly I-premise

thoroughly I-premise
. O

On O

I B-claim

the I-premise

Personally O

These B-premise

Consequently O

a B-claim
great I-claim

to I-premise
be I-premise
tracked I-premise
down I-premise
by I-premise
the I-premise
police I-premise
. O

Thus O
, O
without B-claim
the I-claim
prevention I-claim
on I-claim
criminal I-claim
details I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
unlawful I-claim
behavior I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
more I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
severe I-claim
and I-claim
the I-claim
social I-claim
harmony I-claim
would I-claim
be I-claim
broken I-claim
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
particular B-claim
coverage I-claim
of I-claim
heinous I-claim
crimes I-claim
may I-claim
further I-claim
traumatize I-claim
the I-claim
victims I-claim
of I-claim
crimes I-claim
because O
they B-premise
have I-premise
already I-premise
suffered I-premise
greatly I-premise
for I-premise
what I-premise
they I-premise
have I-premise
experienced I-premise
. O

Without B-premise
their I-premise
consent I-premise
, I-premise
this I-premise
could I-premise
only I-premise
add I-premise
to I-premise
theses I-premise
innocent I-premise
people I-premise
's I-premise
mental I-premise
suffering I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
may I-premise
do I-premise
some I-premise
extreme I-premise
actions I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
hold O
my O
point O
that O
any B-claim
descriptions I-claim
of I-claim
crimes I-claim
should I-claim
not I-claim
go I-claim
unchecked I-claim
as I-claim
any I-claim
longer I-claim
, O
as B-claim
they I-claim
may I-claim
be I-claim
false I-claim
, I-claim
may I-claim
further I-claim
drive I-claim
up I-claim
the I-claim
already I-claim
- I-claim
high I-claim
crime I-claim
rate I-claim
and I-claim
may I-claim
bring I-claim
even I-claim
more I-claim
suffering I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
victims I-claim
of I-claim
crimes I-claim
. O

We O
can O
not O
forcedly O
put O
the O
same O
numbers O
of O
males O
and O
females O
into O
every O
subject O

There O
is O
a O
view O
that O
universities O
and O
colleges O
should O
equally O
enroll O
male O
and O
female O
students O
in O
numbers O
in O
each O
faculty O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
the O
viewpoint O
, O
because O
many B-claim
different I-claim
characters I-claim
exist I-claim
between I-claim
male I-claim
and I-claim
female I-claim
students I-claim
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
boys B-claim
and I-claim
girls I-claim
have I-claim
the I-claim
diversity I-claim
in I-claim
psychological I-claim
modes I-claim
and I-claim
individuality I-claim
. O

Most B-premise
of I-premise
male I-premise
students I-premise
tend I-premise
to I-premise
use I-premise
their I-premise
left I-premise
brain I-premise
to I-premise
think I-premise
and I-premise
act I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
rational I-premise
and I-premise
logical I-premise
than I-premise
girls I-premise
in I-premise
many I-premise
cases I-premise
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
male I-premise
scientists I-premise
and I-premise
engineers I-premise
in I-premise
comparison I-premise
with I-premise
females I-premise
around I-premise
the I-premise
world I-premise
. O

Many B-premise
boys I-premise
are I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
science I-premise
and I-premise
technology I-premise
, I-premise
while I-premise
a I-premise
number I-premise
of I-premise
girls I-premise
like I-premise
to I-premise
learn I-premise
literature I-premise
, I-premise
education I-premise
and I-premise
arts I-premise
. O

Besides O
, O
girls B-premise
are I-premise
more I-premise
likely I-premise
to I-premise
prefer I-premise
some I-premise
jobs I-premise
related I-premise
to I-premise
emotion I-premise
and I-premise
communication I-premise
, I-premise
such I-premise
as I-premise
teacher I-premise
, I-premise
singer I-premise
and I-premise
interpreter I-premise
. O

This O
means O
that O
girls B-premise
differ I-premise
from I-premise
boys I-premise
in I-premise
mind I-premise
and I-premise
behaviour I-premise
to I-premise
a I-premise
large I-premise
extent I-premise
, I-premise
and I-premise
they I-premise
both I-premise
have I-premise
better I-premise
ability I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
specific I-premise
aspect I-premise
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it B-claim
can I-claim
have I-claim
a I-claim
negative I-claim
affect I-claim
on I-claim
these I-claim
students I-claim
to I-claim
require I-claim
them I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
a I-claim
subject I-claim
in I-claim
equal I-claim
proportion I-claim
of I-claim
gender I-claim
, O
and O
that B-premise
does I-premise
not I-premise
conform I-premise
to I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
personality I-premise
traits I-premise
and I-premise
mental I-premise
development I-premise
. O

For O
example O
, O
a B-premise
girl I-premise
, I-premise
who I-premise
is I-premise
interested I-premise
in I-premise
literature I-premise
, I-premise
is I-premise
arranged I-premise
into I-premise
an I-premise
engineering I-premise
department I-premise
, O
but O
she B-premise
is I-premise
unlikely I-premise
to I-premise
focus I-premise
on I-premise
her I-premise
subject I-premise
, O
and O
this B-premise
also I-premise
can I-premise
block I-premise
the I-premise
girl I-premise
's I-premise
future I-premise
development I-premise
and I-premise
career I-premise
prospect I-premise
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
universities B-claim
should I-claim
encourage I-claim
more I-claim
girls I-claim
to I-claim
choose I-claim
science I-claim
subjects I-claim
and I-claim
more I-claim
boys I-claim
to I-claim
study I-claim
the I-claim
humanities I-claim
, O
and O
this B-premise
could I-premise
avoid I-premise
imbalance I-premise
of I-premise
gender I-premise
in I-premise
some I-premise
subjects I-premise
. O

It B-premise
would I-premise
affect I-premise
students I-premise
' I-premise
mental I-premise
health I-premise
to I-premise
study I-premise
in I-premise
the I-premise
environment I-premise
of I-premise
single I-premise
gender I-premise
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it B-claim
is I-claim
necessary I-claim
for I-claim
universities I-claim
to I-claim
respect I-claim
the I-claim
individual I-claim
choice I-claim
of I-claim
subject I-claim
due I-claim
to I-claim
the I-claim
diversity I-claim
of I-claim
boys I-claim
and I-claim
girls I-claim
, I-claim
and I-claim
we I-claim
ca I-claim
not I-claim
forcedly I-claim
put I-claim
the I-claim
same I-claim
numbers I-claim
of I-claim
males I-claim
and I-claim
females I-claim
into I-claim
every I-claim
subject I-claim
