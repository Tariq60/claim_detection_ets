Should O
students O
be O
taught O
to O
compete O
or O
to O
cooperate O
? O

It O
is O
always O
said O
that O
competition O
can O
effectively O
promote O
the O
development O
of O
economy O
. O

In O
order O
to O
survive O
in O
the O
competition O
, O
companies O
continue O
to O
improve O
their O
products O
and O
service O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
the O
whole O
society O
prospers O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we O
discuss O
the O
issue O
of O
competition O
or O
cooperation O
, O
what O
we O
are O
concerned O
about O
is O
not O
the O
whole O
society O
, O
but O
the O
development O
of O
an O
individual O
's O
whole O
life O
. O

From O
this O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
attach Arg-I
more Arg-I
importance Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
during Arg-I
primary Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
through Arg-B
cooperation Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
interpersonal Arg-I
skills Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
significant Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
we Arg-I
acquired Arg-I
from Arg-I
team Arg-I
work Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
goal Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
but Arg-I
more Arg-I
importantly Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

During Arg-B
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
opinions Arg-I
of Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
comprehensively Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
compromise Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
team Arg-I
members Arg-I
when Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
occurred Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
skills Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
on Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the Arg-B
significance Arg-I
of Arg-I
competition Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
excellence Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
the Arg-I
victory Arg-I
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
always O
said O
that O
competition Arg-B
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
when Arg-B
we Arg-I
consider Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
question Arg-I
that Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
win Arg-I
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
always Arg-I
find Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
need Arg-I
the Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
. O

The O
greater O
our O
goal O
is O
, O
the O
more O
competition O
we O
need O
. O

Take Arg-B
Olympic Arg-I
games Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
competition Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
how Arg-I
an Arg-I
athlete Arg-I
could Arg-I
win Arg-I
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
without Arg-I
the Arg-I
training Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
coach Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
professional Arg-I
staffs Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
diet Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
charge Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
. O

The O
winner O
is O
the O
athlete O
but O
the O
success O
belongs O
to O
the O
whole O
team O
. O

Therefore O
without Arg-B
the Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
victory Arg-I
of Arg-I
competition Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
view O
of O
individual O
development O
or O
the O
relationship O
between O
competition O
and O
cooperation O
we O
can O
receive O
the O
same O
conclusion O
that O
a Arg-B
more Arg-I
cooperative Arg-I
attitudes Arg-I
towards Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
profitable Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

More O
people O
are O
migrating O
to O
other O
countries O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
50 O
years O
have O
seen O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
immigrants O
to O
other O
countries O
. O

People O
moved O
due O
to O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
, O
namely O
better O
educations O
or O
higher O
salary O
jobs O
. O

Some O
people O
thought O
that O
they O
should O
follow O
the O
local O
customs O
in O
order O
to O
integrate O
into O
their O
adopted O
countries O
’ O
cultures O
. O

However O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
sustain Arg-I
their Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identities Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
so Arg-I
help Arg-I
they Arg-I
keep Arg-I
their Arg-I
origin Arg-I
values Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
maintaining Arg-B
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identity Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
key Arg-I
important Arg-I
rule Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
emerge Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
multicultural Arg-I
environments Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
Australia Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
from Arg-I
varieties Arg-I
of Arg-I
nations Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
day Arg-I
called Arg-I
multicultural Arg-I
day Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
each Arg-I
country Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
their Arg-I
food Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
activities Arg-I
for Arg-I
displaying Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
venues Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
Australians Arg-I
come Arg-I
this Arg-I
day Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
shows Arg-I
, Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
and Arg-I
admire Arg-I
the Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
values Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
feedbacks Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
, Arg-I
help Arg-I
raise Arg-I
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
pride Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Thus O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
sustaining Arg-B
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
values Arg-I
of Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
is Arg-I
paramount Arg-I
essential Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
identity Arg-I
for O
they Arg-B
need Arg-I
a Arg-I
connection Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
their Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
origin Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
children Arg-B
immigrated Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
will Arg-I
face Arg-I
social Arg-I
troubles Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
parent Arg-I
should Arg-I
find Arg-I
friends Arg-I
coming Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
same Arg-I
country Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
manner Arg-I
as Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
being Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Fail Arg-B
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
this Arg-I
familiarity Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
felt Arg-I
isolated Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
extreme Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
social Arg-I
disorder Arg-I
like Arg-I
autism Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
keeping Arg-B
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
countries Arg-I
is Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
although O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
opposing Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
of Arg-I
neglecting Arg-I
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
values Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
sustaining Arg-B
the Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
immigrated Arg-I
people Arg-I
keep Arg-I
their Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identity Arg-I
and Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
confident Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
many Arg-I
culture Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

International O
tourism O
is O
now O
more O
common O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
decade O
has O
seen O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
tourists O
traveling O
to O
visit O
natural O
wonder O
sights O
, O
ancient O
heritages O
and O
different O
cultures O
around O
the O
world O
. O

While O
some O
people O
might O
think O
that O
this O
international O
tourism O
has O
negative O
effects O
on O
the O
destination O
countries O
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
contributed Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
destinations Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
international Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
promotes Arg-I
many Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
country Arg-I
’s Arg-I
economy Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
serve Arg-I
various Arg-I
demands Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
Cambodia Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
coming Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
the Arg-I
Angkowat Arg-I
ancient Arg-I
temple Arg-I
need Arg-I
services Arg-I
like Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
, Arg-I
hotels Arg-I
, Arg-I
souvenir Arg-I
shops Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
stores Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
demands Arg-I
trigger Arg-I
related Arg-I
business Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
surrounding Arg-I
settings Arg-I
which Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
create Arg-I
many Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
for Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
improve Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
and Arg-I
living Arg-I
standard Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
tourism Arg-B
has Arg-I
clearly Arg-I
improved Arg-I
lives Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
through Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
values Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
and Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environments Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
protected Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
Vietnam Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
costumes Arg-I
and Arg-I
natural Arg-I
scenes Arg-I
, Arg-I
namely Arg-I
‘ Arg-I
Trong Arg-I
Dong Arg-I
’ Arg-I
drum Arg-I
performance Arg-I
and Arg-I
‘ Arg-I
Ha Arg-I
Long Arg-I
’ Arg-I
bay Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
being Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
and Arg-I
funded Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
ministry Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
this Arg-I
support Arg-I
and Arg-I
profit Arg-I
from Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
would Arg-I
disappear Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
its Arg-I
low Arg-I
income Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
tourism Arg-B
has Arg-I
survived Arg-I
many Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
tangible Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
values Arg-I
and Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
scenes Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
international Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
has Arg-I
both Arg-I
triggered Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
and Arg-I
maintained Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
and Arg-I
environment Arg-I
values Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
authorities O
should O
adequately O
support O
these O
sustainable O
developments O
. O

Will O
newspapers O
become O
a O
thing O
of O
the O
past O
? O

The O
internet O
has O
been O
more O
and O
more O
popular O
for O
recent O
years O
, O
providing O
people O
with O
a O
huge O
source O
of O
information O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
print O
media O
such O
as O
newspapers O
have O
experienced O
a O
dramatic O
decline O
in O
the O
number O
of O
readers O
. O

Some O
people O
, O
however O
, O
still O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
exist O
for O
long O
time O
; O
others O
disagree O
, O
arguing O
that O
newspapers Arg-B
have Arg-I
lost Arg-I
their Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
to Arg-I
sustain Arg-I
their Arg-I
prolonged Arg-I
existence Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
view O
for O
following O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
to Arg-B
obtain Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
using Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
is Arg-I
quicker Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
than Arg-I
reading Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
. O

Contrary Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
wait Arg-I
long Arg-I
hours Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
daily Arg-I
newspaper Arg-I
, Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
latest Arg-I
news Arg-I
updated Arg-I
every Arg-I
second Arg-I
through Arg-I
their Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
or Arg-I
computers Arg-I
connected Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
everywhere Arg-I
and Arg-I
at Arg-I
anytime Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
devices Arg-I
and Arg-I
machines Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
common Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
it Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
in Arg-I
only Arg-I
some Arg-I
pages Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
the Arg-B
print Arg-I
media Arg-I
has Arg-I
failed Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
its Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
provision Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

Another O
point O
is O
that O
, O
from Arg-B
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
, Arg-I
buying Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
appears Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
every Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
clear O
to O
recognize O
that O
the Arg-B
internet Arg-I
service Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
provided Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
low Arg-I
cost Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
free Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

The O
question O
arises O
as O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
person O
spends O
an O
extra O
money O
buying O
newspapers O
to O
receive O
the O
same O
, O
even O
usually O
less O
information O
than O
those O
he O
can O
have O
with O
the O
internet O
? O

The Arg-B
answer Arg-I
, Arg-I
perhaps Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
would Arg-I
rational Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
so Arg-I
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
reading Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
may Arg-I
continue Arg-I
falling Arg-I
sharply Arg-I
, Arg-I
possibly Arg-I
leading Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
close Arg-I
- Arg-I
downs Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
coming Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
when Arg-B
taking Arg-I
environment Arg-I
into Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
must Arg-I
conceive Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
are Arg-I
published Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
trees Arg-I
are Arg-I
cut Arg-I
down Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
simply Arg-I
the Arg-I
contributor Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
deforestation Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
happening Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
newspapers Arg-B
' Arg-I
production Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
environmentalists Arg-I
on Arg-I
its Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
alive Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
might O
be O
unpleasant O
for O
some O
advocating O
newspapers O
to O
witness O
the O
extinction O
of O
the O
type O
of O
media O
. O

However O
, O
this O
, O
if O

, O
should O
be O

as O
a O
result O
of O
the O

education O

which O
fosters O
a O
civilized O
society O
, O
plays O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
a O
country O
's O
long O
- O
lasting O
prosperity O
. O

It O
is O
no O
wonder O
that O
governments O
throughout O
the O
world O
lay O
special O
emphasis O
on O
education O
development O
. O

As O
for O
the O
two O
integral O
components O
within O
the O
system O
, O
elementary O
and O
advanced O
education O
, O
there O
's O
no O
doubt O
that O
a Arg-B
government Arg-I
is Arg-I
supposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
offer Arg-I
sufficient Arg-I
financial Arg-I
support Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
. O

Concerning O
that O
elementary Arg-B
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
the Arg-I
base Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
architecture Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
requirement Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
in Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
society Arg-I
, O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
that Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
equal Arg-I
and Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

So O
a Arg-B
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
established Arg-I
primary Arg-I
education Arg-I
goes Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
hand Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
illiteracy Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
interplay Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
compromises Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if Arg-B
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
the Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
determined Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
off Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
key Arg-I
points Arg-I
governments Arg-I
should Arg-I
set Arg-I
on Arg-I
agenda Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
educate Arg-I
more Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
future Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
through Arg-I
elementary Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
not O
enough O
, O
for Arg-B
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
represent Arg-I
the Arg-I
cutting Arg-I
edge Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
academic Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
, Arg-I
act Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
vanguard Arg-I
in Arg-I
economic Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
advance Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
high Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
new Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
applied Arg-I
into Arg-I
practice Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
lead Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
flourish Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
elevate Arg-I
its Arg-I
status Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
international Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
may Arg-I
argue Arg-I
that Arg-I
universities Arg-I
can Arg-I
support Arg-I
themselve Arg-I
well Arg-I
by Arg-I
donation Arg-I
or Arg-I
invention Arg-I
, O
but O
this Arg-B
argument Arg-I
is Arg-I
invalid Arg-I
. O

Researches Arg-B
into Arg-I
humanities Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
large Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
, O
what O
's O
more O
, O
government Arg-B
's Arg-I
big Arg-I
budget Arg-I
on Arg-I
universities Arg-I
may Arg-I
attract Arg-I
more Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
intellectuals Arg-I
and Arg-I
researchers Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
. O

From O
reasons O
listed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
safely O
draw O
the O
conclusion O
that O
, O
a Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
spare Arg-I
effort Arg-I
on Arg-I
young Arg-I
children Arg-I
education Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
universities Arg-I
, O
both Arg-B
are Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
brighter Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Roommates O
quality O
and O
their O
importance O
Much O
has O
been O
said O
about O
the O
importance O
about O
good O
roommates O
and O
how O
roommates O
will O
affect O
our O
life O
in O
school O
. O

Research O
showed O
that O
friends O
that O
we O
made O
in O
university O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
life O
time O
friends O
and O
this O
especially O
applicable O
to O
roommate O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
considered Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
communication Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
another Arg-I
essential Arg-I
particularity Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
. O

Consideration Arg-B
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
roommate Arg-B
turns Arg-I
down Arg-I
the Arg-I
music Arg-I
or Arg-I
television Arg-I
volume Arg-I
at Arg-I
night Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
done Arg-I
until Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
taste Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
all Arg-I
times Arg-I
, Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
's Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
before Arg-I
doing Arg-I
any Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
centered Arg-I
action Arg-I
would Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
tremendously Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
having Arg-B
a Arg-I
considered Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
is Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
imperative Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
school Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
a Arg-I
family Arg-I
member Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
communication Arg-B
is Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
making Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
have Arg-I
different Arg-I
habit Arg-I
in Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
tidy Arg-I
the Arg-I
blanket Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
might Arg-I
think Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
piece Arg-I
of Arg-I
cake Arg-I
while Arg-I
other Arg-I
would Arg-I
consider Arg-I
it Arg-I
as Arg-I
immense Arg-I
project Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
one Arg-I
requested Arg-I
to Arg-I
move Arg-I
out Arg-I
just Arg-I
because Arg-I
his Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
tidy Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
blanket Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
crying Arg-I
over Arg-I
split Arg-I
milk Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
communication Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
as O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
clear Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
misinterpretation Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
bonded Arg-I
are Arg-I
build Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
valuable O
factors O
about O
roommate O
that O
are O
important O
. O

Consideration Arg-B
and Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
personal Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
people O
might O
not O
get O
what O
they O
want O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
sky O
is O
the O
limit O
; O
there O
are O
all O
kinds O
of O
personality O
out O
there O
. O

We O
need O
to O
be O
flexible O
to O
be O
account O
into O
society O
. O

Should O
governments O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
improving O
roads O
and O
highways O
Nowadays O
transportation O
has O
attracted O
much O
social O
concern O
. O

Whether O
governments O
should O
invest O
more O
money O
in O
traffic O
infrastructure O
or O
focus O
more O
on O
developing O
public O
transportation O
has O
erupted O
endless O
controversy O
. O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
unreasonable O
to O
suggest O
that O
governments Arg-B
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
buses Arg-I
, Arg-I
trains Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
subways Arg-I
investment Arg-I
. O

Such Arg-B
public Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
serve Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
therefore O
they Arg-B
help Arg-I
alleviate Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
and Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
released Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
. O

Both O
these O
two O
things O
are O
important O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
carbon Arg-B
emission Arg-I
cut Arg-I
is Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
protecting Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
motorbikes Arg-I
are Arg-I
on Arg-I
roads Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
the Arg-I
ozone Arg-I
layer Arg-I
is Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
governments Arg-I
use Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
roads Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
strong Arg-I
likelihood Arg-I
that Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
drive Arg-I
their Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
sure Arg-I
to Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
emitted Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
cause Arg-I
skin Arg-I
cancer Arg-I
and Arg-I
destroy Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Whereas O
, O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
good Arg-I
buses Arg-I
, Arg-I
trains Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
subways Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
inclined Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
less Arg-I
private Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
decreases Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
released Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
the Arg-B
policy Arg-I
that Arg-I
concentrates Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
developing Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
brings Arg-I
an Arg-I
advantageous Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
earth Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
policy Arg-I
would Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
relieving Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
quiet Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
serious Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
this O
issue O
is O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
flowing Arg-I
on Arg-I
roads Arg-I
. O

In O
order O
to O
tackle O
the O
problem O
, O
governments Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
turn Arg-I
people Arg-I
' Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
public Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
motorbikes Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
that Arg-I
improving Arg-I
roads Arg-I
and Arg-I
highways Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
seem Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
the Arg-I
major Arg-I
cause Arg-I
of Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
concede O
that O
high Arg-B
- Arg-I
quality Arg-I
roads Arg-I
and Arg-I
highways Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
move Arg-I
around Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
public Arg-B
transportation Arg-I
systems Arg-I
even Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
ease Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
why O
many O
governments O
around O
the O
world O
invest O
more O
money O
on O
developing O
public O
transportation O
facilities O
. O

Physical O
exercise O

Although O
some O
people O
think O
that O
the O
major O
part O
of O
school O
schedule O
should O
be O
entirely O
devoted O
to O
academics O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
part Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
outweighed Arg-I
. O

Physical Arg-B
exercises Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
nation Arg-I
, Arg-I
assist Arg-I
to Arg-I
learning Arg-I
through Arg-I
direct Arg-I
observation Arg-I
and Arg-I
finally Arg-I
aid Arg-I
to Arg-I
financial Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
ancient O
Latin O
proverb O
says O
: O
" O
Anima O
sana O
in O
corpore O
sano O
" O
, O
which O
means O
that O
healthy Arg-B
body Arg-I
is Arg-I
basis Arg-I
for Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
soul Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
direct Arg-I
linkage Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
frequency Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
physical Arg-I
exercises Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
more Arg-I
we Arg-I
practice Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
better Arg-I
we Arg-I
feel Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
health Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
with Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
: Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
, Arg-I
step Arg-I
by Arg-I
step Arg-I
we Arg-I
change Arg-I
physical Arg-I
condition Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
nation Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
ages Arg-I
begin Arg-I
going Arg-I
for Arg-I
sports Arg-I
and Arg-I
try Arg-I
doing Arg-I
that Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
, Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
when Arg-B
we Arg-I
practice Arg-I
outdoors Arg-I
and Arg-I
indoors Arg-I
sports Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
are Arg-I
getting Arg-I
clearer Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
goes Arg-I
jogging Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
, Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
his Arg-I
own Arg-I
body Arg-I
through Arg-I
direct Arg-I
observation Arg-I
. O

Alike O
, O
the Arg-B
school Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
team Arg-I
gains Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
particular Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
throwing Arg-I
the Arg-I
ball Arg-I
into Arg-I
hoot Arg-I
practicing Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
learning Arg-I
theoretically Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
almost Arg-B
all Arg-I
natural Arg-I
science Arg-I
discoveries Arg-I
were Arg-I
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
direct Arg-I
observation Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Last O
, O
but O
not O
least O
, O
financial Arg-B
sustainability Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
region Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
the Arg-I
population Arg-I
is Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
money Arg-I
invested Arg-I
into Arg-I
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
program Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
allocations Arg-I
into Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
, O
since O
the Arg-B
nation Arg-I
is Arg-I
comparatively Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
. O

Along O
with O
that O
, O
physically Arg-B
healthy Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
more Arg-I
both Arg-I
into Arg-I
economical Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
the Arg-B
better Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
feels Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
better Arg-I
his Arg-I
brain Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
putting Arg-B
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
in Arg-I
early Arg-I
steps Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
development Arg-I
would Arg-I
finally Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
mentally Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

As O
hence O
it Arg-B
ends Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
financially Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
is Arg-I
withdrawn Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
of Arg-I
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
influence Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
on Arg-I
academic Arg-I
success Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Advance O
in O
transportation O
and O
communication O
like O
the O
airplane O
and O

Nowadays O

everyone O

on O
the O

as Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
results Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
, Arg-I
peoples Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
post Arg-I
their Arg-I
letters Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
payements Arg-I
were Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
weight Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
letters Arg-I
or Arg-I
boxes Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
may Arg-I
cause Arg-I
problem Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
post Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
delivered Arg-I
. O

But O
nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
take Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
email Arg-I
free Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
send Arg-I
their Arg-I
emails Arg-I
to Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
in Arg-I
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
besides Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
sure Arg-I
if Arg-I
their Arg-I
emails Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
delivered Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
important Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
on Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
transferring Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Today Arg-B
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
apply Arg-I
for Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
universities Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
than Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
sending Arg-I
email Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
using Arg-I
credit Arg-I
cards Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
all Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
fees Arg-I
online Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
advent Arg-I
of Arg-I
internet Arg-I
and Arg-I
online Arg-I
paying Arg-I
systems Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
many Arg-I
thing Arg-I
at Arg-I
your Arg-I
home Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
technological Arg-I
innovations Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
medical Arg-I
equipments Arg-I
. O

Biomedical Arg-B
engineers Arg-I
could Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
life Arg-I
expectancy Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
one Arg-B
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
was Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
heart Arg-I
valves Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
count Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
turning Arg-I
point Arg-I
in Arg-I
heart Arg-I
surgeries Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
time Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
used Arg-I
pig Arg-I
heart Arg-I
's Arg-I
valve Arg-I
to Arg-I
implant Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
the Arg-I
patient Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
alive Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
3 Arg-I
years Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
replacement Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
now Arg-I
, Arg-I
biomedical Arg-I
engineers Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
heart Arg-I
valves Arg-I
which Arg-I
works Arg-I
well Arg-I
and Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
can Arg-I
implant Arg-I
them Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
helped Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
its Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
. O

Technology O
inspires O
children O
's O
creativity O
instead O
of O
weakening O
it O

Technology O
accelerates O
human O
's O
evolving O
pace O
. O

With O
advanced O
technology O
, O
many O
things O
that O
seemed O
impossible O
in O
the O
past O
, O
have O
become O
realities O
. O

For O
example O
, O
people O
in O
the O
past O
never O
dreamed O
of O
talking O
to O
anyone O
whenever O
they O
wanted O
or O
see O
someone O
overseas O
on O
a O
computer O
screen O
, O
both O
of O
these O
can O
be O
achieved O
with O
cellphone O
and O
internet O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
point O
that O
technology O
has O
made O
children O
less O
creative O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
deny O
that O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
technology Arg-B
makes Arg-I
children Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
creative Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
technology Arg-B
inspires Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
are Arg-I
curious Arg-I
about Arg-I
everything Arg-I
around Arg-I
them Arg-I
, O
so O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
come Arg-I
across Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
product Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
cellphone Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
obsessed Arg-I
with Arg-I
its Arg-I
mysterious Arg-I
functions Arg-I
and Arg-I
eager Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
it Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Bill Arg-B
Gates Arg-I
was Arg-I
attracted Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
original Arg-I
huge Arg-I
computer Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
he Arg-I
did Arg-I
everything Arg-I
he Arg-I
could Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
how Arg-I
it Arg-I
worked Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
figured Arg-I
out Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
stuff Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
then Arg-I
began Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
invented Arg-I
a Arg-I
computer Arg-I
that Arg-I
was Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
and Arg-I
lightweight Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
interfering Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
, Arg-I
technology Arg-I
actually Arg-I
encourages Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
technology Arg-B
widen Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
were Arg-I
only Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
things Arg-I
from Arg-I
one Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
with Arg-B
highly Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
information Arg-I
from Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
and Arg-I
different Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
. O

Knowledge Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
base Arg-I
of Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
diverse Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
gained Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
inspires Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
made Arg-I
life Arg-I
too Arg-I
easy Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
comfortable Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
around Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
refuse Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
more Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
become Arg-I
obsessed Arg-I
with Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
products Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
kept Arg-I
researching Arg-I
new Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
successful Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
young Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

Lessons O
with O
teachers O
versus O
others O
sources O
Over O
the O
last O
half O
century O

the O
change O
in O
the O
life O
of O
human O
beings O
has O
increased O
beyond O
our O
wildest O
expectations O
. O

There O
are O
countless O
new O
technological O
equipments O
flooding O
into O
our O
lives O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Internet O
, O
television O
and O
cell O
phone O
. O

They O
all O
enrich O
our O
daily O
lives O
. O

Now O
, O
many O
students O
learn O
from O
Internet O
after O
class O
and O
they O
find O
it O
quite O
helpful O
. O

Many O
people O
find O
that O
students Arg-B
at Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
still Arg-I
learn Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
from Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
with Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

They O
argue O
that O
teachers Arg-B
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
write Arg-I
, Arg-I
read Arg-I
and Arg-I
calculate Arg-I
since Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
kindergarten Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
primary Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
further Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
writing Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
using Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
that Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
with Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
in Arg-I
schooling Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
students Arg-B
gain Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
through Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
right Arg-I
and Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Those O
who O
feel O
that O
students Arg-B
learn Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
sources Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
and Arg-I
television Arg-I
, O
firmly O
believe O
that O
within Arg-B
this Arg-I
sources Arg-I
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
learn Arg-I
in Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
input Arg-I
some Arg-I
key Arg-I
words Arg-I
and Arg-I
google Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
numberless Arg-I
articles Arg-I
and Arg-I
websites Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
students Arg-B
learn Arg-I
things Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
contend Arg-I
that Arg-I
good Arg-I
television Arg-I
programs Arg-I
do Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Discovery Arg-B
Channel Arg-I
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
instructive Arg-I
episodes Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
have Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
others Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
, Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
students Arg-B
learn Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
than Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
source Arg-I
. O

Because O
not O
only O
do O
teachers Arg-B
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
skills Arg-I
to Arg-I
tell Arg-I
right Arg-I
from Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
. O

Just O
imagine O
: O
if O
a O
student O
ca O
n't O
even O
make O
out O
whether O
the O
source O
is O
reasonable O
or O
not O
, O
then O
how O
can O
he O
get O
the O
right O
information O
to O
help O
him O
to O
learn O
? O

Email O

The O
introduction O
of O
email O
and O
text O
messaging O
has O
brought O
about O
considerable O
changes O
in O
communication O
. O

With O
this O
situation O
, O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
they Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
factors Arg-I
decreasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
position Arg-I
of Arg-I
written Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

I O
am O
in O
favor O
of O
that O
idea O
because O
of O
their O
advantages O
and O
the O
fact O
we O
can O
see O
today O
about O
the O
use O
of O
these O
new O
means O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
point Arg-I
out Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
users Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
from Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
text Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
answers Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
question Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
great Arg-I
popularity Arg-I
. O

Before Arg-B
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
communicated Arg-I
by Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
directly Arg-I
, Arg-I
sending Arg-I
letters Arg-I
or Arg-I
later Arg-I
, Arg-I
calling Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

Such Arg-B
ways Arg-I
usually Arg-I
made Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
troubles Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
expensiveness Arg-I
, Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
in Arg-I
far Arg-I
communication Arg-I
or Arg-I
emergency Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
loss Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
email Arg-B
and Arg-I
cell Arg-I
phones Arg-I
have Arg-I
improved Arg-I
the Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
above Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
send Arg-I
or Arg-I
receive Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
letters Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
and Arg-I
anytime Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

Especially O
, O
thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
function Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
text Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
( Arg-I
SMS Arg-I
) Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
and Arg-I
faster Arg-I
to Arg-I
transfer Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
population Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
them Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
popularity Arg-I
of Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
text Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
, Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
losing Arg-I
of Arg-I
written Arg-I
language Arg-I
's Arg-I
position Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
slangs Arg-I
and Arg-I
abbreviated Arg-I
words Arg-I
to Arg-I
shorten Arg-I
their Arg-I
writing Arg-I
and Arg-I
save Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

The O
outcome O
is O
that O
language Arg-B
in Arg-I
writing Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
its Arg-I
original Arg-I
form Arg-I
. O

Even O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
people Arg-B
compose Arg-I
a Arg-I
message Arg-I
with Arg-I
only Arg-I
emoticons Arg-I
( Arg-I
the Arg-I
expressions Arg-I
by Arg-I
face Arg-I
created Arg-I
by Arg-I
service Arg-I
providers Arg-I
) Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
room Arg-I
for Arg-I
writing Arg-I
or Arg-I
typing Arg-I
texts Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
that Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
use Arg-I
such Arg-I
new Arg-I
languages Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
studying Arg-I
, Arg-I
writing Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
that Arg-I
tendency Arg-I
continues Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
rapid Arg-I
pace Arg-I
, Arg-I
written Arg-I
language Arg-I
may Arg-I
face Arg-I
up Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
real Arg-I
problem Arg-I
about Arg-I
its Arg-I
stand Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
deny Arg-I
the Arg-I
threat Arg-I
from Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
text Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
status Arg-I
of Arg-I
written Arg-I
language Arg-I
because Arg-I
their Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
popularity Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
educators O
and O
individuals O
themselves O
, O
especially O
the O
youths O
should O
pay O
ore O
attention O
to O
this O
matter O
so O
that O
we O
can O
take O
advantages O
of O
the O
new O
language O
along O
with O
preserving O
the O
traditional O
one O
. O

Using O
animals O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
human O
beings O
With O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
the O
standard O
of O
people O

, O
increasing O
numbers O
of O

experiments O
are O
done O
, O
new O

for O

Some O
opponents O
says O
that O
it O
is O
cruel O
to O
animals O

nature O
, O
however O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
no O

person O
will O
deny O
that O
it Arg-B

a Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
cruel Arg-I
activity Arg-I

are Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
sold Arg-I
without Arg-I
testing Arg-I
on Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
discuss O
this O
issue O
from O
twofold O
aspects O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
we O
all O
know O
, O
animals Arg-B
are Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
and Arg-I
vital Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
, O
because O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
no Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
balance Arg-I
of Arg-I
nature Arg-I
will Arg-I
broke Arg-I
down Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
die Arg-I
out Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
animal Arg-I
experiments Arg-I
accelerate Arg-I
the Arg-I
vanishing Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
categories Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
doing Arg-B
this Arg-I
various Arg-I
testing Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
hazard Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
and Arg-I
next Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

Though O
animal Arg-B
experiments Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
balance Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
indisputable Arg-I
that Arg-I
every Arg-I
new Arg-I
kind Arg-I
food Arg-I
or Arg-I
pill Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
noxious Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
must Arg-I
do Arg-I
something Arg-I
to Arg-I
insure Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
invention Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
people Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
making Arg-I
people Arg-I
ill Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
dying Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
new Arg-I
foods Arg-I
or Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
are Arg-I
invented Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
quantity Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Thus O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
volunteers Arg-I
; Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
to Arg-I
test Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
foods Arg-I
or Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
potentially Arg-I
harm Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
testing Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
reaffirm O
that O
although O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
some Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
' Arg-I
profits Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
merits Arg-I
of Arg-I
animal Arg-I
experiments Arg-I
still Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
demerits Arg-I
. O

Television O
is O
the O
culprit O
for O
destroying O
communication O
between O
friends O
& O
family O

It O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
home O
that O
does O
not O
have O
a O
television O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
number O
of O
television O
channels O
and O
programs O
are O
increasing O
everyday O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
plan Arg-I
for Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
limitation Arg-I
or Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
for Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
with O
that O
idea O
that O
television Arg-B
devastate Arg-I
families Arg-I
ties Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
spite Arg-I
of Arg-I
enjoying Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
shows Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
time Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
task Arg-I
. O

Emergence Arg-B
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
television Arg-I
channels Arg-I
or Arg-I
shows Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
surprising Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
kill Arg-I
time Arg-I
by Arg-I
tracking Arg-I
these Arg-I
channels Arg-I
so Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
day Arg-I
we Arg-I
understand Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
late Arg-I
for Arg-I
doing Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
that Arg-I
suffers Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
call Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
parents Arg-I
or Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
I O
think O
watching Arg-B
television Arg-I
programs Arg-I
makes Arg-I
us Arg-I
lazy Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
usually Arg-I
spend Arg-I
our Arg-I
times Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
television Arg-I
for Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
three Arg-I
ours Arg-I
a Arg-I
day Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
come Arg-I
back Arg-I
home Arg-I
after Arg-I
eight Arg-I
- Arg-I
hour Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
office Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
we Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
for Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
activity Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
gym Arg-I
or Arg-I
doing Arg-I
other Arg-I
sports Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
makes Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
lazy Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
prefers Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
sedentary Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
shows Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
be Arg-I
active Arg-I
and Arg-I
sociable Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
some Arg-B
television Arg-I
programs Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
viewers Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
thriller Arg-I
or Arg-I
action Arg-I
movies Arg-I
advertise Arg-I
negative Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
doing Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
genre Arg-I
of Arg-I
programs Arg-I
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
usually Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
mimic Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
see Arg-I
on Arg-I
movies Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
daily Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
killing Arg-B
our Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
us Arg-I
lazy Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
negative Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
are Arg-I
just Arg-I
only Arg-I
few Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
how Arg-I
television Arg-I
is Arg-I
destructive Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
global Arg-I
problem Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
this Arg-I
problem Arg-I

and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
need Arg-I
global Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
solution Arg-I
. O

Gender O
Equality O
at O
university O
admission O

Nowadays O
men O
and O
women O
are O
equally O
participating O
in O
every O
field O
. O

Contrastingly O
, O
in O
the O
past O
time O
, O
women O
worked O
at O
home O
and O
performed O
sophisticated O
work O
. O

This O
factor O
is O
still O
affecting O
thinking O
of O
many O
people O
. O

They O
still O
believe O
that O
in O
present O
time O
women O
must O
do O
such O
type O
of O
work O
only O
. O

This O
tendency O
enforces O
universities O
to O
accept O
student O
according O
to O
the O
gender O
. O

Universities Arg-B
should Arg-I
accept Arg-I
equal Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
of Arg-I
both Arg-I
genders Arg-I
. O

Initially O
, O
if O
we O
look O
into O
the O
fact O
, O
women Arg-B
have Arg-I
proved Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
field Arg-I
whether Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
indoor Arg-I
or Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
women Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
home Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
sky Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
acting Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
housewife Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
flying Arg-I
planes Arg-I
also Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
university Arg-B
authority Arg-I
must Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
biased Arg-I
on Arg-I
ground Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
gender Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
must Arg-I
consider Arg-I
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
record Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
as Arg-I
main Arg-I
criteria Arg-I
of Arg-I
admission Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
current Arg-I
job Arg-I
market Arg-I
affects Arg-I
the Arg-I
decision Arg-I
of Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
university Arg-I
designs Arg-I
its Arg-I
courses Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
employers Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
job Arg-I
selection Arg-I
criteria Arg-I
are Arg-I
pre Arg-I
decided Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
employers Arg-B
need Arg-I
male Arg-I
candidates Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
work Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
repairing Arg-I
and Arg-I
installation Arg-I
of Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
machine Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
male Arg-I
staff Arg-I
for Arg-I
night Arg-I
shifts Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
want Arg-I
female Arg-I
candidates Arg-I
for Arg-I
soft Arg-I
natured Arg-I
work Arg-I
like Arg-I
counseling Arg-I
, Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
, Arg-I
designing Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
universities Arg-B
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
requirement Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
providers Arg-I
and Arg-I
decide Arg-I
subject Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
particular Arg-I
gender Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
universities Arg-B
must Arg-I
open Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
to Arg-I
select Arg-I
his Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

Our Arg-B
youth Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
very Arg-I
confident Arg-I
towards Arg-I
his Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
ready Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
bound Arg-I
in Arg-I
certain Arg-I
limitations Arg-I
. O

Female Arg-B
candidates Arg-I
also Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
care Arg-I
about Arg-I
any Arg-I
restriction Arg-I
posed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
employer Arg-I
. O

So O
we Arg-B
must Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
their Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Some O
young O
adults O
want O
independence O
from O
their O
parents O
quickly O
Many O
young O
adults O
want O
to O
get O
away O
from O
their O
parent O
's O
houses O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
have O
no O
limits O
, O
to O
be O
independent O
. O

But O
these O
young O
people O
do O
not O
take O
into O
account O
that O
their Arg-B
lives Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
bills Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
lodging Arg-I
or Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
where Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
less Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
tenant Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
houses Arg-I
will Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
live Arg-I
separate Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
loan Arg-I
, Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
, Arg-I
water Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
meal Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
still Arg-I
study Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
combine Arg-I
studying Arg-I
with Arg-I
working Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
everything Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
such Arg-I
worries Arg-I
when Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
home Arg-I
, O
because O
parents Arg-B
will Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents Arg-B
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
money Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
they Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
problem Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
may Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
tenant Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

His Arg-B
habits Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
totally Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
theirs Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
inappropriate Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
him Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
share Arg-I
a Arg-I
room Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
less Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
with Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
problem Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
tenant Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
interests Arg-I
and Arg-I
points Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
him Arg-I
for Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
most Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
quarrel Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
reckon O
that O
for Arg-B
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, O
because O
of O
the O
benefits O
they O
will O
have O
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
financial Arg-I
problems Arg-I
or Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
on Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
. O

Air O
pollution O
Air O
pollution O
is O
an O
issue O
threatening O
the O
environment O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
such O
as O
causing O
holes O
in O
the O
ozone O
and O
affecting O
global O
heating O
in O
the O
negative O
way O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
more Arg-B
responsibilities Arg-I
should Arg-I
put Arg-I
on Arg-I
private Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
and Arg-I
companies Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
paying Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
up Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
in Arg-B
most Arg-I
industrialized Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
companies Arg-I
that Arg-I
holds Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
factories Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
constitutions Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
waste Arg-I
products Arg-I
and Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
gases Arg-I
produced Arg-I
by Arg-I
these Arg-I
factories Arg-I
cause Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
these Arg-I
companies Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
considering Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
these Arg-I
companies Arg-I
were Arg-I
obliged Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
make Arg-I
an Arg-I
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
they Arg-I
cause Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
private Arg-B
individuals Arg-I
cause Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
ways Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
inessential Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
house Arg-I
heating Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
house Arg-I
heating Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
need Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
winter Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
households Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
consider Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
filters Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
heating Arg-I
causes Arg-I
. O

Instead O
of O
this O
, O
some Arg-B
expensive Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
cause Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
by Arg-B
charging Arg-I
private Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
for Arg-I
causing Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
will Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
restrict Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
products Arg-I
that Arg-I
cause Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
and Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

Governments Arg-B
also Arg-I
should Arg-I
use Arg-I
an Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
budgets Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
, Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
putting Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
companies Arg-I
and Arg-I
private Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
governments Arg-B
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
inhabitants Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
from Arg-I
cleaning Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, O
both Arg-B
companies Arg-I
and Arg-I
private Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
part Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

Young O
people O
should O
go O
to O
university O
or O
not O
Persistent O
deliberation O
is O
happening O
as O
to O
whether O
it O
is O
desirable O
for O
the O
youth O
to O
go O
to O
university O
. O

In O
regard O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
students O
to O
get O
high O
quality O
of O
education O
in O
universities O
, O
while O
others O
think O
that O
it O
is O
only O
one O
of O
causes O
to O
increase O
the O
rate O
of O
unemployment O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
analyze O
both O
views O
first O
in O
order O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
fool O
- O
proof O
decision O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
those O
who O
advocate O
the O
impracticability O
of O
university O
have O
several O
reasons O
. O

From O
their O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
certification Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
mechanics Arg-I
, Arg-I
sales Arg-I
persons Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
engineers Arg-I
, O
and O
, O
furthermore O
, O
labors Arg-B
for Arg-I
graduates Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
short Arg-I
supply Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
the Arg-B
labor Arg-I
market Arg-I
for Arg-I
highly Arg-I
educated Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
now Arg-I
too Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
after Arg-I
finishing Arg-I
their Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
regard O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
loss Arg-I
of Arg-I
national Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
that Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
spend Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
searching Arg-I
for Arg-I
high Arg-I
salary Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
sheer Arg-I
time Arg-I
- Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
are O
voices O
in O
the O
opposition O
, O
saying O
that O
universities Arg-B
provide Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
skills Arg-I
for Arg-I
careers Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
academic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
human Arg-I
race Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
bio Arg-I
science Arg-I
, Arg-I
politics Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
academic Arg-I
values Arg-I
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
progress Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
many Arg-B
researches Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
ivory Arg-I
- Arg-I
tower Arg-I
have Arg-I
created Arg-I
ingenious Arg-I
discoveries Arg-I
and Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Another O
significant O
factor O
of O
universities O
is O
that O
diverse Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
life Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
generation Arg-I
more Arg-I
competently Arg-I
because O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
chances Arg-I
through Arg-I
internships Arg-I
, Arg-I
deeper Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
, Arg-I
independent Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
exchange Arg-I
scholarships Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
both O
contentions O
about O
the O
necessity O
of O
universities O
' O
education O
have O
reasonable O
justifications O
; O
however O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
view O
. O

Although O
higher Arg-B
education Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
young Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
success Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
in Arg-I
universities Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
vital Arg-I
factor Arg-I
in Arg-I
creating Arg-I
more Arg-I
possibilities Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
through Arg-I
advancing Arg-I
academic Arg-I
fulfillment Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
generation Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
and Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
. O

Effects O
of O
mobile O
phones O
Nowadays O
, O
the O
popularity O
of O
mobile O
phones O
has O
brought O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
convenience O
but O
at O
the O
meanwhile O
a O
variety O
of O
problems O
as O
well O
, O
such O
as O
social O
, O
medical O
and O
technical O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
think Arg-I
these Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
will Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
brought Arg-I
by Arg-I
cell Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
analyze O
these O
three O
issues O
in O
order O
to O
support O
my O
viewpoint O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
almost Arg-B
everything Arg-I
that Arg-I
changed Arg-I
our Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
cause Arg-I
some Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Mobile O
phones O
are O
not O
out O
of O
expectation O
. O

Speaking Arg-B
loudly Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
phone Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
areas Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
and Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
appears Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
impolite Arg-I
and Arg-I
offensive Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
some Arg-B
students Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
their Arg-I
cell Arg-I
phones Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
effective Arg-I
cheating Arg-I
tools Arg-I
in Arg-I
examinations Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
send Arg-I
and Arg-I
receive Arg-I
answers Arg-I
by Arg-I
texting Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
these Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
some Arg-I
regulations Arg-I
and Arg-I
rules Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
implemented Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
some Arg-B
harmful Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
health Arg-I
are Arg-I
lethal Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
proved Arg-I
that Arg-I
overusing Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
devices Arg-I
including Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
could Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
higher Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
hearing Arg-I
loss Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
cancers Arg-I
, Arg-I
although Arg-I
the Arg-I
further Arg-I
investigation Arg-I
are Arg-I
needed Arg-I
. O

Another O
debatable O
problem O
is O
about O
techniques O
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
panic Arg-I
among Arg-I
people Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
intercepted Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
third Arg-I
party Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
possibility Arg-I
exists Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

But O
a Arg-B
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
reliable Arg-I
system Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
invented Arg-I
to Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
the Arg-I
private Arg-I
information Arg-I
of Arg-I
users Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
dispensable Arg-I
multifunctional Arg-I
tools Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
used Arg-I
for Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
also Arg-I
functions Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
browser Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
music Arg-I
player Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
organizer Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
overused O
without O
side O
effects O
. O

The Arg-B
contribution Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
is Arg-I
prominent Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
dependence Arg-I
on Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
irreversible Arg-I
, O
although O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
problems Arg-I
that Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
well Arg-I
handled Arg-I
. O

Computer O
has O
negative O
effects O
to O
children O
Nowadays O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
development O
of O
technology O
, O
computer O
is O
now O
indispensable O
to O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
computer O
is O
good O
for O
children O
and O
it O
should O
be O
used O
daily O
by O
children O
but O
some O
others O
think O
differently O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
latter O
opinion O
is O
true O
. O

First O
, O
using Arg-B
computer Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
has Arg-I
bad Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
they Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
computer Arg-I
for Arg-I
too Arg-I
long Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
tired Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
some Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
typically Arg-I
shortsighted Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
children Arg-B
who Arg-I
play Arg-I
games Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
on Arg-I
computer Arg-I
can Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
lack Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
know Arg-I
little Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
outside Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
that O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
online Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
bear Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
several Arg-B
teenagers Arg-I
play Arg-I
games Arg-I
without Arg-I
rest Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
depression Arg-I
, O
a Arg-B
typical Arg-I
example Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
death Arg-I
of Arg-I
Korean Arg-I
gamer Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
stop Arg-I
playing Arg-I
for Arg-I
3 Arg-I
days Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
even Arg-B
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
online Arg-I
game Arg-I
can Arg-I
still Arg-I
be Arg-I
negatively Arg-I
affected Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
computer Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
social Arg-I
surveys Arg-I
have Arg-I
shown Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
children Arg-I
use Arg-I
computer Arg-I
for Arg-I
studying Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
attracted Arg-I
by Arg-I
facebook Arg-I
, Arg-I
blog Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. Arg-I
instead Arg-I
. O

Due O
to O
this O
neglect O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
because O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
live Arg-I
without Arg-I
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
that Arg-I
computer Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
still Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
bad Arg-I
side Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

People O
should O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
properly O
to O
make O
it O
an O
effective O
tool O
because O
computer O
should O
be O
used O
not O
only O
for O
entertaining O
but O
also O
for O
working O
and O
studying O
purpose O
. O

Influence O
of O
large O
factories O
Nowadays O
, O
whether O
to O
establish O
large O
factories O
nearby O
housing O
areas O
has O
become O
a O
controversial O
issue O
in O
our O
society O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
case O
of O
economic O
development O
, O
industrial O
buildings O
are O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
modern O
society O
. O

However O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
people O
are O
against O
building O
a O
factory O
near O
their O
community O
because O
of O
pollution O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
building Arg-I
a Arg-I
factory Arg-I
will Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
the Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
brought Arg-I
by Arg-I
factories Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
factory Arg-I
can Arg-I
stimulate Arg-I
local Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
and Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
manufacture Arg-I
goods Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
demand Arg-I
of Arg-I
laborers Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
which Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
residents Arg-I
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
the Arg-B
factory Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
isolated Arg-I
, Arg-I
other Arg-I
industries Arg-I
and Arg-I
business Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
established Arg-I
, Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
in Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
of Arg-I
local Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
estate Arg-I
industry Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
boosted Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
' Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
main Arg-I
disadvantage Arg-I
is Arg-I
contamination Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
true Arg-I
that Arg-I
some Arg-I
area Arg-I
are Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
the Arg-I
dire Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
overdeveloping Arg-I
the Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
water Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
overcrowded Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
and Arg-I
medical Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
some Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
cities Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
are Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
various Arg-I
breathing Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
asthma Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
waste Arg-I
ashes Arg-I
and Arg-I
certain Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
substances Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
that Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
factories Arg-I
built Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
how Arg-B
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
building Arg-I
a Arg-I
factory Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
whether Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
most Arg-B
problems Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
avoidable Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
factories Arg-I
put Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
and Arg-I
great Arg-I
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
their Arg-I
waste Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
installation O
of O
manufacturing O
plant O
is O
a O
trend O
of O
industrialization O
for O
many O
countries O
. O

Its O
advantages O

Prepared O
Food O

Nowadays O
, O
more O
and O
more O
people O
begin O
to O
select O
prepared O
food O
as O
their O
daily O
meals O
, O
since O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
save Arg-I
time Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
money Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

However O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
that Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
food Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
about Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
influence Arg-I
result Arg-I
from Arg-I
utilizing Arg-I
the Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
ingredients Arg-I
, Arg-I
ignoring Arg-I
the Arg-I
nutrition Arg-I
of Arg-I
food Arg-I
and Arg-I
modifying Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
explain O
why O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
based O
on O
the O
three O
reasons O
above O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
to Arg-B
make Arg-I
their Arg-I
food Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
and Arg-I
taste Arg-I
delicious Arg-I
, Arg-I
almost Arg-I
every Arg-I
producer Arg-I
adds Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
ingredients Arg-I
in Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
food Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
now Arg-I
purchased Arg-I
by Arg-I
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Some O
ingredients Arg-B
being Arg-I
added Arg-I
have Arg-I
caused Arg-I
dire Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
some Arg-I
articles Arg-I
in Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
which Arg-I
report Arg-I
the Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
between Arg-I
certain Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
components Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
food Arg-I
and Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
easy Arg-B
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
cook Arg-I
foods Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
cooking Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
food Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
nutrition Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
cooking O
prepared O
food O
needs O
much O
less O
time O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
fresh O
food O
. O

Whereas Arg-B
some Arg-I
research Arg-I
has Arg-I
apparently Arg-I
demonstrated Arg-I
that Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
food Arg-I
is Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
enough Arg-I
nutrients Arg-I
we Arg-I
need Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
growing Arg-I
up Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
cooking O
is O
one O
of O
arts O
humans O
create O
. O

The Arg-B
more Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
food Arg-I
we Arg-I
eat Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
skills Arg-I
we Arg-I
lose Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
the Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
living Arg-I
pace Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
microwave Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
unique Arg-I
cooker Arg-I
that Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
dish Arg-I
in Arg-I
five Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
. O

But O
rare Arg-B
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
aware Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
has Arg-I
contributed Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
modification Arg-I
of Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
habits Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
cause Arg-I
the Arg-I
loss Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
custom Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
about Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
the Arg-B
invention Arg-I
of Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
foods Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
satisfies Arg-I
the Arg-I
demand Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
busy Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

Cooking O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
, O
contrarily O
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
for O
our O
health O
and O
culture O
. O

Financial O
aid O
to O
develop O
countries O
As O
is O
commonly O
understood O
, O
there O
is O
an O
increasingly O
gap O
between O
developed O
countries O
and O
developing O
countries O
. O

It O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
developed O
countries O
and O
organization O
are O
proving O
financial O
assistance O
to O
the O
impoverished O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
disagreed Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
assist Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
analyzing O
the O
necessity O
of O
developing O
their O
education O
and O
the O
real O
objective O
of O
supporters O
. O

Firstly O
, O
education Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
most Arg-B
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
are Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
educational Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
evaluation Arg-I
systems Arg-I
and Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
usually Arg-I
neglected Arg-I
by Arg-I
local Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
. O

From O
this O
example O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
developed Arg-I
countries Arg-I
are Arg-I
unwilling Arg-I
to Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
successful Arg-I
experience Arg-I
in Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
will Arg-I
remain Arg-I
undeveloped Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
they Arg-I
gain Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
economic Arg-I
support Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
critical Arg-I
method Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
condition Arg-I
of Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
build Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
complete Arg-I
educational Arg-I
system Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
financial Arg-I
aid Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
well O
acknowledged O
that O
there O
is O
no O
free O
lunch O
in O
the O
world O
. O

This O
means O
some Arg-B
powerful Arg-I
countries Arg-I
provide Arg-I
financial Arg-I
support Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
exploit Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
resources Arg-I
and Arg-I
target Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
labour Arg-I
market Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
they Arg-B
rarely Arg-I
provide Arg-I
local Arg-I
residents Arg-I
with Arg-I
any Arg-I
technological Arg-I
aid Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
cause Arg-I
contamination Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
developing Arg-B
countries Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
totally Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
financial Arg-I
support Arg-I
from Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
financial Arg-B
aid Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
assist Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

And O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
proven Arg-I
that Arg-I
developing Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
improving Arg-I
national Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
science Arg-I
level Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
path Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
undergo Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
really Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
alter Arg-I
current Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

Society O
should O
ban O
all O
forms O
of O
the O
advertising O

It O
is O
no O
secret O
that O
advertising O
become O
inseparable O
part O
of O
our O
modern O
life O
. O

We O
come O
across O
with O
ads O
almost O
everywhere O
and O
everyday O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
companies O
by O
advertising O
their O
goods O
or O
services O
spend O
their O
money O
for O
nothing O
. O

Other O
critics O
say O
that O
ads O
have O
no O
purpose O
, O
they O
only O
cause O
damages O
to O
society O
and O
all O
forms O
of O
advertising O
should O
be O
banned O
. O

On O
my O
part O
I O
would O
like O
to O
solve O
this O
issue O
on O
a O
different O
way O
. O

Society Arg-B
does Arg-I
need Arg-I
an Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
our Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
the Arg-I
content Arg-I
and Arg-I
what Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
we Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
offer Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
customers Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
do O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
advertising Arg-B
alcohol Arg-I
, Arg-I
cigarettes Arg-I
, Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
with Arg-I
adult Arg-I
content Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
prohibited Arg-I
because O
these Arg-B
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
ads Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effect Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Youngsters Arg-B
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
tempted Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
cigarettes Arg-I
or Arg-I
alcohol Arg-I
and Arg-I
later Arg-I
to Arg-I
start Arg-I
consume Arg-I
it Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
daily Arg-I
basis Arg-I
. O

Fortunately O
, O
some Arg-B
countries Arg-I
take Arg-I
this Arg-I
issue Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
and Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
alcohol Arg-I
, Arg-I
cigarettes Arg-I
and Arg-I
materials Arg-I
with Arg-I
adult Arg-I
content Arg-I
is Arg-I
banned Arg-I
on Arg-I
those Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
by Arg-B
advertising Arg-I
companies Arg-I
, Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
, Arg-I
firms Arg-I
and Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
promote Arg-I
their Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
ads Arg-I
we Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
new Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
compare Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
choose Arg-I
what Arg-I
’s Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
many Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
governments Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
tourism Arg-B
makes Arg-I
up Arg-I
one Arg-I
- Arg-I
third Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Czech Arg-I
Republic Arg-I
's Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
Czech Arg-I
government Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
advertise Arg-I
and Arg-I
sell Arg-I
its Arg-I
services Arg-I
to Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
well Arg-I
planned Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
targeted Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
more Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
modern Arg-B
society Arg-I
needs Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

Ads Arg-B
will Arg-I
keep Arg-I
us Arg-I
well Arg-I
informed Arg-I
about Arg-I
new Arg-I
products Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
, O
but O
we O
should O
also O
bear O
in O
mind O
that O
advertising Arg-B
cigarettes Arg-I
and Arg-I
alcohol Arg-I
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
affect Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
in Arg-I
negative Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Do O
married O
women O
usually O
work O
? O

Why O
and O
why O
not O
? O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
married Arg-B
women Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
have Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
up Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
like Arg-I
men Arg-I
when Arg-I
employment Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
gender Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
erased Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
. O

Working Arg-B
outside Arg-I
home Arg-I
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
both Arg-I
married Arg-I
woman Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
household Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
mention O
some O
basic O
reasons O
as O
following O
. O

Firstly O
, O
extra Arg-B
income Arg-I
that Arg-I
women Arg-I
earn Arg-I
will Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
's Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
taking Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
wife Arg-I
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
her Arg-I
family Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
in Arg-I
cases Arg-I
of Arg-I
her Arg-I
husband Arg-I
's Arg-I
low Arg-I
salary Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
job Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
present Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
normal Arg-I
practice Arg-I
for Arg-I
women Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
helpmates Arg-I
in Arg-I
earning Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
working Arg-B
outside Arg-I
the Arg-I
house Arg-I
creates Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
married Arg-I
women Arg-I
to Arg-I
contact Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
outer Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
strengthen Arg-I
their Arg-I
character Arg-I
and Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
confident Arg-I
, Arg-I
independent Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
women Arg-I
will Arg-I
set Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
example Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
play Arg-I
roles Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
mother Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
wife Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
nowadays O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
supporting Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
that Arg-I
help Arg-I
women Arg-I
balance Arg-I
housework Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Besides Arg-B
the Arg-I
gorvernment Arg-I
's Arg-I
policies Arg-I
on Arg-I
limited Arg-I
families Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
husbands Arg-I
' Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
housework Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
employers Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
offer Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
for Arg-I
women Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
organized Arg-I
home Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
the Arg-I
housewife Arg-I
's Arg-I
presence Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
day Arg-I
long Arg-I
and O
married Arg-B
women Arg-I
could Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
working Arg-I
life Arg-I
outside Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Government O
and O
education O
Primary O
and O
secondary O
education O
provide O
a O
basic O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
to O
the O
people O
in O
this O
world O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
that O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
those Arg-I
education Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
people Arg-I
; Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
like Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
or Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
fees Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
parents Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
university Arg-I
fees Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
think Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
fair Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
paying Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
primary Arg-I
and Arg-I
secondary Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
education Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
could Arg-I
receive Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
students Arg-B
that Arg-I
already Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
basic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
studies Arg-I
when Arg-I
their Arg-I
parent Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
pay Arg-I
the Arg-I
fees Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
build Arg-I
their Arg-I
characters Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
marketplace Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
this Arg-B
will Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
more Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
as O
they Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
some Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
too Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
completely O
agree O
that O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
fees Arg-I
because O
this Arg-B
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
both Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
charge Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
all Arg-I
their Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Alternative O
forms O
of O
transport O
to O
alleviate O
traffic O
congestion O

Recently O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
attention O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
means O
of O
transportation O
. O

Some O
state O
that O
automobile O
is O
the O
most O
convenient O
transportation O
, O
while O
others O
assert O
that O
alternative O
forms O
of O
transport O
should O
be O
considered O
in O
view O
of O
environmental O
pollution O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
alternative Arg-B
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
international Arg-I
laws Arg-I
in Arg-I
controlling Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
several O
reasons O
will O
be O
described O
carefully O
in O
the O
following O
passages O
. O

Firstly O
, O
an Arg-B
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
brings Arg-I
about Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

Since O
automobile Arg-B
exhaust Arg-I
and Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxides Arg-I
emission Arg-I
have Arg-I
bad Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
air Arg-I
gets Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
polluted Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
causes Arg-I
respiratory Arg-I
disease Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
inhabitants Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
alter Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
legislate Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
an Arg-B
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
causes Arg-I
terrible Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
. O

Once Arg-B
we Arg-I
get Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
forces Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
waste Arg-I
our Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
while Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
traffic Arg-B
congestion Arg-I
irritates Arg-I
drivers Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
increase Arg-I
of Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
methods Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
car Arg-I
ownership Arg-I
and Arg-I
use Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
planned Arg-I
and Arg-I
implemented Arg-I
. O

In O
order O
to O
solve O
these O
problems O
, O
alternative Arg-B
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
international Arg-I
laws Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
ownership Arg-I
and Arg-I
use Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
former O
, O
alternative Arg-B
forms Arg-I
which Arg-I
emit Arg-I
less Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxides Arg-I
and Arg-I
gasses Arg-I
than Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
are Arg-I
ideal Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
rental Arg-B
bicycle Arg-I
system Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
European Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
system Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
corner Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
district Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
rental Arg-I
bicycles Arg-I
are Arg-I
placed Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
ride Arg-I
it Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
districts Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
fee Arg-I
. O

Since O
bicycle Arg-B
expels Arg-I
neither Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxides Arg-I
nor Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
gasses Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
form Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
environment Arg-I
than Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
. O

As O
for O
the O
latter O
point O
, O
the Arg-B
introduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
international Arg-I
laws Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
also Arg-I
effective Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
regulations Arg-I
to Arg-I
limit Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
by Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
allow Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
possess Arg-I
one Arg-I
car Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
these Arg-B
attempts Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
can Arg-I
ease Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
and Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

In O
summary O
, O
even O
though O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
claim Arg-I
the Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
of Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
, O
I O
would O
state O
that O
alternative Arg-B
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
transport Arg-I
and Arg-I
international Arg-I
laws Arg-I
on Arg-I
controlling Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
protection Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
alleviation Arg-I
of Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
. O

Giving O
aid O
to O
poorer O
countries O
has O
more O
negative O
effects O
than O
positive O
effect O

In O
this O
world O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
does O
not O
know O
this O
world O
' O
globalization O
' O
, O
which O
means O
the O
world O
are O
more O
closer O
, O
and O
every O
single O
countries O
affects O
each O
other O
more O
than O
before O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

That O
is O
why O
governmental O
and O
non O
- O
governmental O
organizations O
have O
been O
focus O
on O
being O
harmony O
and O
contribute O
to O
aid O
to O
poor O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
just Arg-B
giving Arg-I
aid Arg-I
to Arg-I
impoverished Arg-I
countries Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
manipulated Arg-I
by Arg-I
big Arg-I
power Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a Arg-B
great Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
materials Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
have Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
being Arg-I
corrupted Arg-I
and Arg-I
politically Arg-I
dependent Arg-I
on Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
aiding Arg-B
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
has Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
, Arg-I
overweighing Arg-I
its Arg-I
side Arg-I
- Arg-I
effects Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
several Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
poor Arg-B
counties Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
of Arg-I
basic Arg-I
materials Arg-I
and Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
to Arg-I
start Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
richer Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
be Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
basic Arg-I
industry Arg-I
related Arg-I
factors Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
light Arg-I
, Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
, Arg-I
load Arg-I
, Arg-I
highways Arg-I
, Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
for Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

Aiding Arg-B
help Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
situation Arg-I
solve Arg-I
their Arg-I
economical Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
run Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

In O
actual O
, O
republic Arg-B
of Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
poorest Arg-I
country Arg-I
even Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
others Arg-I
in Arg-I
Africa Arg-I
in Arg-I
1960 Arg-I
's Arg-I
. O

Now Arg-B
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
became Arg-I
strong Arg-I
economy Arg-I
country Arg-I
aiding Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
after Arg-I
10 Arg-I
years Arg-I
of Arg-I
aid Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
counties Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
aiding Arg-B
campaign Arg-I
gives Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
considerate Arg-I
about Arg-I
poor Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
rich Arg-I
countries Arg-I
ponder Arg-I
poor Arg-I
people Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
from Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
and Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
never Arg-I
take Arg-I
their Arg-I
abundance Arg-I
for Arg-I
granted Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
raises Arg-I
the Arg-I
notice Arg-I
the Arg-I
meaning Arg-I
of Arg-I
harmony Arg-I
and Arg-I
love Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
humane Arg-I
doctrine Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
the Arg-B
campaigns Arg-I
might Arg-I
include Arg-I
practical Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
globalized Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
economies Arg-I
of Arg-I
several Arg-I
countries Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
network Arg-I
and Arg-I
must Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
America Arg-I
mortgage Arg-I
loan Arg-I
system Arg-I
went Arg-I
bad Arg-I
, Arg-I
several Arg-I
economies Arg-I
of Arg-I
European Arg-I
and Arg-I
Asian Arg-I
countries Arg-I
fluctuated Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
any Arg-I
countries Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
gotten Arg-I
international Arg-I
supports Arg-I
to Arg-I
block Arg-I
its Arg-I
bankrupt Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
abovementioned Arg-I
three Arg-I
key Arg-I
points Arg-I
of Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
of Arg-I
aid Arg-I
; Arg-I
supporting Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
its Arg-I
economy Arg-I
strong Arg-I
and Arg-I
building Arg-I
humane Arg-I
concepts Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
strong Arg-I
global Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
being Arg-B
a Arg-I
global Arg-I
neighbor Arg-I
by Arg-I
aiding Arg-I
poor Arg-I
countries Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
continues Arg-I
by Arg-I
many Arg-I
organizations Arg-I
and Arg-I
volunteers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
. O

Effects O
of O
globalization O
During O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world O
, O
every O
change O
has O
its O
own O
positive O
and O
negative O
sides O
. O

Globalization O
as O
a O
gradual O
change O
affecting O
all O
over O
the O
world O
is O
not O
an O
exception O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
undeniable O
effects O
on O
the O
economics O
of O
the O
world O
; O
it O
has O
side O
effects O
which O
make O
it O
a O
controversial O
issue O
. O

Some Arg-B
people Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
recognize Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
ethnic Arg-I
and Arg-I
religious Arg-I
values Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

They O
think O
that O
the Arg-B
idea Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
put Arg-I
their Arg-I
inherited Arg-I
culture Arg-I
in Arg-I
danger Arg-I
of Arg-I
uncontrolled Arg-I
change Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
vulnerable Arg-I
against Arg-I
the Arg-I
attack Arg-I
of Arg-I
imperialistic Arg-I
governments Arg-I
. O

Those O
who O
disagree O
, O
believe O
that O
globalization Arg-B
contribute Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
global Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

Developing Arg-B
globalization Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
scientific Arg-I
and Arg-I
economic Arg-I
promotions Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they Arg-B
admit Arg-I
that Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
their Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
stuffs Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
imported Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
proponents O
of O
globalization O
idea O
point O
out O
globalization Arg-B
results Arg-I
in Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
in Arg-I
global Arg-I
tension Arg-I
due O
to O
convergence Arg-B
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
natural Arg-I
consequence Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
rather Arg-I
classify Arg-I
myself Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
proponents Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
speeding Arg-I
factor Arg-I
of Arg-I
global Arg-I
progress Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
solve O
the O
problems O
of O
the O
world O
rather O
than O
intensifying O
them O
. O

Study O
at O
school O
or O
get O
a O
job O
? O

Many O
people O
believe O
that O
children O
should O
study O
at O
school O
to O
have O
more O
knowledge O
that O
prepare O
better O
for O
their O
future O
. O

Others O
, O
however O
, O
think O
that O
these O
children O
may O
disrupt O
their O
school O
work O
and O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
leave O
school O
early O
to O
find O
a O
job O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
point O
of O
view O
that O
student Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
schools Arg-B
offer Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
environment Arg-I
with Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
high Arg-I
quality Arg-I
programs Arg-I
for Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
creates Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
force Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
work Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
useless Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
schools Arg-B
provide Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
academic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
may Arg-I
learn Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
expand Arg-I
their Arg-I
understandings Arg-I
and Arg-I
gain Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
opprotunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
employer Arg-B
always Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
hire Arg-I
an Arg-I
employee Arg-I
of Arg-I
high Arg-I
degree Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
not O
unreasonable O
that O
some O
people O
think O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
interrupt Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Whether Arg-B
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
that Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
of Arg-I
little Arg-I
value Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
children Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
obtained Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Working Arg-B
helps Arg-I
children Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
esteem Arg-I
and Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
've Arg-I
earned Arg-I
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Even O
though O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
leaving Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, O
studying Arg-B
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
train Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

High O
sales O
reflect O
power O
of O
advertising O
and O
not O
the O
real O
need O

Nowadays O
, O
we O
can O
see O
advertisements O
everywhere O
, O
from O
television O
set O
to O
posters O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
these Arg-B
various Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
get Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
products Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
unnecessary Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
look Arg-I
good Arg-I
on Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

I O
tend O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

To Arg-B
boost Arg-I
their Arg-I
sales Arg-I
and Arg-I
win Arg-I
over Arg-I
customers Arg-I
, Arg-I
companies Arg-I
pour Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
into Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
function Arg-I
or Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
commodities Arg-I
themselves Arg-I

but Arg-I
really Arg-I
the Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
of Arg-I
possessing Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

By O
which O
I O
mean O
, O
huge Arg-B
cooperation Arg-I
hire Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
face Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
casting Arg-I
famous Arg-I
singers Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
television Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
, Arg-I
motorcycles Arg-I
or Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
sales Arg-I
increase Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
since O
youngsters Arg-B
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
target Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
, Arg-I
love Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
. O

Since O
having Arg-B
these Arg-I
products Arg-I
shows Arg-I
their Arg-I
status Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
quality Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
relatively Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
advertisements Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
falseful Arg-I
and Arg-I
exaggerated Arg-I
, O
it O
is O
also O
true O
that O
it Arg-B
plays Arg-I
and Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
economically Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
introduce Arg-I
new Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
provide Arg-I
various Arg-I
choices Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
mention Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
visually Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
, O
since O
they Arg-B
aim Arg-I
to Arg-I
grab Arg-I
your Arg-I
attention Arg-I
. O

Advertising Arg-B
also Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
prices Arg-I
at Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
levels Arg-I
, Arg-I
creates Arg-I
a Arg-I
fair Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
commercial Arg-I
competition Arg-I
. O

Otherwise Arg-B
the Arg-I
market Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
monopolistic Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
choice Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
so Arg-I
selective Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
power Arg-I
of Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
over Arg-I
- Arg-I
rated Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
deny Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
decision Arg-I
is Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
hands Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
. O

No O
matter O
how O
appealing O
the O
advertisements O
are O
, O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
on O
our O
own O
. O

Gun O
control O
Gun O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
kind O
of O
normal O
good O
in O
our O
society O
, O
which O
is O
strictly O
controlled O
in O
most O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
gun O
control O
in O
some O
countries O
is O
relatively O
loose O
than O
others O
. O

Therefore O
, O
this O
is O
still O
a O
controversial O
topic O
around O
the O
world O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
sensible Arg-I
to Arg-I
enforce Arg-I
the Arg-I
gun Arg-I
control Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
factor O
considered O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
accidents O
with O
guns O
. O

The Arg-B
accidents Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
completely Arg-I
avoided Arg-I
although Arg-I
only Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
gun Arg-I
licenses Arg-I
can Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
guns Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
we Arg-B
hear Arg-I
some Arg-I
news Arg-I
from Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
time Arg-I
that Arg-I
someone Arg-I
was Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
by Arg-I
accident Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
hunting Arg-I
. O

So O
the Arg-B
fewer Arg-I
guns Arg-I
possessed Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
fewer Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
would Arg-I
happened Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
surroundings Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
safer Arg-I
with Arg-I
lower Arg-I
accident Arg-I
rates Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
most Arg-B
violent Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
are Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
abuse Arg-I
of Arg-I
guns Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
countries Arg-I
where Arg-I
guns Arg-I
are Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Eventually O
, O
guns Arg-B
will Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
violent Arg-I
society Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
trend Arg-I
continues Arg-I
. O

Take O
an O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
American Arg-I
, Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
juveniles Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
guns Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
tragedies Arg-I
of Arg-I
school Arg-I
gun Arg-I
shooting Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
worse O
, O
some Arg-B
terrorists Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
possess Arg-I
more Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
always Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
danger Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
the Arg-B
possession Arg-I
of Arg-I
guns Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
raise Arg-I
the Arg-I
rates Arg-I
of Arg-I
suicide Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
US Arg-I
, Arg-I
firearms Arg-I
remain Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
common Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I
suicide Arg-I
, Arg-I
accounting Arg-I
for Arg-I
about Arg-I
50 Arg-I
per Arg-I
cent Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
trend Arg-I
of Arg-I
adolescent Arg-I
suicides Arg-I
and Arg-I
suicides Arg-I
among Arg-I
those Arg-I
age Arg-I
75 Arg-I
and Arg-I
over Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
considering Arg-B
the Arg-I
rise Arg-I
in Arg-I
accident Arg-I
rates Arg-I
, Arg-I
violent Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rates Arg-I
and Arg-I
suicide Arg-I
rates Arg-I
, O
I O
support O
that O
the Arg-B
guns Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
strictly Arg-I
limited Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
enforce Arg-I
a Arg-I
series Arg-I
of Arg-I
laws Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
our Arg-I
societies Arg-I
from Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

International O
sporting O
occasions O
help O
to O
ease O
international O
tensions O
International O
sporting O
events O
are O
a O
good O
change O
to O
create O
a O
multi O
- O
nation O
community O
of O
fans O
having O
the O
same O
passion O
. O

It O
will O
help O
people O
around O
the O
world O
understand O
each O
other O
more O
. O

Since O
, O
international Arg-B
sporting Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
in Arg-I
easing Arg-I
international Arg-I
tensions Arg-I
and Arg-I
releasing Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
safe Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
international Arg-I
sporting Arg-I
event Arg-I
is Arg-I
normal Arg-I
held Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
with Arg-I
huge Arg-I
interest Arg-I
from Arg-I
fans Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
nationality Arg-I
, Arg-I
origin Arg-I
and Arg-I
religion Arg-I
will Arg-I
live Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
useful Arg-I
to Arg-I
ease Arg-I
tensions Arg-I
between Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
in Arg-B
FIFA Arg-I
World Arg-I
Cup Arg-I
2010 Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
relation Arg-I
between Arg-I
North Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
and Arg-I
South Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
is Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
warship Arg-I
sinking Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
world Arg-I
suspected Arg-I
North Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
action Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
due Arg-B
to Arg-I
this Arg-I
event Arg-I
North Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
showed Arg-I
a Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
and Arg-I
enthuasism Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
rare Arg-I
times Arg-I
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
this Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
really Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
alleviate Arg-I
the Arg-I
tension Arg-I
. O

Besides O
easing O
tensions O
, O
an Arg-B
international Arg-I
sporting Arg-I
event Arg-I
also Arg-I
helps Arg-I
fans Arg-I
release Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
safe Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
they Arg-I
garther Arg-I
together Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
their Arg-I
team Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
. O

Regardless Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
competition Arg-I
between Arg-I
teams Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
released Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
safe Arg-I
way Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
sole Arg-I
passion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
sport Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
all Arg-B
fans Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
sport Arg-I
event Arg-I
will Arg-I
attract Arg-I
the Arg-I
attention Arg-I
of Arg-I
whole Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
media Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
image Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
land Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
Olympic Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
2008 Arg-I
, Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
tried Arg-I
thier Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
bring Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
a Arg-I
spectacular Arg-I
image Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
foreigners Arg-B
came Arg-I
here Arg-I
always Arg-I
received Arg-I
the Arg-I
support Arg-I
of Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
volunteers Arg-I
who Arg-I
were Arg-I
young Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
were Arg-I
welcomed Arg-I
by Arg-I
each Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
hospitality Arg-I
, Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

Everythings Arg-B
is Arg-I
created Arg-I
by Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
of Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
who Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
China Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
International Arg-B
sporting Arg-I
events Arg-I
will Arg-I
draw Arg-I
the Arg-I
international Arg-I
concern Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
more Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
by Arg-I
easing Arg-I

Technology O
that O
widen O
the O
gap O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
? O

Technology O
, O
in O
the O
past O
two O
hundred O
years O
, O
has O
taken O
a O
dramatic O
progress O
in O
many O
fields O
of O
our O
society O
, O
such O
as O
telecommunications O
, O
manufacturing O
and O
buildings O
, O
etc O
. O

Certainly O
, O
technologies O
have O
also O
contributed O
to O
the O
great O
change O
of O
our O
daily O
lives O
. O

However O
, O
today O
some O
people O
consider O
that O
the O
range O
of O
technology O
regarding O
of O
public O
has O
a O
negative O
effect O
on O
increasing O
the O
gap O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
by O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

In O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
progress Arg-I
of Arg-I
material Arg-I
technology Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
sharp Arg-I
fall Arg-I
of Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
products Arg-I
. O

About Arg-B
ten Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
, Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
ware Arg-I
very Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
members Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
of Arg-I
rich Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

Today Arg-B
, Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
common Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
household Arg-I
items Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
materials Arg-I
and Arg-I
better Arg-I
producing Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
most Arg-B
members Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
of Arg-I
technical Arg-I
advancements Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
the Arg-I
poor Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
technical Arg-B
developments Arg-I
improve Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
escape Arg-I
from Arg-I
daily Arg-I
chores Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
invest Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
energy Arg-I
in Arg-I
studying Arg-I
and Arg-I
living Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
meaningful Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
and Arg-I
conveniences Arg-I
which Arg-I
it Arg-I
brings Arg-I
about Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
past O
time O
, O
we Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
searching Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
waiting Arg-I
for Arg-I
letters Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
who Arg-I
lived Arg-I
far Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
talk Arg-I
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
online Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
where Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
far Arg-I
between Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
Internet Arg-I
gives Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
information Arg-I
, O
this Arg-B
therefore Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
greater Arg-I
equality Arg-I
between Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
everything O
has O
two O
sides O
and O
technology O
is O
not O
an O
exception O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
the Arg-B
gap Arg-I
between Arg-I
rich Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
poor Arg-I
is Arg-I
widen Arg-I
by Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, O
because O
only Arg-B
the Arg-I
rich Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
afford Arg-I
the Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
these Arg-I
products Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
in Arg-I
return Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
limp Arg-I
opposition Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
root Arg-I
cause Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
gap Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
good Arg-I
technology Arg-I
bringing Arg-I
to Arg-I
us Arg-I
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
. O

Under Arg-B
proper Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
and Arg-I
perpetually Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
advancement Arg-I
of Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Why O
should O
human O
beings O
travel O
to O
outer O
space O
? O

For O
many O
centuries O
, O
outer O
space O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
favourable O
realms O
of O
study O
. O

Space O
expeditions O
have O
been O
launched O
and O
many O
have O
been O
successful O
. O

However O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
still O
consider O
space O
exploration O
as O
an O
act O
of O
wasting O
money O
, O
to O
illustrate O
, O
astronauts O
only O
brought O
useless O
rocks O
back O
to O
planet O
earth O
despite O
the O
large O
sum O
of O
money O
spent O
on O
their O
equipment O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
to Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
many Arg-B
facts Arg-I
about Arg-I
solar Arg-I
system Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
discovered Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
picture Arg-I
of Arg-I
planet Arg-I
earth Arg-I
proved Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
is Arg-I
round Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
flat Arg-I
. O

Another O
example O
is O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
which Arg-I
goes Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
sun Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
vice Arg-I
versa Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
space Arg-I
exploration Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
would Arg-I
never Arg-I
know Arg-I
these Arg-I
facts Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
know Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
planet Arg-I
earth Arg-I
itself Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
observing Arg-I
planet Arg-I
earth Arg-I
from Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
find Arg-I
out Arg-I
ample Arg-I
things Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
planet Arg-I
earth Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
this Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
something Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
earth Arg-I
hazards Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
a Arg-B
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
sophisticated Arg-I
technology Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
invented Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
astronauts Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
to Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
which Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
any Arg-I
oxygen Arg-I
to Arg-I
breathe Arg-I
in Arg-I
, Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
are Arg-I
compelled Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
research Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
oxygen Arg-I
tanks Arg-I
. O

Oxygen Arg-B
tanks Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
proved Arg-I
useful Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
underwater Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
spaceships Arg-B
, Arg-I
communication Arg-I
satellites Arg-I
and Arg-I
space Arg-I
pens Arg-I
also Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
human Arg-B
beings Arg-I
should Arg-I
travel Arg-I
to Arg-I
outer Arg-I
space Arg-I
. O

In O
spite O
of O
costing O
a O
fortune O
, O
space O
exploration O
has O
given O
aforementioned O
benefits O
. O

Benefits O
of O
students O
doing O
extra O
jobs O

In O
present O
day O
and O
age O
, O
students O
are O
normally O
exposed O
to O
extra O
jobs O
as O
early O
as O
they O
start O
their O
university O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
, O
although O
in O
some O
extents O
, O
are O
proved O
to O
have O
negative O
effects O
, O
I O
feel O
strongly O
that O
the O
disadvantages O
are O
far O
outweighed O
by O
the O
advantages O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
some O
of O
the O
benefits O
surrounding O
this O
matter O
will O
be O
carefully O
explained O
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
undoubtedly Arg-I
certain Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
their Arg-I
practical Arg-I
experience Arg-I
by Arg-I
getting Arg-I
involved Arg-I
extra Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Part Arg-B
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
furnish Arg-I
them Arg-I
with Arg-I
precious Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
practice Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
learning Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
that Arg-B
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
the Arg-I
present Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
of Arg-I
sufficiently Arg-I
practical Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
supplied Arg-I
in Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
get Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
have Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
academic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
hands Arg-I
- Arg-I
on Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
having Arg-B
experienced Arg-I
in Arg-I
working Arg-I
environment Arg-I
during Arg-I
student Arg-I
time Arg-I
offers Arg-I
a Arg-I
distinct Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
apply Arg-I
for Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
after Arg-I
their Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
take Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
more Arg-I
confident Arg-I
and Arg-I
independent Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
constant Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
daily Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
environment Arg-I
where Arg-I
their Arg-I
new Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
raised Arg-I
without Arg-I
hesitation Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
gained Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
working Arg-B
conditions Arg-I
require Arg-I
students Arg-I
the Arg-I
independency Arg-I
in Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
, Arg-I
working Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
solving Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
characteristic Arg-I
is Arg-I
applied Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
doing Arg-B
extra Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
helps Arg-I
student Arg-I
with Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
high Arg-B
studying Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
, Arg-I
added Arg-I
with Arg-I
raising Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
are Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
burden Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
they Arg-I
earn Arg-I
from Arg-I
extra Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
normally Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
much Arg-I
, Arg-I
those Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
partially Arg-I
solved Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
that Arg-B
helps Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
reliant Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
condition Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
independent Arg-I
later Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
feel O
certain O
that O
having Arg-B
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
during Arg-I
your Arg-I
student Arg-I
time Arg-I
will Arg-I
offer Arg-I
students Arg-I
many Arg-I
clear Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
taking Arg-I
on Arg-I
an Arg-I
extra Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
partly Arg-I
alleviate Arg-I
some Arg-I
their Arg-I
problematic Arg-I
matters Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
working Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
and Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
my O
belief O
the O
tendency O
of O
getting O
extra O
jobs O
will O
increase O
more O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Benefits O
of O
students O
' O
unpaid O
work O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
essay O
is O
to O
discuss O
what O
can O
students O
and O
the O
organizations O
benefit O
from O
the O
activity O
that O
the O
students O
sent O
by O
their O
schools O
to O
work O
for O
companies O
without O
salaries O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
start O
by O
analyzing O
the O
advantages O
for O
doing O
this O
for O
both O
students O
and O
companies O
, O
and O
then O
I O
would O
draw O
a O
conclusion O
at O
the O
end O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
invaluable Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
working Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
assigned Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
most Arg-I
school Arg-I
curriculums Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
courses Arg-I
are Arg-I
theoretical Arg-I
and Arg-I
often Arg-I
by Arg-I
instructors Arg-I
speaking Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students Arg-B
might Arg-I
have Arg-I
little Arg-I
idea Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
true Arg-I
situation Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
enter Arg-I
the Arg-I
workforce Arg-I
after Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the Arg-B
internship Arg-I
, Arg-I
although Arg-I
without Arg-I
pay Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
money Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
buy Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
companies Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
unpaid Arg-I
interns Arg-I
can Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
save Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
younger Arg-I
generations Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
generate Arg-I
new Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
bound Arg-I
to Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
workload Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
greater Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
essentially Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
making Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
or Arg-I
slogan Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
start Arg-I
looking Arg-I
for Arg-I
potential Arg-I
employees Arg-I
and Arg-I
begin Arg-I
the Arg-I
training Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
companies Arg-B
save Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
resources Arg-I
for Arg-I
searching Arg-I
new Arg-I
staffs Arg-I
and Arg-I
organizing Arg-I
an Arg-I
orientation Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
outside Arg-I
the Arg-I
textbook Arg-I
and Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
real Arg-I
working Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
for Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
whereas Arg-I
organizations Arg-I
earn Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
save Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
enlightened Arg-I
by Arg-I
what Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
say Arg-I
. O

Sporting O
events O
easing O
international O
tensions O
, O
releasing O
patriotic O
feelings O
For O
most O
folks O
on O
Earth O
, O
the O
need O
to O
gather O
in O
one O
place O
, O
and O
enjoy O
competition O
with O
other O
talented O
people O
from O
different O
cultures O
through O
popular O
games O
has O
always O
been O
a O
strong O
motivation O
. O

This O
trend O
is O
so O
deeply O
engraved O
in O
people O
's O
mind O
that O
the O
organisation O
of O
such O
events O
continue O
to O
be O
planned O
, O
even O
when O
some O
participants O
are O
facing O
grievous O
social O
problems O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
large Arg-B
scale Arg-I
sports Arg-I
games Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
contests Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
international Arg-I
disputes Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
being Arg-I
proud Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

This O
will O
be O
proved O
by O
analysing O
how O
sports O
events O
may O
be O
an O
important O
link O
to O
the O
peace O
, O
and O
by O
how O
they O
encourage O
people O
to O
display O
their O
national O
symbols O
. O

Firstly O
, O
during Arg-B
times Arg-I
of Arg-I
war Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
badly Arg-I
affected Arg-I
countries Arg-I
can Arg-I
forget Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
gloomy Arg-I
environment Arg-I
and Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
a Arg-I
link Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
rest Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
by Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
international Arg-I
sports Arg-I
event Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
Irak Arg-I
was Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
struck Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
Second Arg-I
Gulf Arg-I
War Arg-I
, Arg-I
its Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
catch Arg-I
any Arg-I
incoming Arg-I
news Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
FootballWorld Arg-I
Cup Arg-I
through Arg-I
their Arg-I
portable Arg-I
receivers Arg-I
. O

This O
clearly O
shows O
that O
international Arg-B
sports Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
put Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
come Arg-I
back Arg-I
, Arg-I
sooner Arg-I
or Arg-I
later Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
relative Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
normality Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
world Arg-B
sports Arg-I
events Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
pulling Arg-I
back Arg-I
people Arg-I
towards Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
and Arg-I
peace Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
these Arg-B
sporting Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
proud Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when Arg-B
the Arg-I
Football Arg-I
World Arg-I
Cup Arg-I
was Arg-I
organised Arg-I
in Arg-I
South Arg-I
Africa Arg-I
, Arg-I
its Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
filled Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadiums Arg-I
, Arg-I
cheered Arg-I
and Arg-I
waved Arg-I
national Arg-I
flags Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
their Arg-I
national Arg-I
team Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

South Arg-B
African Arg-I
national Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
songs Arg-I
were Arg-I
played Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
streets Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
the Arg-I
night Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
example Arg-I
demonstrates Arg-I
how Arg-I
people Arg-I
might Arg-I
take Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
elements Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
roots Arg-I
and Arg-I
history Arg-I
to Arg-I
proudly Arg-I
display Arg-I
them Arg-I
while Arg-I
supporting Arg-I
their Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
freely Arg-I
express Arg-I
their Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
during Arg-I
international Arg-I
sports Arg-I
events Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
after O
analysing O
the O
effects O
of O
world O
games O
both O
for O
countries O
at O
war O
and O
for O
organising O
countries O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
constitute Arg-I
a Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
appeal Arg-I
towards Arg-I
a Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
guide Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
demonstrations Arg-I
of Arg-I
national Arg-I
proudness Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
true Arg-I
for Arg-I
centuries Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
not Arg-I
change Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
foreseeable Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Government O
should O
make O
more O
effort O
to O
promote O
alternative O
sources O
of O
energy O

The O
increasing O
population O
and O
the O
technological O
advancements O
demand O
more O
energy O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
there O
are O
various O
other O
resources O
such O
as O
the O
nuclear O
and O
solar O
which O
are O
abundant O
and O
eco O
- O
friendly O
. O

I O
will O
analyze O
these O
areas O
in O
the O
essay O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
major Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
today Arg-I
is Arg-I
water Arg-I
. O

Although O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
water Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
to Arg-I
generate Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
still Arg-I
rely Arg-I
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
this Arg-I
source Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
generate Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
vast Arg-I
energy Arg-I
the Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
falling Arg-I
short Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
during Arg-B
summer Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
power Arg-I
cut Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
India Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
, Arg-I
solar Arg-I
or Arg-I
wind Arg-I
energy Arg-I
there Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
any Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
distributing Arg-I
the Arg-I
required Arg-I
amount Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
implication Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
generate Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
available Arg-I
sources Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
sources Arg-I
most Arg-I
widely Arg-I
used Arg-I
currently Arg-I
to Arg-I
generate Arg-I
power Arg-I
releases Arg-I
extensive Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
gases Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
which Arg-I
increases Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
solar Arg-I
cooker Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
electric Arg-I
cooker Arg-I
would Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
energy Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
alternative Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
hydro Arg-I
- Arg-I
kinetic Arg-I
energy Arg-I
causes Arg-I
less Arg-I
atmospheric Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
implication Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
other Arg-I
sources Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
available Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
which Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
would Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

Further O
, O
government O
should O
motivate O
and O
encourage O
the O
people O
to O
use O
alternative O
sources O
such O
as O
the O
solar O
and O
the O
nuclear O
energy O
. O

Should O
governments O
be O
responsible O
to O
help O
the O
unemployed O
and O
homeless O
Unemployment O
is O
clearly O
a O
global O
problem O
, O
be O
it O
in O
developed O
countries O
or O
developing O
ones O
. O

However O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
believe O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
disadvantaged Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
, Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
out Arg-I
. O

Government Arg-B
money Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
publicly Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
programs Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

Tax Arg-B
revenue Arg-I
is Arg-I
collected Arg-I
from Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

Spending Arg-B
them Arg-I
on Arg-I
helping Arg-I
those Arg-I
not Arg-I
make Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
society Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
sound Arg-I
fair Arg-I
to Arg-I
tax Arg-I
payers Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
other Arg-I
pressing Arg-I
demands Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
expenditure Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
service Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
, O
so O
addressing Arg-B
unemployment Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
low Arg-I
priority Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
, O
to Arg-B
survive Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
equip Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
get Arg-I
free Arg-I
financial Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
out Arg-I
any Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
mean Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
leave Arg-I
alone Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
need Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
already Arg-I
in Arg-I
reverse Arg-I
circumstances Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
rather Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
overcome Arg-I
the Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
without Arg-I
external Arg-I
support Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
ought Arg-I
to Arg-I
set Arg-I
up Arg-I
free Arg-I
vocational Arg-I
trainings Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
interest Arg-I
- Arg-I
free Arg-I
bank Arg-I
loans Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
whole Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
jobless Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
again Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
my O
point O
of O
view O
is O
that O
, O
although O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
help Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
disadvantaged Arg-I
people Arg-I
, O
direct Arg-B
financial Arg-I
support Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
wise Arg-I
option Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
adversity Arg-I
. O

True O
function O
of O
a O
university O
Universities O
have O
quickly O
become O
the O
places O
to O
go O
when O
people O
seek O
to O
further O
develop O
their O
expertise O
. O

Whether O
this O
really O
suits O
the O
needs O
of O
their O
potential O
employers O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
as O
universities O
nowadays O
have O
evolved O
as O
a O
domain O
of O
experts O
: O
where O
more O
and O
more O
is O
known O
about O
less O
and O
less O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
among O
the O
vast O
range O
of O
choices O
offered O
there O
are O
often O
some O
training O
courses O
that O
have O
direct O
implications O
on O
job O
- O
seeking O
and O
other O
aspects O
in O
everyday O
life O
. O

However O
, O
although O
I O
respect O
the O
universities O
' O
aim O
of O
providing O
such O
courses O
to O
develop O
skills O
required O
for O
work O
and O
support O
their O
cause O
, O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
the O
main O
or O
best O
function O
of O
a O
university O
. O

A Arg-B
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
common Arg-I
sense Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
medium Arg-I
for Arg-I
conveying Arg-I
or Arg-I
providing Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
meant O
by O
this O
is O
that O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
ones Arg-I
universities Arg-I
should Arg-I
really Arg-I
cater Arg-I
for Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
employers Arg-I
, O
as O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
ones Arg-I
here Arg-I
to Arg-I
seek Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

High Arg-B
school Arg-I
graduates Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
further Arg-I
educate Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
universities Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
different Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
: Arg-I
a Arg-I
degree Arg-I
that Arg-I
's Arg-I
more Arg-I
widely Arg-I
accepted Arg-I
, Arg-I
gain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
insight Arg-I
into Arg-I
an Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
simply Arg-I
deepen Arg-I
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
interests Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
universities Arg-B
are Arg-I
regarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
where Arg-I
abundant Arg-I
educational Arg-I
resources Arg-I
gather Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
course Arg-I
or Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
training Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
offered Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
instead Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
available Arg-I
when Arg-I
needed Arg-I
. O

So O
the O
truth O
lies O
somewhere O
closer O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
a Arg-B
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
offer Arg-I
selected Arg-I
courses Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
employers Arg-I
' Arg-I
taste Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
main Arg-I
function Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
remains Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
provision Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
resources Arg-I
. O

It O
would O
be O
helpful O
, O
however O
, O
if O
certain O
courses O
concerning O
workplace O
skills O
can O
also O
be O
made O
available O
to O
students O
to O
help O
shape O
their O
futures O
. O

Zoos O
should O
be O
built O
to O
protect O
rural O
animals O
Preserving O
wild O
animals O
in O
zoos O
is O
an O
issue O
which O
frequently O
generates O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
heated O
debate O
, O
with O
supporters O
maintaining O
that O
wild O
life O
would O
be O
taken O
good O
care O
from O
professionals O
, O
while O
opponents O
claim O
that O
the O
animals O
are O
deprived O
of O
freedom O
as O
a O
result O
of O
staying O
in O
zoos O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
animals Arg-B
should Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
of Arg-I
wild Arg-I
species Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
environment Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

Given Arg-B
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
severe Arg-I
damage Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
our Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
natural Arg-I
and Arg-I
safe Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
animals Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
the Arg-B
limited Arg-I
space Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
trees Arg-I
and Arg-I
lakes Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
fully Arg-I
compensate Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
loss Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
if Arg-B
rural Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
captured Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
period Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
influences Arg-I
on Arg-I
both Arg-I
the Arg-I
physical Arg-I
and Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
status Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the Arg-B
wild Arg-I
species Arg-I
would Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
isolation Arg-I
and Arg-I
depression Arg-I
. O

It O
seems O
that O
zoos Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
killer Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
a Arg-I
protector Arg-I
in Arg-I
protecting Arg-I
wild Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
supporters O
would O
argue O
that O
zoos Arg-B
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
with Arg-I
modern Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
professionals Arg-I
, Arg-I
would Arg-I
provide Arg-I
better Arg-I
care Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
inside Arg-I
. O

They O
further O
point O
out O
that O
the Arg-B
endangered Arg-I
species Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
in Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
would Arg-I
never Arg-I
die Arg-I
of Arg-I
illegal Arg-I
hunting Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
the Arg-B
strict Arg-I
laws Arg-I
prohibiting Arg-I
poaching Arg-I
would Arg-I
provide Arg-I
a Arg-I
shelter Arg-I
for Arg-I
various Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitat Arg-I
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the Arg-B
growing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitat Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
ultimate Arg-I
solution Arg-I
of Arg-I
saving Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
wild Arg-B
animals Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
set Arg-I
free Arg-I
from Arg-I
zoos Arg-I

not O
only O
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
also Arg-I
escape Arg-I
from Arg-I
isolation Arg-I
and Arg-I
depression Arg-I
. O

Distance O
- O
learning O
vs. O
attending O

A O
matter O
of O
considerable O
controversy O
at O
present O
is O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
distance O
- O
learning O
should O
be O
promoted O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
or O
rather O
attending O
lectures O
in O
person O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
predominant O
place O
in O
universities O
because O
this O
way O
of O
learning O
is O
superior O
than O
online O
degrees O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
online Arg-B
- Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
widely Arg-I
used Arg-I
among Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
and Arg-I
optimizing Arg-I
cost Arg-I
for Arg-I
educational Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
distance Arg-B
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
brings Arg-I
significant Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
corner Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
earlier Arg-I
times Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
were Arg-I
tired Arg-I
of Arg-I
commuting Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
schools Arg-I
nearby Arg-I
, Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
any Arg-I
differences Arg-I
in Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
's Arg-I
qualifications Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
school Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
. O

Now Arg-B
, Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
for Arg-I
online Arg-I
- Arg-I
courses Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
top Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
the Arg-I

range Arg-I
universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
presence Arg-I
of Arg-I
video Arg-I
conferencing Arg-I
allows Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
educational Arg-B
institutions Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
optimize Arg-I
costs Arg-I
by Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
teacher Arg-I

student Arg-I
ratios Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economical Arg-I
online Arg-I
- Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
, Arg-I
universities Arg-I

colleges Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
offer Arg-I
grants Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
academic Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
but Arg-I
are Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
schools Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
financial Arg-I
constrains Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
opponents O
of O
online O
- O
degrees O
would O
argue O
that O
attending Arg-B
lectures Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
provides Arg-I
students Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
further Arg-I
point Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
approaches Arg-I
involving Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
and Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
among Arg-I
students Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
campus Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
and Arg-I
communications Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
make Arg-I
education Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
distance Arg-B
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
increases Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
discussions O

should O
be O
held O
via O

frequently O
so O
that O
the O

there O
remains O
some O
disagreement O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
overall O
effect O
of O
this O
innovation O
has O
been O
positive O
or O
negative O
. O

Although O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
valid Arg-I
arguments Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
contrary Arg-I
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
the Arg-B
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
globe Arg-I
have Arg-I
benefited Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
and Arg-I
effective Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
tools Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
communication Arg-I
facilitate Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
contact Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
relatives Arg-I
in Arg-I
faraway Arg-I
places Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
global Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
click Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
button Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
vast Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
transmitted Arg-I
from Arg-I
America Arg-I
to Arg-I
China Arg-I
in Arg-I
just Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
seconds Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
generally Arg-I
felt Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
tools Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
is Arg-I
available Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
corner Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
a Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
laptop Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
can Arg-I
talk Arg-I
or Arg-I
send Arg-I
messages Arg-I
online Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
stop Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
corner Arg-I
shop Arg-I
or Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
these Arg-B
new Arg-I
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
do Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
to Arg-I
humankind Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
opponents O
of O
modern O
communications O
claim O
that O
only O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
privileged Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

They O
further O
point O
out O
that O
the Arg-B
wide Arg-I
spread Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
effective Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
costs Arg-I
a Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Anyone Arg-B
who Arg-I
aims Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
these Arg-I
innovations Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
appliances Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
computer Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
cover Arg-I
up Arg-I
costs Arg-I
for Arg-I
communication Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
benefited Arg-I
from Arg-I
modern Arg-I
communication Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
modern Arg-B
communication Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
will Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
increases Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
the O
have O
- O
nots O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
simply O
because O
they O
could O
n't O
afford O
it O
. O

Should O
high O
school O
make O
music O
lessons O
compulsory O
Most O
people O
claim O
that O
in O
high O
school O
music O
must O
be O
taught O
as O
a O
main O
subject O
, O
while O
others O
say O
that O
this O
is O
an O
unnecessary O
subject O
and O
should O
at O
least O
be O
optional O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
I O
will O
give O
my O
opinion O
for O
both O
sides O
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
that Arg-I
music Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
power Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
positively Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
and Arg-I
its Arg-I
psychology Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
many Arg-B
university Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
provide Arg-I
music Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
so O
that O
they Arg-B
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
harmony Arg-I
with Arg-I
music Arg-I
. O

I O
have O
an O
impression O
that O
students Arg-B
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
studying Arg-I
different Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
stress Arg-I
gained Arg-I
during Arg-I
school Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
music Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
useful Arg-I
and Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
solution Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
if Arg-B
musical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
involves Arg-I
many Arg-I
participants Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operation Arg-I
and Arg-I
developed Arg-I
team Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
, Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
students Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
quite Arg-I
poor Arg-I
academic Arg-I
background Arg-I
can Arg-I
show Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
music Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
calm Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
created Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
music Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
mentally Arg-I
enhancing Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

In O
our O
hectic O
life O
, O
however O
, O
demand Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
for Arg-I
musically Arg-I
orientated Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
for Arg-I
academically Arg-I
developed Arg-I
employees Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
majority O
, O
because O
music Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
which Arg-I
requires Arg-I
special Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
towards Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Increasingly O
however O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
supposed Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
, Arg-I
unless Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
more Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
music Arg-B
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
optional Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
thing Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
increased Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

To O
my O
mind O
, O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
by Arg-I
learning Arg-I
occupation Arg-I
- Arg-I
related Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
playing Arg-I
on Arg-I
guitar Arg-I
or Arg-I
singing Arg-I
a Arg-I
song Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
a O
competitive O
worker O
, O
students O
must O
know O
their O
field O
in O
an O
advanced O
level O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
music Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
an Arg-I
individual Arg-I
to Arg-I
shape Arg-I
its Arg-I
character Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
integration Arg-I
of Arg-I
music Arg-I
into Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
bound Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
compulsory Arg-I
. O

Universities O
should O
give O
money O
to O
sport O
activities O
or O
libraries O
Libraries O
and O
sports O
activities O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
universities O
success O
. O

Most O
university O
rankings O
pay O
attention O
to O
quality O
of O
these O
two O
activities O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
universities Arg-B
should Arg-I
invest Arg-I
in Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
else Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
I O
think O
a Arg-B
library Arg-I
is Arg-I
vital Arg-I
and Arg-I
strategical Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
modern Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
library Arg-I
because O
, O
after Arg-B
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
library Arg-I
plays Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

Although O
sport Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
priority Arg-I
of Arg-I
library Arg-I
has Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
only Arg-B
small Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
attend Arg-I
sport Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
my Arg-I
university Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
library Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
students Arg-I
do Arg-I
sports Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
usually Arg-B
libraries Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
libraries Arg-I
are Arg-I
free Arg-I
not Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
also Arg-I
for Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
universities Arg-B
support Arg-I
is Arg-I
vital Arg-I
for Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
. O

But O
sport Arg-B
activities Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
income Arg-I
because O
every Arg-B
sport Arg-I
has Arg-I
different Arg-I
matches Arg-I
and Arg-I
for Arg-I
each Arg-I
match Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
sponsors Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
this Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
sell Arg-I
their Arg-I
important Arg-I
matches Arg-I
tickets Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
ways Arg-I
for Arg-I
sports Arg-I
activities Arg-I
to Arg-I
compensate Arg-I
their Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
hard Arg-I
for Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
investing Arg-B
in Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
result Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
library Arg-I
can Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
books Arg-I
or Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
buy Arg-I
more Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
library Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
are Arg-I
stable Arg-I
and Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
far Arg-I
future Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
most Arg-B
sports Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
except Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
short Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
persistent Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
sports O
activities O
, O
libraries Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
critical Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
university Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
modern Arg-I
library Arg-I
. O

Humans O
should O
be O
able O
to O
use O
animals O
for O
their O
own O
benefit O
? O

Man O
has O
dominated O
all O
his O
fellow O
beings O
on O
earth O
because O
of O
his O
superior O
brain O
. O

He O
has O
domesticated O
a O
large O
number O
of O
animals O
and O
birds O
and O
makes O
use O
of O
them O
to O
make O
life O
easier O
and O
convenient O
for O
himself O
. O

Many O
people O
encourage O
the O
use O
of O
animals O
for O
their O
personal O
needs O
, O
while O
others O
are O
concerned O
that O
animals O
should O
not O
be O
misused O
. O

This O
essay O
will O
discuss O
some O
arguments O
for O
and O
against O
animal O
domestication O
. O

Human Arg-B
being Arg-I
has Arg-I
driven Arg-I
many Arg-I
animals Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
personal Arg-I
use Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
, Arg-I
cows Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
milch Arg-I
animals Arg-I
for Arg-I
yielding Arg-I
milk Arg-I
from Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Likewise Arg-B
, Arg-I
other Arg-I
animals Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
, Arg-I
horses Arg-I
, Arg-I
cattles Arg-I
and Arg-I
donkeys Arg-I
for Arg-I
farming Arg-I
, Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
mode Arg-I
of Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
keep Arg-I
pets Arg-I
like Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
and Arg-I
cats Arg-I
, Arg-I
trained Arg-I
them Arg-I
as Arg-I
service Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
and Arg-I
snuffing Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
to Arg-I
police Arg-I
force Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
blind Arg-I
peoples Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
kept Arg-I
for Arg-I
security Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
in Arg-I
houses Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
many Arg-B
farmers Arg-I
and Arg-I
owners Arg-I
exploit Arg-I
animals Arg-I
beyond Arg-I
their Arg-I
limits Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
cows Arg-B
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
injected Arg-I
by Arg-I
Oxytocin Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
hormone Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
forcibly Arg-I
increase Arg-I
lactation Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
, Arg-I
causes Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
discomfort Arg-I
and Arg-I
pain Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
cattle Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
thousand Arg-B
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
undergo Arg-I
painful Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
or Arg-I
death Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
scientific Arg-I
research Arg-I
of Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
and Arg-I
various Arg-I
products Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
cage Arg-I
farming Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
against Arg-I
animal Arg-I
rights Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
other Arg-I
practices Arg-I
like Arg-I
, Arg-I
equestrian Arg-I
sport Arg-I
where Arg-I
horses Arg-I
run Arg-I
miles Arg-I
and Arg-I
miles Arg-I
and Arg-I
beaten Arg-I
up Arg-I
by Arg-I
jockeys Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
run Arg-I
more Arg-I
faster Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
above Arg-I
all Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
hunting Arg-I
of Arg-I
defenseless Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

From O
my O
prospective O
, O
human Arg-B
being Arg-I
should Arg-I
behave Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
guardian Arg-I
to Arg-I
animals Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
lord Arg-I
or Arg-I
masters Arg-I
. O

Animal Arg-B
rights Arg-I
are Arg-I
meant Arg-I
to Arg-I
set Arg-I
limits Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
and O
manipulation O
of O
them O
should O
be O
punished O
as O
a O
serious O
crime O
. O

Museums O
and O
art O
galleries O
will O
disappear O
soon O
? O

It O
is O
quite O
common O
that O
more O
and O
more O
people O
can O
watch O
exhibitions O
through O
television O
or O
internet O
at O
home O
due O
to O
modern O
technology O
; O
therefore O
, O
some O
people O
think O
museums O
and O
art O
galleries O
will O
disappear O
soon O
. O

Although O
modern O
technology O
make O
it O
possible O
, O
I O
still O
believe O
some Arg-B
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
disappear Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
technology Arg-B
indeed Arg-I
simplifies Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
watch Arg-I
exhibitions Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
internet Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
, Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
road Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
significant Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in Arg-B
accordance Arg-I
with Arg-I
recent Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
experts Arg-I
suggest Arg-I
the Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
of Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
in Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
is Arg-I
unhealthy Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
physical Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
and Arg-I

the Arg-B

is Arg-I
plain Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I

culture Arg-I

First O
of O
all O
, O
authentic Arg-B
exhibits Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
completely Arg-I
displayed Arg-I
only Arg-I
by Arg-I
images Arg-I

videos Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
like Arg-I
travelling Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
viewing Arg-I
the Arg-I
landscape Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I

on Arg-I

, Arg-I
so Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
method Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
one Arg-I
thing Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
experience Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
museums Arg-B

preserve Arg-I
some Arg-I
culture Arg-I

therefore O
, O
these Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
disappear Arg-I
unless Arg-I
people Arg-I
abandon Arg-I
their Arg-I

. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
admit O
that O
modern Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
provided Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
and Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
manner Arg-I
for Arg-I

to Arg-I
watch Arg-I

, O
but O
museums Arg-B
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
for Arg-I
its Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Should O
teenagers O
learn O
all O
school O
subjects O
/ O
focus O
on O
one O
subject O

Presently O
, O
it O
is O
commonly O
accepted O
that O
students O
have O
to O
learn O
over O
eight O
subjects O
in O
school O
. O

Public O
retain O
differing O
views O
on O
whether O
to O
teach O
students O
all O
subjects O
or O
just O
focus O
on O
one O
subject O
. O

Some O
parents O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
full O
class O
schedule O
of O
their O
children O
. O

While O
, O
others O
claim O
that O
studying O
only O
one O
subject O
is O
more O
effective O
. O

Before O
rendering O
my O
own O
opinion O
, O
I O
will O
explore O
sides O
of O
this O
topic O
. O

The Arg-B
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
students Arg-I
different Arg-I
units Arg-I
are Arg-I
easily Arg-I
recognized Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
with Arg-B
some Arg-I
basic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
fields Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
options Arg-I
in Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
areas Arg-I
or Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Teenagers Arg-B
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
too Arg-I
young Arg-I
and Arg-I
immature Arg-I
to Arg-I
decide Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
dedicate Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
combination Arg-I
of Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
and Arg-I
easy Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
balances Arg-I
their Arg-I
schoolwork Arg-I
stress Arg-I
and Arg-I
fosters Arg-I
their Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
on Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
still Arg-B
many Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
variation Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
curriculum Arg-I
, Arg-I
instead Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
with Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
homework Arg-I
and Arg-I
exams Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
done Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
most Arg-B
students Arg-I
regard Arg-I
the Arg-I
extra Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
useless Arg-I
and Arg-I
impractical Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Those O
who O
advocate O
focusing O
on O
one O
subject O
believe O
that O
this Arg-B
education Arg-I
model Arg-I
can Arg-I
cultivate Arg-I
more Arg-I
talents Arg-I
who Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
areas Arg-I
and Arg-I
increase Arg-I
studying Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
probably O
because O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
devote Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
subject Arg-I
and Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the O
drawbacks O
of O
this O
teaching O
method O
can O
not O
be O
neglected O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
under Arg-B
such Arg-I
target Arg-I
- Arg-I
oriented Arg-I
education Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
regret Arg-I
their Arg-I
original Arg-I
choice Arg-I
and Arg-I
change Arg-I
their Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
field Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
further Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
dullness Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
may Arg-I
deeply Arg-I
influence Arg-I
their Arg-I
passion Arg-I
on Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
concentrating Arg-B
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
subject Arg-I
can Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
and Arg-I
foster Arg-I
the Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
in Arg-I
training Arg-I
talents Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
its Arg-I
shortfalls Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
vital Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
support Arg-I
the Arg-I
view Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
all Arg-I
school Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

Influence O
of O
English O
- O
advantages O
outweigh O
the O
disadvantages O

In O
the O
present O
age O
, O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
that O
increasing O
minority O
languages O
have O
diminished O
from O
the O
world O
due O
to O
the O
proliferation O
of O
English O
. O

Some O
people O
claim O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
a Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
loss Arg-I
in Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
while O
others O
argue O
the O
demerits O
exceed O
the O
merits O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
former O
opinion O
. O

No Arg-B
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
deny Arg-I
the Arg-I
huge Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
trend Arg-I
that Arg-I
English Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
accepted Arg-I
universally Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
communication Arg-B
between Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
become Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
English Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
required Arg-I
course Arg-I
from Arg-I
elementary Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
studying Arg-B
abroad Arg-I
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
hot Arg-I
among Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
. O

For O
them O
, O
language Arg-B
obstacle Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
results Arg-I
in Arg-I
mutual Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
and Arg-I
trust Arg-I
between Arg-I
their Arg-I
mother Arg-I
land Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
host Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
enhances Arg-B
relationship Arg-I
and Arg-I
promotes Arg-I
international Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
researchers Arg-B
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
, Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
wider Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
references Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
English Arg-I
. O

Taking Arg-B
IT Arg-I
industry Arg-I
for Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
top Arg-I
technical Arg-I
science Arg-I
is Arg-I
published Arg-I
in Arg-I
English Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
neither Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
translated Arg-I
version Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
articles Arg-I
, Arg-I
nor Arg-I
to Arg-I
always Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
translator Arg-I
besides Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
choice Arg-I
but Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
English Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
second Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
opponents O
may O
blame O
that O
English Arg-B
is Arg-I
making Arg-I
lesser Arg-I
- Arg-I
known Arg-I
languages Arg-I
disappear Arg-I
ever Arg-I
year Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
the Arg-B
culture Arg-I
heritage Arg-I
and Arg-I
nation Arg-I
identity Arg-I
vanish Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
short Arg-I
- Arg-I
sighted Arg-I
, Arg-I
ignoring Arg-I
the Arg-I
rapid Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
native Arg-I
economy Arg-I
and Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
some O
negative O
effects O
, O
I Arg-B
'm Arg-I
totally Arg-I
convinced Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
prevalent Arg-I
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
English Arg-I
brings Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
countries Arg-I
all Arg-I
around Arg-I
. O

I O
suggest O
all O
youths O
should O
learn O
English O
owing O
to O
its O
key O
role O
in O
globalization O
. O

But O
at O
the O

time O
, O
actions O
, O
like O

, O
can O
be O
taken O
to O
protect O
native O

Creativity O

Creativity O

the O
ability O

think O
beyond O
the O
obvious O
. O

Many O
governments O
restrict O
the O

of O
the O

. O

Creativity Arg-B
originates Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
free Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
creative Arg-B
artists Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
their Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I

. O

Time Arg-B
and Arg-I
again Arg-I
, Arg-I
creative Arg-I
artists Arg-I
like Arg-I
Michaelangelo Arg-I
, Arg-I
Picasso Arg-I
, Arg-I
Salman Arg-I
Rushdie Arg-I
, Arg-I
Shakespeare Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. Arg-I
have Arg-I
made Arg-I
artistic Arg-I
works Arg-I
which Arg-I
gave Arg-I
a Arg-I
social Arg-I
message Arg-I
. O

Right Arg-B
from Arg-I
sculptures Arg-I
to Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
, Arg-I
books Arg-I
to Arg-I
drama Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
these Arg-I
artistic Arg-I
works Arg-I
have Arg-I
reflected Arg-I
the Arg-I
contemporary Arg-I
social Arg-I
issues Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
eras Arg-I
. O

Creative Arg-B
works Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
social Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
by Arg-I
giving Arg-I
a Arg-I
social Arg-I
message Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
innovative Arg-B
works Arg-I
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
realize Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
way Arg-I
and Arg-I
peep Arg-I
into Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
conscience Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
raise Arg-I
issues Arg-I
and Arg-I
criticize Arg-I
the Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
doings Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
governments Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Bangladeshi Arg-B
writer Arg-I
Taslima Arg-I
Nasrin Arg-I
was Arg-I
accused Arg-I
of Arg-I
acting Arg-I
against Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, Arg-I
just Arg-I
because Arg-I
she Arg-I
raised Arg-I
a Arg-I
social Arg-I
issue Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
approach Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
hurdle Arg-I
in Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
creative Arg-I
minds Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
creativity Arg-B
also Arg-I
gives Arg-I
aesthetic Arg-I
charm Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
governments O
restrict O
the O
artists O
. O

Frank Arg-B
Zappa Arg-I
once Arg-I
said Arg-I
, Arg-I
" Arg-I
Mind Arg-I
is Arg-I

if Arg-I
its Arg-I
not Arg-I
open Arg-I
“ Arg-I
. O

Restrictions Arg-B
would Arg-I
just Arg-I
curb Arg-I
the Arg-I
innovative Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
artists Arg-I
and Arg-I
would Arg-I
limit Arg-I
their Arg-I
brains Arg-I
. O

Like Arg-B
the Arg-I
media Arg-I
, Arg-I
artists Arg-I
should Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
their Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
freely Arg-I

However O
, O
artists Arg-B
should Arg-I
also Arg-I
know Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
the Arg-I
sentiments Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
artists Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
controversies Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
hurting Arg-I
the Arg-I
religious Arg-I
or Arg-I
social Arg-I
beliefs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
common Arg-I
people Arg-I

Artists Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
self Arg-I

awareness Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
vulgar Arg-I
, Arg-I
hurtful Arg-I

useless Arg-I
works Arg-I
which Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
serve Arg-I
any Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
artists Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
of Arg-I
expression Arg-I
. O

Mind Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
work Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
chained Arg-I
in Arg-I
boundaries Arg-I
. O

Imagination Arg-B
is Arg-I
at Arg-I
its Arg-I
best Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I

is Arg-I
relaxed Arg-I
and Arg-I
free Arg-I
from Arg-I

A Arg-B

everything Arg-I
by Arg-I

For O
instance O
, O
lions Arg-B
hunt Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
due Arg-I

higher Arg-I

identify Arg-I

strengths Arg-I

as Arg-I

A Arg-B

Unfortunately O

the O
meaning O
of O

been O
modified O
in O
a O

An Arg-B

kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
competition Arg-I
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
fruitful Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
. O

Competition Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
always Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
rule Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
healthy Arg-I
competition Arg-I
which Arg-I
involves Arg-I
raising Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
own Arg-I
level Arg-I
above Arg-I
others Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
approach Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
competition O
and O
co O
- O
operation O
go O
hand O
in O
hand O
. O

These O
are O
two O
sides O
of O
the O
same O
coin O
which O
ca O
n't O
be O
separated O
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
taught Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operation Arg-I
complimented Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
competition Arg-I
. O

They O
must O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
the O
demerits O
of O
selfish O
competition O
. O

When O
co O
- O
operation O
and O
healthy O
competition O
is O
followed O
together O
, O
success O
, O
achievements O
, O
recognition O
and O
any O
goal O
becomes O
easier O
. O

Capital O
punishment O

necessary O
or O
not O
Crime O
is O
always O
punishable O
. O

Retribution O
is O
the O
method O
for O
countering O
criminals O
. O

Some O
countries O
have O
stringent O
rules O
, O
like O
capital O
punishment O
, O
while O
other O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
flexibility O
in O
the O
judicial O
system O
. O

However O
, O
strict Arg-B
laws Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
given Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
" Arg-I
rarest Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
rare Arg-I
" Arg-I
cases Arg-I
. O

Its Arg-B
first Arg-I
and Arg-I
foremost Arg-I
objective Arg-I
is Arg-I
safety Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
a Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
commit Arg-I
heinous Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
protects Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
from Arg-I
hardcore Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
curbs Arg-I
the Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
and Arg-I
prospects Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
hateful Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
mind Arg-I
knows Arg-I
the Arg-I
quantum Arg-I
of Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
fear Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
commit Arg-I
such Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
and Arg-I
violence Arg-I
is Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
decreased Arg-I
. O

Importantly O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
saves Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
government Arg-I
funding Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
in Arg-I
maintenance Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
hardcore Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
. O

Criminals Arg-B
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
any Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
or Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
past Arg-I
record Arg-I
of Arg-I
such Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
are Arg-I
, Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
given Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
jury Arg-I
giving Arg-I
the Arg-I
verdict Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
humans Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
discretion Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
affect Arg-I
an Arg-I
innocent Arg-I
, Arg-I
circumstantially Arg-I
marred Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
jury Arg-I
must Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
take Arg-I
into Arg-I
account Arg-I
the Arg-I
circumstances Arg-I
of Arg-I
committing Arg-I
a Arg-I
crime Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
an Arg-I
individual Arg-I
murders Arg-I
someone Arg-I
for Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
defense Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
crime Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
heinous Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
deserving Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
commit Arg-I
such Arg-I
hateful Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
proper Arg-I
senses Arg-I
are Arg-I
subjected Arg-I
to Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
. O

Capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
psychopaths Arg-B
, Arg-I
terrorists Arg-I
or Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
who Arg-I
lacks Arg-I
empathy Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
human Arg-I
lives Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
. O

Capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
safeguard Arg-I
human Arg-I
rights Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
strict Arg-I
and Arg-I
effective Arg-I
manner Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
the O
last O
option O
by O
the O
jury O
and O
all O
circumstances O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
before O
pronouncing O
the O
final O
verdict O
. O

Is O
a O
break O
good O
or O
bad O
after O
high O
school O
for O
students O

Studies O
are O
an O
essential O
part O
of O
life O
. O

Some O
countries O
permit O
students O
to O
take O
a O
break O
from O
studies O
between O
high O
school O
and O
university O
studies O
, O
while O
in O
some O
countries O
, O
it O
is O
considered O
as O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

However O
, O
a Arg-B
break Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
year Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
after Arg-I
finishing Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

In O
most O
education O
systems O
, O
a O
child O
studies O
continuously O
from O
the O
age O
of O
5 O
till O
16 O
years O
of O
age O
. O

A Arg-B
relaxation Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
year Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
minds Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
a Arg-I
quintessential Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
continuous Arg-I
study Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
for Arg-I
over Arg-I
10 Arg-I
years Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
mind Arg-I
saturated Arg-I
and Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
robot Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
follow Arg-I
instructions Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
a Arg-B
break Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
students Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
refresh Arg-I
their Arg-I
systems Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
or Arg-I
following Arg-I
their Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
. O

Importantly O
, O
when Arg-B
students Arg-I
start Arg-I
their Arg-I
university Arg-I
studies Arg-I
after Arg-I
a Arg-I
break Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
and Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
during O
high O
school O
, O
many O
students O
face O
a O
dilemma O
to O
decide O
which O
stream O
should O
they O
major O
in O
. O

Working Arg-B
or Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
for Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
their Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
interest Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
professional Arg-I
setup Arg-I
by Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

Financially Arg-B
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
a Arg-I
little Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
their Arg-I
university Arg-I
education Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
students Arg-I
even Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
this Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
desired Arg-I
university Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
also O
disadvantages O
. O

A Arg-B
break Arg-I
can Arg-I
disturb Arg-I
the Arg-I
focus Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
prove Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
students Arg-I
work Arg-I
during Arg-I
these Arg-I
breaks Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
feel Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
gives Arg-I
them Arg-I
an Arg-I
illusion Arg-I
that Arg-I
such Arg-I
salary Arg-I
is Arg-I
enough Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
go Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
utopia Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my Arg-B
cousin Arg-I
started Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
customer Arg-I
care Arg-I
centre Arg-I
after Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
got Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
he Arg-I
started Arg-I
his Arg-I
university Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
failed Arg-I
miserably Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
indulge Arg-I
in Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
or Arg-I
drinking Arg-I
during Arg-I
this Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

But O
, O
the O
break O
should O
be O
an O
optional O
thing O
. O

It Arg-B
varies Arg-I
from Arg-I
individual Arg-I
to Arg-I
individual Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
that Arg-I
period Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
break Arg-I
gives Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
harms Arg-I
. O

Importantly O
, O
the Arg-B
sole Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
a Arg-I
young Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
thrust Arg-I
studies Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
a Arg-B
break Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
necessarily Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
minds Arg-I
between Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

Countries O
, O
like O
India O
, O
where O
such O
a O
break O
is O
considered O
a O
blot O
, O
should O
understand O
that O
young O
minds O
are O
delicate O
and O
they O
face O
a O
cut O
- O
throat O
competition O
. O

One O
year O
break O
can O
help O
young O
people O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
challenges O
of O
life O
. O

Should O
universities O
accept O
equal O
number O
of O
males O
/ O
females O
or O
not O
Education O
is O
important O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Its O
a O
debatable O
issue O
whether O
universities O
should O
accept O
equal O
number O
of O
males O
and O
females O
in O
a O
course O
or O
not O
. O

However O
, O
since O
both O
genders O
are O
equally O
important O
, O
both O
must O
be O
given O
equal O
opportunities O
. O

Universities Arg-B
must Arg-I
admit Arg-I
both Arg-I
in Arg-I
equal Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
, Arg-I
depending Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
choices Arg-I
. O

Right Arg-B
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
basic Arg-I
human Arg-I
right Arg-I
of Arg-I
both Arg-I
, Arg-I
males Arg-I
and Arg-I
females Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
whole Arg-I
world Arg-I
aims Arg-I
for Arg-I
women Arg-I
empowerment Arg-I
, O
and O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
females Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
equal Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
as Arg-I
males Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
universities Arg-I
will Arg-I
accept Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
equal Arg-I
number Arg-I
, Arg-I
both Arg-I
genders Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
their Arg-I
talent Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
environment Arg-I
will Arg-I
develop Arg-I
. O

Co Arg-B
- Arg-I
education Arg-I
helps Arg-I
both Arg-I
genders Arg-I
to Arg-I
gel Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
helps Arg-I
them Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
behave Arg-I
and Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
boy Arg-I
's Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
generally Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
female Arg-I
or Arg-I
behave Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
females Arg-B
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
girl Arg-I
's Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
are Arg-I
too Arg-I
shy Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
boys Arg-I
. O

Co Arg-B
- Arg-I
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
eradicate Arg-I
this Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
demerit Arg-I
in Arg-I
both Arg-I
. O

Universities Arg-B
giving Arg-I
both Arg-I
genders Arg-I
equal Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
future Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
some Arg-B
male Arg-I
chauvinists Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
women Arg-I
are Arg-I
incapable Arg-I
in Arg-I
particular Arg-I
fields Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
maths Arg-I
, Arg-I
mechanical Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
, Arg-I
defense Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
gender Arg-I
biased Arg-I
approach Arg-I
is Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Time O
and O
again O
, O
women Arg-B
have Arg-I
proved Arg-I
their Arg-I
mettle Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Women Arg-B
like Arg-I
Margaret Arg-I
Thatcher Arg-I
, Arg-I
Indira Arg-I
Gandhi Arg-I
, Arg-I
Mari Arg-I
Curie Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
symbols Arg-I
of Arg-I
women Arg-I
's Arg-I
intelligence Arg-I
and Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
both Arg-B
genders Arg-I
have Arg-I
equal Arg-I
rights Arg-I
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
should Arg-I
accept Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
equal Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
. O

Equality Arg-B
in Arg-I
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
in Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Both Arg-B
genders Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
fulcrum Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
and Arg-I
none Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
is Arg-I
superior Arg-I
or Arg-I
inferior Arg-I
. O

Choice O
of O
course O
should O
be O
the O
discretion O
of O
the O
student O
and O
their O
merit O
, O
irrespective O
of O
the O
gender O
. O

Educational O
rights O
must O
be O
given O
to O
both O
genders O
. O

People O
will O
spend O
less O
time O
on O
cooking O
food O

Perhaps O
, O
no O
issue O
in O
this O
world O
is O
as O
significant O
to O
people O
as O
cooking O
food O
, O
because O
it O
affects O
everybody O
in O
their O
daily O
lives O
. O

Some O
people O
hold O
the O
opinion O
that O
people O
should O
spend O
much O
time O
on O
food O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
think O
that O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
food Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
various O
reasons O
why O
I O
maintain O
this O
viewpoint O
, O
and O
among O
those O
reasons O
are O
two O
important O
ones O
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
is O
that O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
science Arg-I
and Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
kitchen Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
microwaves Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
cookers Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
created Arg-I
and Arg-I
invented Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
and Arg-I
cook Arg-I
food Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
just Arg-I
spend Arg-I
one Arg-I
hour Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
meal Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
two Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
three Arg-I
hours Arg-I
like Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
last Arg-I
10 Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Actually O
, O
in Arg-B
recent Arg-I
years Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
walks Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
realizing Arg-I
this Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
in Arg-I
doing Arg-I
their Arg-I
housework Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
this Arg-I
figure Arg-I
still Arg-I
continuously Arg-I
go Arg-I
up Arg-I
along Arg-I

the Arg-I

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
certain Arg-I
that Arg-I
spending Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
trend Arg-I
in Arg-I
near Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
meals Arg-I
at Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
study Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

According O
to O
a O
recent O
survey O
, O
89 Arg-B
% Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
come Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
since Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
put Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
filled Arg-I
with Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
and Arg-I
pressures Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
update Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
all Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
they Arg-B
find Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
and Arg-I
cook Arg-I
a Arg-I
meal Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
out Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
and Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
the Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
from Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
investing Arg-B
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
food Arg-I
will Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
nutrition Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
food Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
it O
is O
true O
. O

However O
, O
as Arg-B
a Arg-I
matter Arg-I
of Arg-I
fact Arg-I
, Arg-I
using Arg-I
technology Arg-I
or Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
make Arg-I
food Arg-I
lose Arg-I
its Arg-I
nutrition Arg-I
and Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
ozone Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
bacterias Arg-I
, Arg-I
mold Arg-I
spores Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
pesticide Arg-I
in Arg-I
vegetables Arg-I
, Arg-I
fruits Arg-I
and Arg-I
foods Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
killed Arg-I
and Arg-I
removed Arg-I
, O
thus O
health Arg-B
and Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
eaters Arg-I
is Arg-I
assured Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
along Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
living Arg-I
standard Arg-I
, Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
of Arg-I
quality Arg-I
products Arg-I
in Arg-I
almost Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
, Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
under Arg-I
severe Arg-I
control Arg-I
and Arg-I
supervision Arg-I
by Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
quite Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
nutritious Arg-I
meal Arg-I
with Arg-I
guaranteed Arg-I
quality Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
waste Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
if O
all O
those O
factors O
are O
contemplated O
, O
it O
is O
obviously O
found O
that O
there O
are O
many O
solid O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
viewpoint O
. O

So O
, O
from O
what O
have O
been O
discussed O
above O
, O
I O
strongly O
affirm O
the O
conclusion O
that O
people Arg-B
will Arg-I
spend Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
food Arg-I
. O

Traditional O
games O
or O
modern O
games O
in O
developing O
children O
's O
skills O
Games O
have O
played O
a O
key O
role O
in O
children O
's O
growth O
, O
especially O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
abilities O
. O

With O
technological O
advances O
, O
children O
have O
more O
access O
to O
modern O
games O
currently O
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
traditional O
games O
and O
modern O
games O
in O
children O
's O
developments O
of O
skills O
has O
become O
a O
frequent O
topic O
of O
discussion O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
believe O
parents Arg-B
and Arg-I
educators Arg-I
should Arg-I
attach Arg-I
more Arg-I
importance Arg-I
to Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
modern Arg-B
games Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
extent Arg-I
, Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
foster Arg-I
some Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
computer Arg-I
skills Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
latest Arg-I
trend Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
children Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
proficient Arg-I
at Arg-I
computers Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
join Arg-I
online Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
fact Arg-I
, Arg-I
helps Arg-I
children Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
a Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
skill Arg-I
at Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
children Arg-B
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
experience Arg-I
the Arg-I
state Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
the Arg-I
- Arg-I
art Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
raising Arg-I
their Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
innovation Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
stay Arg-I
conservative Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
traditional Arg-B
games Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
indispensible Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
than Arg-I
modern Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
primary Arg-I
merit Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
foster Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
communication Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
most Arg-I
modern Arg-I
games Arg-I
which Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
between Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
provide Arg-I
a Arg-I
relaxing Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
where Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
chat Arg-I
, Arg-I
laugh Arg-I
and Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
communicating Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
issue Arg-I
for Arg-I
these Arg-I
children Arg-I
any Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
educational Arg-I
functions Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
hold Arg-I
that Arg-I
keep Arg-I
them Arg-I
alive Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
these Arg-B
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
were Arg-I
elaborately Arg-I
devised Arg-I
by Arg-I
educators Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
proven Arg-I
effective Arg-I
in Arg-I
improving Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
skills Arg-I
on Arg-I
different Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
in Arg-I
previous Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
practices Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
modern Arg-B
games Arg-I
are Arg-I
developed Arg-I
by Arg-I
game Arg-I
companies Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
profits Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
risk Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
unhealthy Arg-I
contents Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
violence Arg-I
or Arg-I
pornography Arg-I
, Arg-I
arranged Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
games Arg-I
by Arg-I
such Arg-I
companies Arg-I
to Arg-I
secure Arg-I
financial Arg-I
survival Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
traditional Arg-B
games Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
no Arg-I
means Arg-I
, Arg-I
ignored Arg-I
by Arg-I
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
advent Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
through Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
games Arg-I
can Arg-I
children Arg-I
be Arg-I
ensured Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
and Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
skills Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

Government O
should O
n't O
put O
money O
on O
building O
theaters O
or O
sports O
stadiums O
How O
to O
allocate O
governmental O
budget O
efficiently O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hot O
topic O
of O
discussion O
among O
the O
public O
. O

Recently O
, O
some O
people O
argue O
that O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
invest Arg-I
more Arg-I
on Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
on Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
or Arg-I
sports Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
this O
proposal O
is O
beneficial O
more O
to O
the O
society O
. O

Taking Arg-B
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
who Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
disease Arg-I
or Arg-I
illiteracy Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
urgent Arg-I
and Arg-I
pragmatic Arg-I
than Arg-I
building Arg-I
theaters Arg-I
or Arg-I
sports Arg-I
stadiums Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
an Arg-B
uneducated Arg-I
person Arg-I
may Arg-I
barely Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
musicals Arg-I
, Arg-I
whereas Arg-I
a Arg-I
physical Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
person Arg-I
, Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
medical Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
, Arg-I
may Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
sports Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
providing Arg-B
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
and Arg-I
prioritized Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Entertaining Arg-B
facilities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
cinemas Arg-I
, Arg-I
theaters Arg-I
and Arg-I
sports Arg-I
stadiums Arg-I
are Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
profit Arg-I
- Arg-I
oriented Arg-I
. O

Their Arg-B
existences Arg-I
are Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
marketing Arg-I
strategies Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
condition Arg-I
of Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
volume Arg-I
of Arg-I
audience Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
competition Arg-I
among Arg-I
each Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
free Arg-I
market Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
interfered Arg-I
by Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
the Arg-B
establishment Arg-I
of Arg-I
medical Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
or Arg-I
educational Arg-I
institutes Arg-I
is Arg-I
aimed Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
or Arg-I
education Arg-I
standard Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
earning Arg-I
profits Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
deserves Arg-I
more Arg-I
funds Arg-I
from Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
putting Arg-B
taxpayers Arg-I
' Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
building Arg-I
theaters Arg-I
or Arg-I
sports Arg-I
stadiums Arg-I
is Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
to Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
use Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
not Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
fan Arg-I
of Arg-I
watching Arg-I
musicals Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
spot Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
bit Arg-I
inappropriate Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
' Arg-I
tax Arg-I
funds Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
a Arg-I
minority Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
sectors Arg-B
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
more Arg-I
governmental Arg-I
support Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
accessed Arg-I
by Arg-I
every Arg-I
individual Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
daily Arg-I
basis Arg-I
. O

To O
summarize O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
budgets Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
allocated Arg-I
more Arg-I
on Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
on Arg-I
building Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, O
because O
the Arg-B
former Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
, Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
profit Arg-I
oriented Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
accessed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

Technology O
keeps O
traditional O
skills O
and O
ways O
of O
life O
alive O
or O
not O
? O

Living O
in O
the O
21st O
century O
, O
people O
are O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
technology O
is O
the O
main O
driving O
force O
behind O
productivity O
. O

Thus O
, O
every O
country O
has O
been O
promoting O
technological O
advances O
in O
the O
recent O
years O
, O
regardless O
of O
any O
potential O
problems O
it O
may O
bring O
about O
. O

Some O
people O
are O
worried O
modern O
technological O
technology O
is O
probably O
a O
hurdle O
to O
the O
preservation O
of O
traditional O
techniques O
and O
lifestyles O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
their O
concern O
is O
groundless O
. O

Instead O
, O
technology Arg-B
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
key Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
and Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
space Arg-I
, Arg-I
technology Arg-I
makes Arg-I
it Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
effective Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
only Arg-I
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
place Arg-I
could Arg-I
they Arg-I
experience Arg-I
the Arg-I
specific Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
means Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
who Arg-I
were Arg-I
engaged Arg-I
in Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
or Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
by Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
miss Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
innovations Arg-I
in Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
humankind Arg-I
can Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
displayed Arg-I
online Arg-I
anytime Arg-I
, Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
technology Arg-B
enriches Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
displaying Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
heritage Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
it Arg-I
more Arg-I
vivid Arg-I
and Arg-I
appealing Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
China Arg-B
has Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
Shanghai Arg-I
World Arg-I
Expo Arg-I
, Arg-I
using Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
state Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
the Arg-I
- Arg-I
art Arg-I
technological Arg-I
methods Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
robots Arg-I
and Arg-I
LED Arg-I
screens Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many Arg-B
tourists Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
marveled Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
perfect Arg-I
synthesis Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
concerned Arg-I
that Arg-I
technology Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
. O

They O
argue O
that O
people O
, O
especially Arg-B
youngsters Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
crazier Arg-I
about Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
and Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
things Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
digital Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
indifferent Arg-I
to Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
. O

But O
I O
believe O
this O
is O
not O
the O
issue O
because O
people Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
trend Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
recent Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
will O
conclude O

Creative O
Artists O
Innovative O
artists O
bring O
enjoyment O

inspiration O
to O
our O
sometimes O
tedious O
life O

however O
, O
some O
people O
deem O
that O

been O
entrusted O
with O
too O
much O
freedom O
and O
power O
and O
should O
be O
restricted O
by O
the O

It O
is O
my O
personal O
belief O
that O
freedom Arg-B
of Arg-I
expressing Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
and Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
should Arg-I
always Arg-I
be Arg-I
eulogized Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
rather Arg-I
iniquitous Arg-I
to Arg-I
impose Arg-I
a Arg-I
shackle Arg-I
on Arg-I
artists Arg-I
' Arg-I
will Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
major Arg-I
concerns Arg-I
against Arg-I
freeing Arg-I
artists Arg-I
' Arg-I
creation Arg-I
derives Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
fear Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
which Arg-I
would Arg-I
destabilize Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
I O
believe O
the Arg-B
audiences Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
judgement Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
misled Arg-I
or Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
by Arg-I
some Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
needless O
to O
say O
that O
art Arg-B
inevitably Arg-I
involves Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
, Arg-I
exaggeration Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
is Arg-I
purely Arg-I
fabricated Arg-I
; Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
whether Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
is Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
truth Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
's Arg-I
authority Arg-I
to Arg-I
determine Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
interpret Arg-I
its Arg-I
meaning Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
displays Arg-I
unreality Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
audiences Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
acumen Arg-I
to Arg-I
recognise Arg-I
its Arg-I
untruthfulness Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
its Arg-I
art Arg-I
value Arg-I
; O
if O
the O
art O
reflects O
the O
reality O
, O
then O
what O
would O
be O
the O
intention O
to O
ban O
it O
if O
it O
was O
not O
for O
covering O
the O
dirty O
truth O
? O

Would O
it O
be O
autocratic O
if O
the O
government O
clamp O
down O
the O
artists O
who O
are O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O

In O
a O
word O
, O
the Arg-B
notion Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
afraid Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
is Arg-I
unjustified Arg-I
. O

Let O
's O
then O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
impact O
that O
art O
has O
posed O
on O
individuals O
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
some Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
may Arg-I
contain Arg-I
negative Arg-I
implications Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
insanity Arg-I
, Arg-I
violence Arg-I
, Arg-I
eroticism Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

I O
absolutely O
agree O
that O
restrictions Arg-B
on Arg-I
exposure Arg-I
to Arg-I
adolescents Arg-I
should Arg-I
apply Arg-I
as O
adolescents Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
mature Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
being Arg-I
led Arg-I
astray Arg-I
by Arg-I
these Arg-I
contents Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
case Arg-I
of Arg-I
adults Arg-I
being Arg-I
the Arg-I
audience Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
's Arg-I
really Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
to Arg-I
hide Arg-I
– Arg-I

these Arg-I
negative Arg-I
things Arg-I
objectively Arg-I
exist Arg-I
on Arg-I
this Arg-I
planet Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
for Arg-I
adults Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
brain Arg-I
- Arg-I
washed Arg-I
only Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
pieces Arg-I
of Arg-I
creative Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
I O
do O
not O
root O
for O
the O
idea O
that O
restrictions O
should O
be O
put O
on O
artists O
work O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
their Arg-I
innovative Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
– O
this Arg-B
world Arg-I
needs Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
itself Arg-I
colourful Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
there O
are O
more O
opportunities O
for O
women O
than O
there O
were O
in O
the O
past O

The O
modern O
times O
have O
witnessed O
profound O
changes O
in O
most O
aspects O
of O
life O
, O
including O
the O
revolution O
of O
feminism O
. O

Women O
have O
been O
opened O
up O
to O
more O
chances O
than O
ever O
. O

This Arg-B
, Arg-I
contrary Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
human Arg-I
society Arg-I
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
the Arg-B
fairness Arg-I
between Arg-I
males Arg-I
and Arg-I
females Arg-I
is Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
developed Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Gone Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
days Arg-I
when Arg-I
women Arg-I
could Arg-I
do Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
stick Arg-I
to Arg-I
boring Arg-I
house Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Women Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
are Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
active Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
businessmen Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
join Arg-I
the Arg-I
political Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the Arg-B
" Arg-I
weaker Arg-I
" Arg-I
gender Arg-I
as Arg-I
often Arg-I
be Arg-I
thought Arg-I
has Arg-I
enough Arg-I
right Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
just Arg-I
like Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
men Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
mention Arg-I
they Arg-I
even Arg-I
perform Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
second O
place O
, O
the Arg-B
revolution Arg-I
in Arg-I
females Arg-I
' Arg-I
right Arg-I
has Arg-I
brought Arg-I
about Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
to Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
but Arg-I
society Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
financial Arg-I
burden Arg-I
of Arg-I
families Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
has Arg-I
decreased Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
with Arg-I
both Arg-I
the Arg-I
wives Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
husbands Arg-I
working Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
women Arg-B
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
instinct Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
up Arg-I
some Arg-I
careers Arg-I
like Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
or Arg-I
human Arg-I
resource Arg-I
management Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
patience Arg-I
and Arg-I
elaboration Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
such Arg-B
changes Arg-I
do Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
results Arg-I
like Arg-I
an Arg-I
upward Arg-I
trend Arg-I
in Arg-I
divorce Arg-I
rate Arg-I
or O
, O
under O
many O
circumstances O
, O
women Arg-B
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
balance Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
role Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
wives Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
children Arg-B
might Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
less Arg-I
care Arg-I
from Arg-I
parents Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
both Arg-I
busy Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Yet O
everything O
has O
it O
upside O
and O
downside O
, O
women O
should O
find O
the O
best O
way O
to O
overcome O
such O
challenges O
. O

All O
things O
considered O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
where Arg-I
females Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
equal Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
males Arg-I
would Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
far Arg-I
outweighing Arg-I
its Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
. O

Growing O
traffic O
and O
pollution O
can O
be O
controlled O
by O
increasing O
petrol O
prices O
As O
we O
read O
newspapers O
or O
watch O
TV O
, O
we O
have O
always O
been O
attracted O
by O
environmental O
problems O
such O
as O
traffic O
issues O
, O
air O
and O
water O
pollution O
questions O
. O

Initiatives O
should O
be O
taken O
to O
address O
the O
specific O
problems O
. O

As O
the O
impacts O
for O
those O
pollution O
and O
traffic O
issues O
are O
extremely O
far O
- O
reaching O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
insufficient Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
petrol Arg-I
price Arg-I
only Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, O
though O
it O
is O
a O
promising O
method O
discussed O
in O
the O
contemporary O
society O
. O

Specifically O
, O
price Arg-B
control Arg-I
institution Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
areas Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
farming Arg-I
products Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
estate Arg-I
area Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
whether Arg-B
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
out Arg-I
for Arg-I
alleviating Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
and Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
ought Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
evaluated Arg-I
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
governments Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
macro Arg-I
- Arg-I
economic Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
price Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
areas Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
social Arg-I
demands Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
it Arg-B
seems Arg-I
not Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
petrol Arg-I
price Arg-I
instantly Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
pollutions Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
burning Arg-I
of Arg-I
oil Arg-I
, Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
pollutants Arg-I
, Arg-I
extra Arg-I
lights Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
constitute Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
improvements Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
also Arg-I
attribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
speed Arg-I
- Arg-I
up Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
pace Arg-I
, Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
in Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jams Arg-I
during Arg-I
rush Arg-I
- Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

As O
illustrated O
before O
, O
several Arg-B
other Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
to Arg-I
assist Arg-I
in Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Primarily O
, O
authorities Arg-B
should Arg-I
spare Arg-I
no Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
in Arg-I
improving Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
constructing Arg-I
more Arg-I
bus Arg-I
lines Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
the Arg-I
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
temporarily Arg-B
targets Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
set Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
regard Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
limitations Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollutants Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
season Arg-I
. O

Plus O
with Arg-B
supervisory Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
built Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
and Arg-I
address Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
cultivating Arg-B
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
protection Arg-I
would Arg-I
also Arg-I
work Arg-I
out Arg-I
, Arg-I
though Arg-I
it Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
into Arg-I
effect Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
wise Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
addressing Arg-B
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
issues Arg-I
only Arg-I
by Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
oil Arg-I
price Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
, O
while O
improving O
transportation O
facilities O
and O
building O
supervisory O
institution O
would O
be O
preferable O
, O
plus O
with O
the O
awareness O
of O
environmental O
protection O
being O
raised O
. O

Is O
image O
more O
powerful O
than O
the O
written O
word O
? O

" O
A O
picture O
is O
worth O
a O
thousand O
words O
" O
is O
a O
popular O
maxim O
that O
is O
being O
used O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

This O
strongly O
depicts O
the O
power O
of O
images O
in O
conveying O
messages O
, O
ideas O
, O
or O
opinions O
to O
people O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
importance O
of O
written O
word O
can O
never O
be O
denied O
as O
it O
is O
also O
another O
way O
of O
communication O
that O
is O
commonly O
used O
. O

Hence O
, O
I Arg-B
agree Arg-I
only Arg-I
to Arg-I
certain Arg-I
degree Arg-I
that Arg-I
in Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
image Arg-I
serves Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
pictures Arg-B
can Arg-I
influence Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
people Arg-I
think Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
horrendous Arg-I
images Arg-I
are Arg-I
displayed Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
cigarette Arg-I
boxes Arg-I
to Arg-I
illustrate Arg-I
the Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
of Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
statistics Arg-B
show Arg-I
a Arg-I
slight Arg-I
reduction Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
, Arg-I
indicating Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
realize Arg-I
the Arg-I
effects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
negative Arg-I
habit Arg-I
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
magnificent Arg-I
photograph Arg-I
captured Arg-I
by Arg-I
Kevin Arg-I
Carter Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
portrayed Arg-I
a Arg-I
starving Arg-I
Sudanese Arg-I
child Arg-I
struck Arg-I
by Arg-I
extreme Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
has Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
highlighted Arg-I
the Arg-I
plight Arg-I
faced Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
in Arg-I
Sudan Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
images Arg-B
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
widely Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
, Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
and Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
that Arg-I
images Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
absence Arg-I
of Arg-I
words Arg-I
can Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
claim Arg-I
the Arg-I
attraction Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
written Arg-B
words Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
vital Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
spread Arg-I
across Arg-I
certain Arg-I
messages Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
only Arg-I
pictures Arg-I
, Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
is Arg-I
left Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
interpretation Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
perceive Arg-I
the Arg-I
images Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
different Arg-I
when Arg-I
words Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
explain Arg-I
what Arg-I
the Arg-I
illustration Arg-I
is Arg-I
about Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
primary Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
educating Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
by Arg-I
this Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Academic Arg-B
textbooks Arg-I
these Arg-I
days Arg-I
are Arg-I
laden Arg-I
with Arg-I
words Arg-I
besides Arg-I
pictures Arg-I
to Arg-I
guide Arg-I
the Arg-I
readers Arg-I
to Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
both Arg-B
images Arg-I
and Arg-I
words Arg-I
go Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
hand Arg-I
and Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
wholly Arg-I
emphasise Arg-I
on Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
, Arg-I
either Arg-I
images Arg-I
or Arg-I
words Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
for O
a O
more O
meaningful O
communication O
, O
these O
two O
elements O
have O
their O
respective O
roles O
to O
play O
: O
image O
to O
exemplify O
and O
words O
to O
describe O
a O
particular O
subject O
. O

Several O
languages O
are O
in O
danger O
of O
extinction O

It O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
some O
languages O
are O
disappearing O
day O
by O
day O
over O
the O
world O
. O

Some O
people O
, O
therefore O
, O
harbour O
a O
view O
saying O
that O
governments O
should O
preserve O
those O
by O
spending O
some O
budgets O
on O
them O
. O

But O
the O
others O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
possible O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
viewpoint O
needs O
to O
be O
examined O
thoroughly O
and O
this O
essay O
will O
discuss O
this O
issue O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
languages Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
oral Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
quite Arg-I
major Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
helps Arg-I
people Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
between Arg-I
nations Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
regions Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
clearance Arg-I
of Arg-I
minority Arg-I
of Arg-I
language Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
national Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
, Arg-I
customs Arg-I
and Arg-I
habitants Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
exist Arg-I
. O

Governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
and Arg-I
preserving Arg-I
these Arg-I
things Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
rich Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
of Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
our Arg-I
world Arg-I
more Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
pride Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
rage Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
educate Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
love Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
from Arg-I
saving Arg-I
minority Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

Although O
governments Arg-B
invest Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
doing Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
results Arg-I
. O

As O
evidence O
of O
this O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
the Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
, Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
collecting Arg-I
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
those Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
languages Arg-I
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
and Arg-I
unpopular Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
preservations Arg-I
need Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
, Arg-I
restore Arg-I
all Arg-I
information Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
train Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
educational Arg-I
centre Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
try Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
protection Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
halted Arg-I
and Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
all Arg-B
languages Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
and Arg-I
developed Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

All O
people O
should O
give O
a O
hand O
to O
do O
this O
better O
and O
governments O
play O
a O
vital O
role O
on O
encouraging O
and O
distributing O
those O
. O

Do O
arts O
and O
music O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
? O

My O
view O
is O
that O
the O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
give Arg-I
priorities Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
basic Arg-I
social Arg-I
welfares Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
housing Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
subsidizing Arg-I
arts Arg-I
relative Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Art Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
key Arg-I
determination Arg-I
of Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
better Arg-I
off Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
urgent Arg-I
for Arg-I
governments Arg-I
to Arg-I
commit Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
help Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
setting Arg-I
more Arg-I
scholarships Arg-I
in Arg-I
education Arg-I
section Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
simply O
because O
knowledge Arg-B
and Arg-I
wisdom Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
enhancement Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
rounded Arg-I
social Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
art Arg-B
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
extent Arg-I
, Arg-I
serve Arg-I
a Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
function Arg-I
about Arg-I
enriching Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
daily Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, O
for O
example O
, O
it Arg-B
could Arg-I
bring Arg-I
release Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
burden Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
and Arg-I
refresh Arg-I
human Arg-I
bodies Arg-I
through Arg-I
a Arg-I
hard Arg-I
day Arg-I
from Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
unrealistic Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursuit Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
high Arg-I
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
the Arg-I
basic Arg-I
housing Arg-I
supply Arg-I
has Arg-I
still Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
problem Arg-I
with Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
lower Arg-I
income Arg-I
family Arg-I
have Arg-I
squeezed Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
tight Arg-I
room Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
comparison Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
issues Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
pursuit Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
seems Arg-I
unimportant Arg-I
at Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
art Arg-B
could Arg-I
play Arg-I
an Arg-I
active Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
improving Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
attach Arg-I
heavier Arg-I
weight Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
social Arg-I
issues Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
housing Arg-I
needs Arg-I
because O
those Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
essential Arg-I
ways Arg-I
enable Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
a Arg-I
decent Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Government O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
education O
and O
health O
care O
or O
not O
? O

Despite O
the O
development O
of O
modern O
society O
, O
the O
health O
care O
and O
education O
still O
remain O
the O
basic O
rights O
of O
citizens O
. O

And O
a O
much O
debated O
issue O
these O
days O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
government O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
citizens O
' O
health O
care O
and O
education O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
that Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
obligated Arg-I
to Arg-I
fund Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
for Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
citizens Arg-B
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
harmonious Arg-I
and Arg-I
stable Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
enabled Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
leader Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
citizens Arg-I
had Arg-I
no Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
physical Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
soundness Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
at Arg-I
risk Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
such Arg-B
people Arg-I
might Arg-I
fail Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
cured Arg-I
in Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
influencing Arg-I
their Arg-I
working Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
would Arg-I
destabilize Arg-I
the Arg-I
production Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
without Arg-B
sufficient Arg-I
guidance Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
might Arg-I
misbehave Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
commit Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
, Arg-I
posing Arg-I
a Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
' Arg-I
security Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
accountable Arg-I
for Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
' Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
society Arg-I
safe Arg-I
and Arg-I
stable Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O
people O
oppose O
the O
argument O
, O
saying O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
subsidize Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
, O
since O
a Arg-B
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
fact Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
the Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
both Arg-I
privately Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
give Arg-I
priority Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
pressing Arg-I
problems Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
social Arg-I
members Arg-I
' Arg-I
wellbeing Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
soaring Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
, Arg-I
AIDS Arg-I
epidemic Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
of Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
requiring Arg-I
financial Arg-I
resources Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
address Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
fund Arg-I
the Arg-I
deprived Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
group Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
need Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
authority Arg-I
's Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
citizens O
available O
for O
the O
both O
should O
encourage O
the O
government O
to O
allocate O
money O
to O
more O
urgent O
areas O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
harmonious O
society O
calls O
for O
the O
joint O
efforts O
of O
the O
government O
and O
citizens O
. O

Economic O
development O
vs O
environment O

Currently O
, O
a O
great O
number O
of O
countries O
have O
pushed O
forward O
their O
economies O
by O
developing O
national O
industries O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
are O
worried O
that O
the O
economic O
targets O
in O
industrialized O
countries O
may O
be O
attained O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
ecosystems O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
think O
flourishing Arg-B
economies Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
hand Arg-I
with Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
some Arg-B
countries Arg-I
may Arg-I
place Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
of Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
protection Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
ruining Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
environments Arg-I
. O

As O
these Arg-B
needy Arg-I
countries Arg-I
lack Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
financial Arg-I
and Arg-I
human Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
their Arg-I
living Arg-I
standards Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
people Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
- Arg-I
stricken Arg-I
areas Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
with Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
the Arg-I
ecosystems Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
unchecked Arg-B
and Arg-I
reckless Arg-I
uses Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
raw Arg-I
materials Arg-I
may Arg-I
happen Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
put Arg-I
a Arg-I
strain Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
view O
, O
the Arg-B
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
and Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
protection Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
conflicting Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
the Arg-B
booming Arg-I
economy Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
closely Arg-I
linked Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
people Arg-I
raising Arg-I
their Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
green Arg-I
economy Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
products Arg-I
free Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollutants Arg-I
are Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
prevalent Arg-I
among Arg-I
clients Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
eco Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
favorable Arg-I
impression Arg-I
on Arg-I
customers Arg-I
today Arg-I
, Arg-I
triggering Arg-I
sales Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
electronic Arg-B
bicycles Arg-I
powered Arg-I
by Arg-I
clean Arg-I
energy Arg-I
resources Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
well Arg-I
received Arg-I
among Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
recent Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
taking Arg-B
environmental Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
can Arg-I
enhance Arg-I
working Arg-I
efficiencies Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
a Arg-I
firm Arg-I
is Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
optimal Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
resources Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
its Arg-I
production Arg-I
lines Arg-I
and Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
boost Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
spur Arg-I
its Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
without Arg-B
the Arg-I
requirement Arg-I
of Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
firm Arg-I
would Arg-I
still Arg-I
consume Arg-I
a Arg-I
vast Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
which Arg-I
constitutes Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
operational Arg-I
costs Arg-I
, Arg-I
being Arg-I
a Arg-I
hurdle Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
thriving Arg-B
economies Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
ecosystems Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
simultaneously Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
suppose O
the O
developed O
countries O
should O
support O
the O
underdeveloped O
areas O
by O
providing O
financial O
resources O
, O
technologies O
and O
experience O
so O
that O
the O
environmental O
problems O
can O
be O
effectively O
alleviated O
in O
these O
areas O
. O

Government O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
ARTs O
, O
not O
only O
on O
public O
services O
As O
people O
have O
raised O
their O
democratic O
awareness O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
they O
are O
caring O
more O
about O
how O
the O
tax O
expenditure O
is O
distributed O
by O
the O
government O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some O
people O
suggest O
that O
the O
tax O
money O
should O
be O
allocated O
to O
publically O
beneficial O
services O
instead O
of O
arts O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
think O
arts Arg-B
are Arg-I
supposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
included Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
's Arg-I
investment Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
give Arg-I
priority Arg-I
to Arg-I
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
plays Arg-I
the Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
leader Arg-I
among Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
discharge Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
making Arg-I
optimal Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tax Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
society Arg-I
safe Arg-I
and Arg-I
stable Arg-I
. O

Simultaneously O
, O
public Arg-B
services Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
or Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
can Arg-I
meet Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
basic Arg-I
demand Arg-I
of Arg-I
survival Arg-I
, Arg-I
security Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
making Arg-I
them Arg-I
feel Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
lower Arg-I
the Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
public Arg-B
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
attention Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
social Arg-I
stability Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O

I O
believe O
arts Arg-B
should Arg-I
by Arg-I
no Arg-I
means Arg-I
been Arg-I
disregarded Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Individually O
, O
arts Arg-B
can Arg-I
enrich Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Currently Arg-B
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
occupied Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
studies Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
stiff Arg-I
competition Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
they Arg-B
require Arg-I
various Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
movies Arg-I
or Arg-I
books Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
ease Arg-I
their Arg-I
minds Arg-I
and Arg-I
release Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
arts Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
at Arg-I
risk Arg-I
of Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

From O
the O
point O
of O
the O
local O
community O
, O
funding Arg-B
arts Arg-I
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
and Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

Cultural Arg-B
heritage Arg-I
constitutes Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
arts Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
preserving Arg-B
local Arg-I
arts Arg-I
may Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
heritage Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
helps Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
belonging Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
booming Arg-I
local Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
view O
, O
arts Arg-B
serve Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
and Arg-I
economic Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
. O

With O
those O
arguments O
in O
mind O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
public Arg-B
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
are Arg-I
an Arg-I
integral Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
expenditure Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the Arg-B
authorities Arg-I
should Arg-I
also Arg-I
respect Arg-I
the Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
arts Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
individually Arg-I
and Arg-I
socially Arg-I
advantageous Arg-I
. O

Keeping O
animals O
in O
zoos O

Since O
the O
time O
they O
were O
introduced O
zoos O
have O
both O
been O
supported O
and O
criticized O
. O

Many O
believe O
that O
zoos O
could O
be O
very O
entertaining O
and O
ecologically O
important O
, O
whereas O
, O
others O
think O
that O
keeping O
animals O
in O
captivity O
is O
totally O
wrong O
. O

Both O
sides O
will O
be O
discussed O
before O
a O
reasonable O
conclusion O
is O
drawn O
. O

First O
, O
critics O
of O
zoology O
argue O
that O
keeping Arg-B
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
captivity Arg-I
is Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
because O
animals Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
human Arg-I
persons Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
of Arg-I
having Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environment Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
kept Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
enclosures Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
because O
, O
many Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
the Arg-I
ones Arg-I
in Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
attention Arg-I
which Arg-I
their Arg-I
animals Arg-I
require Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
undernourished Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
sufficient Arg-I
quality Arg-I
and Arg-I
quantity Arg-I
of Arg-I
medical Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
sometimes Arg-B
animals Arg-I
from Arg-I
hot Arg-I
countries Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
survive Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cold Arg-I
winter Arg-I
of Arg-I
somewhere Arg-I
in Arg-I
Europe Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
advocators O
believe O
that O
zoos Arg-B
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
the Arg-I
balance Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
ecology Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
young Arg-I
children Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
and Arg-I
see Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
cute Arg-I
baby Arg-I
- Arg-I
born Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
corners Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Zoos Arg-B
provide Arg-I
educational Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
lives Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
animals Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
zoos Arg-B
play Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
reserving Arg-I
many Arg-I
breeds Arg-I
of Arg-I
animal Arg-I
and Arg-I
preventing Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
missing Arg-I
from Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
in Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
, Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
kept Arg-I
in Arg-I
enclosures Arg-I
which Arg-I
simulate Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
being Arg-I
protected Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
predators Arg-I
or Arg-I
hunters Arg-I
. O

Thus O
zoos Arg-B
are Arg-I
needed Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
balanced Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
both Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
arguments Arg-I
have Arg-I
strong Arg-I
supports Arg-I
, O
but O
in O
my O
own O
view O
, O
more Arg-B
good Arg-I
come Arg-I
from Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
than Arg-I
bad Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
the O
standards O
of O
zoos O
should O
be O
leveled O
up O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
animals O
in O
zoos O
are O
provided O
with O
good O
care O
and O
attention O
. O

Artists O
' O
freedom O
to O
express O
ideas O
Artists O
in O
most O
countries O
are O
given O
the O
freedom O
to O
express O
their O
thoughts O
in O
whatever O
they O
do O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
argue O
that O
there O
should O
be O
government O
restrictions O
in O
order O
to O
limit O
their O
opinions O
. O

I O
however O
, O
agree O
to O
this O
only O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
and O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
artists Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
produce Arg-I
some Arg-I
really Arg-I
marvelous Arg-I
masterpiece Arg-I
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
control Arg-I
over Arg-I
artists Arg-I
' Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
artists Arg-I
will Arg-I
think Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
box Arg-I
and Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
spectacular Arg-I
Arts Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
paintings Arg-B
by Arg-I
Da Arg-I
Vinci Arg-I
and Arg-I
Michallengo Arg-I
are Arg-I
admired Arg-I
even Arg-I
till Arg-I
now Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
were Arg-I
not Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
during Arg-I
those Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
without Arg-B
any Arg-I
limitations Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
awe Arg-I
inspiring Arg-I
work Arg-I
from Arg-I
our Arg-I
artists Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
every Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
voice Arg-I
out Arg-I
their Arg-I
opinions Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
ways Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
cause Arg-I
any Arg-I
problems Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

Today Arg-B
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
make Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
democratic Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Arts Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
ways Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
criticise Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
government Arg-I
policies Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
the Arg-B
famous Arg-I
movie Arg-I
' Arg-I
3 Arg-I
Idiots Arg-I
' Arg-I
acted Arg-I
by Arg-I
Amir Arg-I
Khan Arg-I
criticises Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
chiefly Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
memorising Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
being Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
human Arg-B
rights Arg-I
is Arg-I
violated Arg-I
if Arg-I
artists Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
their Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
freely Arg-I
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
drawbacks O
if O
artists O
are O
not O
restricted O
. O

They Arg-B
might Arg-I
go Arg-I
deeper Arg-I
into Arg-I
certain Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
cause Arg-I
controversies Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
Malaysia Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
multiracial Arg-I
country Arg-I
whereby Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
live Arg-I
together Arg-I
in Arg-I
harmony Arg-I
and Arg-I
peace Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
case Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
who Arg-I
brings Arg-I
up Arg-I
some Arg-I
sensitive Arg-I
issues Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
films Arg-I
or Arg-I
books Arg-I
regarding Arg-I
any Arg-I
races Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
might Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
chaos Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
artists Arg-B
know Arg-I
their Arg-I
boundaries Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
and Arg-I
would Arg-I
surely Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
their Arg-I
names Arg-I
tarnished Arg-I
just Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
unscrupulous Arg-I
acts Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it O
is O
now O
evident O
that O
there Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
any Arg-I
restrictions Arg-I
on Arg-I
artists Arg-I
' Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Allowing Arg-B
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
freely Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
as O
ideas Arg-B
can Arg-I
naturally Arg-I
flow Arg-I
when Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
no Arg-I
limitations Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
even Arg-B
though Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
, O
I O
certainly O
believe O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
and Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
Arts Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
and O
thus O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
there Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
restrictions Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

The O
nuclear O
power O
provide O
clean O
and O
cheap O
energy O

The O
topic O
of O
nuclear O
technology O
frequently O
generates O
a O
heated O
debate O
with O
proponents O
maintaining O
that O
nuclear O
power O
provides O
a O
source O
of O
efficient O
and O
economical O
energy O
while O
opponents O
argue O
that O
atomic O
technology O
is O
uncontrollable O
and O
very O
dangerous O
to O
handle O
. O

As O
far O
as O
my O
opinion O
is O
concerned O
, O
I Arg-B
find Arg-I
myself Arg-I
aligned Arg-I
with Arg-I
opponents Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
usages Arg-I
of Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
power Arg-I
. O

I O
have O
several O
reasons O
to O
believe O
its O
disadvantages O
outnumber O
the O
few O
advantages O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
reason O
is O
that O
pursuit Arg-B
of Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
technology Arg-I
one Arg-I
way Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
leads Arg-I
towards Arg-I
atomic Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
. O

Last Arg-B
century Arg-I
has Arg-I
witnessed Arg-I
the Arg-I
horrors Arg-I
of Arg-I
such Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
each Arg-I
country Arg-I
pursues Arg-I
the Arg-I
fusion Arg-I
and Arg-I
fission Arg-I
process Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
may Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
mold Arg-I
it Arg-I
for Arg-I
military Arg-I
usage Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
to O
fortify O
my O
opinion O
is O
that O
even Arg-B
civil Arg-I
usages Arg-I
of Arg-I
atomic Arg-I
power Arg-I
pose Arg-I
a Arg-I
dire Arg-I
threat Arg-I
of Arg-I
radio Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
recently Arg-B
there Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
an Arg-I
incident Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
an Arg-I
atomic Arg-I
power Arg-I
house Arg-I
leaked Arg-I
tons Arg-I
of Arg-I
radio Arg-I
active Arg-I
material Arg-I
into Arg-I
air Arg-I
when Arg-I
an Arg-I
earthquake Arg-I
hit Arg-I
the Arg-I
surrounding Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
unfortunate Arg-I
event Arg-I
proves Arg-I
that Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
how Arg-I
much Arg-I
careful Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
such Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
are Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
while Arg-B
generating Arg-I
energy Arg-I
from Arg-I
any Arg-I
source Arg-I
be Arg-I
it Arg-I
hydro Arg-I
power Arg-I
or Arg-I
oil Arg-I
there Arg-I
always Arg-I
is Arg-I
some Arg-I
wastage Arg-I

and Arg-I
so Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
case Arg-I
with Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
power Arg-I
. O

Safely Arg-B
getting Arg-I
rid Arg-I
of Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
waste Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
daunting Arg-I
task Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
has Arg-I
not Arg-I
been Arg-I
any Arg-I
permanent Arg-I
solution Arg-I
of Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
waste Arg-I
is Arg-I
many Arg-I
times Arg-I
more Arg-I
lethal Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
environment Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
hazardous Arg-I
material Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
from O
above O
mentioned O
facts O
it O
can O
easily O
be O
deduced O
that O
nuclear Arg-B
power Arg-I
may Arg-I
appear Arg-I
silver Arg-I
bullet Arg-I
for Arg-I
energy Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
but Arg-I
its Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
far Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

Thus O
I O
suggest O
that O
use O
of O
nuclear O
technology O
should O
be O
discouraged O
even O
for O
civil O
purposes O
. O

Giving O
mobile O
phones O
to O
the O
unemployed O
Today O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
unemployment O
is O
on O
the O
rise O
and O
is O
seriously O
being O
debated O
by O
many O
. O

Some O
opine O
that O
the O
best O
method O
to O
minimize O
this O
problem O
is O
by O
providing O
the O
unemployed O
with O
hand O
phones O
that O
have O
access O
to O
the O
Internet O
. O

They O
also O
believe O
that O
this O
solution O
is O
the O
most O
appropriate O
way O
to O
utilize O
the O
public O
money O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
agree O
to O
this O
solution O
only O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
because O
I O
feel O
that O
giving Arg-B
those Arg-I
with Arg-I
no Arg-I
work Arg-I
a Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
each Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
total Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
positive O
point O
of O
view O
, O
when Arg-B
people Arg-I
without Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
have Arg-I
hand Arg-I
phones Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
browse Arg-I
the Arg-I
net Arg-I
for Arg-I
more Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
surf Arg-I
the Arg-I
The Arg-I
Star Arg-I
Onlines Arg-I
' Arg-I
work Arg-I
section Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I

that Arg-I

for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I

, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
do Arg-I

found Arg-I
apart Arg-I
from Arg-I
looking Arg-I
up Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
calls Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
companies Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
provides Arg-I
those Arg-I
without Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
an Arg-I
occupation Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
survive Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
supplying Arg-B
hand Arg-I
phones Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
taxpayers Arg-I
' Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
the Arg-B
money Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
supply Arg-I
the Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
gadget Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
useful Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
the Arg-B
money Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
more Arg-I
amenities Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
or Arg-I
given Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
poor Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
it Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
earn Arg-I
a Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the Arg-B
money Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
intentions Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
giving Arg-I
hand Arg-I
phones Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
when Arg-B
hand Arg-I
phones Arg-I
are Arg-I
provided Arg-I
for Arg-I
free Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
would Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
surprising Arg-I
that Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
a Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
make Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
jobless Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
might Arg-I
even Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
extent Arg-I
of Arg-I
lying Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
on Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
eligible Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
the Arg-B
public Arg-I
's Arg-I
money Arg-I
is Arg-I
spent Arg-I
worthlessly Arg-I
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
till Arg-B
now Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
no Arg-I
surveys Arg-I
or Arg-I
evidences Arg-I
that Arg-I
prove Arg-I
this Arg-I
method Arg-I
in Arg-I
effective Arg-I
in Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
the Arg-I
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the O
suggestion O
of O
providing Arg-B
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
jobless Arg-I
with Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
accessible Arg-I
to Arg-I
internet Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
proper Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
trim Arg-I
down Arg-I
the Arg-I
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
. O

I O
suggest O
the O
government O
look O
into O
the O
background O
of O
the O
people O
in O
depth O
before O
giving O
out O
hand O
phones O
to O
them O
. O

I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the O
public O
money O
should O
be O
utilized O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
society O
and O
not O
just O
for O
some O
of O
them O
who O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
put O
in O
more O
effort O
to O
find O
them O
a O
proper O
work O
. O

Use O
of O
CCTV O
cameras O
Today O
, O
close O
circuit O
television O
( O
CCTV O
) O
cameras O
are O
widely O
used O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
circumstances O
. O

They O
are O
used O
in O
schools O
, O
businesses O
and O
some O
other O
premises O
in O
order O
to O
monitor O
the O
activities O
taking O
place O
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the O
use O
of O
CCTV O
has O
plenty O
of O
benefits O
to O
offer O
, O
especially O
in O
reducing O
crimes O
and O
protecting O
the O
employees O
in O
a O
premise O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
argue O
that O
these O
cameras O
invade O
their O
privacies O
due O
to O
constantly O
being O
monitored O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
CCTV Arg-B
cameras Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
installed Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
premise Arg-I
to Arg-I
combat Arg-I
the Arg-I
ever Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
theft Arg-I
rate Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
by Arg-B
having Arg-I
CCTV Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
at Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
, Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
robbery Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
trimmed Arg-I
down Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
when Arg-B
a Arg-I
shop Arg-I
is Arg-I
attacked Arg-I
by Arg-I
thieves Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
clips Arg-I
taken Arg-I
by Arg-I
these Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
serve Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
evidence Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
thieves Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
traced Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
in Arg-B
Malaysia Arg-I
, Arg-I
policemen Arg-I
used Arg-I
the Arg-I
videos Arg-I
captured Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
CCTV Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
to Arg-I
trace Arg-I
and Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
catch Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
robbers Arg-I
who Arg-I
broke Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
Seven Arg-I
Eleven Arg-I
shop Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
midnight Arg-I
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
as Arg-B
the Arg-I
employees Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
under Arg-I
constant Arg-I
surveillance Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
less Arg-I
likely Arg-I
steal Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
shops Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
CCTVs Arg-B
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rates Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
minimized Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
at Arg-B
some Arg-I
offices Arg-I
, Arg-I
employees Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
handle Arg-I
angry Arg-I
or Arg-I
frustrated Arg-I
customers Arg-I
. O

At O
times O
, O
face Arg-B
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
with Arg-I
an Arg-I
annoyed Arg-I
customer Arg-I
can Arg-I
put Arg-I
the Arg-I
employee Arg-I
in Arg-I
physical Arg-I
danger Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
the Arg-B
installation Arg-I
of Arg-I
CCTV Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
may Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
employees Arg-I
escape Arg-I
this Arg-I
situation Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
customers Arg-I
know Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
conversations Arg-I
are Arg-I
recorded Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
event O
of O
an O
argument O
, O
the Arg-B
videotapes Arg-I
can Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
determine Arg-I
what Arg-I
actually Arg-I
took Arg-I
place Arg-I
and Arg-I
further Arg-I
actions Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
then Arg-I
taken Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
these Arg-B
cameras Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
some Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
protection Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
against Arg-I
the Arg-I
customers Arg-I
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
the O
use O
of O
CCTV O
cameras O
does O
cause O
controversy O
. O

Those Arg-B
opposing Arg-I
the Arg-I
CCTV Arg-I
systems Arg-I
feel Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
privacies Arg-I
are Arg-I
invaded Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
constant Arg-I
monitoring Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
one Arg-B
must Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
safety Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
paramount Arg-I
importance Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
privacy Arg-I
and Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
. O

Ergo O
, O
opponents Arg-B
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
system Arg-I
should Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
actions Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
victims Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
CCTV Arg-B
cameras Arg-I
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
installed Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
premise Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
chiefly Arg-I
to Arg-I
shield Arg-I
oneself Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
harmed Arg-I
by Arg-I
any Arg-I
intruders Arg-I
or Arg-I
robbers Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
privacies Arg-B
are Arg-I
lost Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
cameras Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
safety Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
first Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
safe Arg-I
. O

Some O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
a O
company O
, O
some O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
themselves O

There O
are O
many O
kinds O
of O
jobs O
in O
society O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
done O
by O
companies O
that O
related O
to O
government O
, O
and O
some O
of O
them O
are O
done O
by O
privat O
companies O
. O

Although O
both O
companies O
have O
their O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
myself Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
many O
benefits O
when O
people O
work O
for O
themselves O
rather O
than O
work O
for O
the O
others O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
in Arg-I
privat Arg-I
works Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
them Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
your Arg-I
job Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
boss Arg-I
of Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
; Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
someone Arg-I
else Arg-I
are Arg-I
your Arg-I
boss Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
always Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
your Arg-I
task Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
situation Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
never Arg-I
like Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
when Arg-B
people Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
they Arg-I
make Arg-I
more Arg-I
profit Arg-I
for Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
you Arg-I
make Arg-I
profits Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
your Arg-I
manager Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
nowadays Arg-B
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
pick Arg-I
up Arg-I
this Arg-I
profit Arg-I
without Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
sum Arg-I
of Arg-I
it Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
workers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
in Arg-I
privat Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
that Arg-I
workers Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
looking Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
punch Arg-I
in Arg-I
and Arg-I
punch Arg-I
out Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
some Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
happen Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
a Arg-I
disease Arg-I
, Arg-I
sticking Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometime Arg-I
going Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
vacation Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
permission Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
working Arg-B
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, O
too O
, O
but O
I O
imagine O
people Arg-B
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
, Arg-I
profits Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
. O

The O
expression O
" O
Never O
, O
never O
give O
up O
" O
means O
keep O
trying O
and O
never O
stop O
working O
Many O
individuals O
throughout O
their O
life O
face O
with O
at O
least O
one O
failure O
in O
different O
areas O
such O
as O
education O
, O
love O
and O
economy O
. O

Some O
believe O
when O
a O
person O
faces O
with O
a O
failure O
the O
best O
way O
is O
to O
forget O
that O
and O
releases O
that O
; O
however O
, O
I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
this O
idea O
. O

I O
always O
believe O
that O
a Arg-B
defeated Arg-I
person Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
and Arg-I
try Arg-I
until Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
her Arg-I
or Arg-I
his Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when Arg-B
people Arg-I
face Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
failure Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
from Arg-I
that Arg-I
failure Arg-I
, Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
effort Arg-I
they Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
doing Arg-I
and Arg-I
repeating Arg-I
that Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
inventors Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
phases Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
face Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
defeats Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
stages Arg-I
they Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
experience Arg-B
shows Arg-I
while Arg-I
people Arg-I
doing Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
subject Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
effort Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
successful Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
percentile Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
scientists Arg-B
experiment Arg-I
a Arg-I
substance Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
they Arg-I
gain Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
that Arg-I
subject Arg-I
they Arg-I
decide Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
final Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
maintain O
that O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
up Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
face Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
failure Arg-I
. O

In O
opposite O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
new Arg-I
points Arg-I
from Arg-I
that Arg-I
failure Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
human O
needs O
for O
farmland O
, O
housing O
and O
industry O
are O
more O
Nowadays O
there O
are O
some O
issues O
which O
many O
countries O
and O
nations O
are O
concern O
about O
that O
. O

Two O
of O
the O
most O
important O
of O
them O
are O
rate O
of O
increasing O
population O
and O
endangered O
plants O
and O
animals O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
although O
endangered Arg-B
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
, O
human Arg-B
needs Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
day Arg-B
by Arg-I
day Arg-I
population Arg-I
is Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
, O
so O
human Arg-B
needs Arg-I
for Arg-I
food Arg-I
is Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
need Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
to Arg-I
grow Arg-I
crops Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
wheat Arg-I
and Arg-I
corn Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
that Arg-I
without Arg-I
food Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
alive Arg-I
for Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
some Arg-I
weeks Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
farmlands Arg-B
are Arg-I
vital Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
people Arg-B
need Arg-I
shelters Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
from Arg-I
mother Arg-I
nature Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
wind Arg-I
and Arg-I
flood Arg-I
and Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
need Arg-I
land Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
their Arg-I
houses Arg-I
on Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Dwelling Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
human Arg-I
needs Arg-I
after Arg-I
food Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
human Arg-B
need Arg-I
some Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
things Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
some Arg-B
lands Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
assigned Arg-I
to Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

Todays Arg-B
life Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
which Arg-I
become Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the Arg-B
population Arg-I
of Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
population Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
land Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

I O
would O
maintain O
that O
nowadays Arg-B
humans Arg-I
need Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
because O
of O
increasing Arg-B
population Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
saving Arg-I
land Arg-I
for Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Best O
way O
to O
judge O
about O
people O
is O
to O
be O
familiar O
with O
their O
personality O
- O
not O
with O
their O
look O

Individuals O
have O
two O
features O
, O
one O
of O
them O
is O
appearance O
and O
the O
other O
one O
is O
personality O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
although Arg-B
appearance Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
, O
personality Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
judge Arg-I
about Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
believes O
, O
individuals O
who O
have O
black O
skin O
or O
are O
frown O
are O
not O
good O
person O
and O
in O
opposite O
individuals O
who O
have O
pale O
or O
white O
skin O
or O
always O
have O
smile O
on O
their O
face O
are O
good O
person O
. O

I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
these O
kind O
of O
judgement O
which O
someone O
makes O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
role Arg-I
and Arg-I
cheat Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
playing Arg-I
, O
therefore O
we Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
aware Arg-I
to Arg-I
never Arg-I
judge Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
cheat Arg-I
their Arg-I
fiance Arg-I
before Arg-I
marriage Arg-I
by Arg-I
showing Arg-I
a Arg-I
cheerful Arg-I
face Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
; Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
getting Arg-I
marriage Arg-I
they Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
real Arg-I
personality Arg-I
. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
black Arg-I
skin Arg-I
, Arg-I
fat Arg-I
and Arg-I
frown Arg-I
, Arg-I
nonetheless Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
person Arg-I
for Arg-I
leaving Arg-I
and Arg-I
colleague Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
neighbor Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
old Arg-I
, Arg-I
black Arg-I
skin Arg-I
and Arg-I
frown Arg-I

and Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
always Arg-I
panicked Arg-I
of Arg-I
her Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
day Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
cold Arg-I
winter Arg-I
while Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
getting Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
home Arg-I
from Arg-I
school Arg-I

I Arg-I
realized Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
lost Arg-I
my Arg-I
keys Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
before Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
getting Arg-I
back Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

She Arg-B
asked Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
with Arg-I
her Arg-I
till Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
come Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
she Arg-I
was Arg-I
great Arg-I
in Arg-I
hospitality Arg-I
and Arg-I
her Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
was Arg-I
unforgettable Arg-I
. O

After O
that O
I O
understood O
, O
I Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
never Arg-I
judge Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
judge Arg-I
about Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
' Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
personality Arg-I
not Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
people O
play O
role O
to O
cheat O
the O
others O
, O
and O
they O
try O
to O
hide O
their O
real O
personality O
with O
their O
appearance O
. O

should O
one O
follow O
fashion O
trends O
rather O
than O
a O
personal O
style O
? O

With O
increasing O
availability O
to O
the O
Internet O
, O
people O
can O
collect O
a O
wealth O
of O
information O
about O
the O
latest O
fashion O
trends O
over O
the O
world O
, O
such O
as O
the O
most O
popular O
shoes O
style O
this O
season O
or O
the O
best O
- O
liked O
clothes O
color O
this O
year O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
that O
dressing O
in O
a O
personal O
style O
should O
be O
advocated O
rather O
than O
following O
fashion O
trends O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
fashion Arg-B
trends Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
role Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
than Arg-I
personal Arg-I
dressing Arg-I
styles Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
following Arg-B
fashion Arg-I
trends Arg-I
enables Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
latest Arg-I
transformations Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
vital Arg-I
importance Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
consider Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
global Arg-I
village Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
individuals Arg-I
keep Arg-I
the Arg-I
habit Arg-I
of Arg-I
grasping Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
cutting Arg-I
- Arg-I
edge Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
changing Arg-I
their Arg-I
attitudes Arg-I
to Arg-I
viewing Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
open Arg-I
to Arg-I
accept Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
voices Arg-I
from Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
stuck Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
styles Arg-I
, Arg-I
disregarding Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
top Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
designers Arg-I
' Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
stay Arg-I
conservative Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
worlds Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
might Arg-I
fall Arg-I
behind Arg-I
shortly Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
people Arg-B
with Arg-I
inadequate Arg-I
aesthetic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
or Arg-I
poor Arg-I
originality Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
senses Arg-I
of Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
when Arg-I
treasuring Arg-I
the Arg-I
latest Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
following Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
trends Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
hard Arg-I
time Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
and Arg-I
matching Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
, Arg-I
let Arg-I
alone Arg-I
forming Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
dressing Arg-I
styles Arg-I
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
following Arg-B
fashion Arg-I
trends Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
may Arg-I
undermine Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
' Arg-I
personalities Arg-I
. O

Individuals Arg-B
purchase Arg-I
their Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
latest Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
trends Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
phenomenon Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
wear Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
style Arg-I
of Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
world Arg-I
would Arg-I
look Arg-I
monotonous Arg-I
. O

With O
those O
arguments O
in O
mind O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
for Arg-I
ones Arg-I
lacking Arg-I
basic Arg-I
aesthetic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
care Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
trends Arg-I
in Arg-I
lives Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
keep Arg-I
pace Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I

changes Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
creative Arg-B
design Arg-I
talents Arg-I
can Arg-I
value Arg-I
their Arg-I

developing Arg-I
their Arg-I

Should O

Whether O

should O
take O
responsibilities O

, O
by O

remain O

of O
the O

Personally O
I O
think O
, O
as Arg-B
the Arg-I
privileged Arg-I
minority Arg-I
, Arg-I
wealthy Arg-I
nations Arg-I
have Arg-I
every Arg-I
reason Arg-I
to Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
fortune Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
poor Arg-I
. O

In O
terms O
of O
ethics O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
inhumane Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
one Arg-I

fellowman Arg-I
struggle Arg-I
against Arg-I
famine Arg-I
and Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
without Arg-I

anything Arg-I

when Arg-I
the Arg-I

Compassion Arg-B

almost Arg-I
all Arg-I

what Arg-I

us Arg-I
human Arg-I

Economically O

such Arg-B

For Arg-B

By Arg-B

a Arg-I
good Arg-I

First O
of O
all O
, O
thank Arg-B
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
full Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
childhoods Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
habits Arg-I
of Arg-I
taking Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
these Arg-I
habits Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
kept Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
adolescences Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
is Arg-I
educated Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
hygienic Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
young Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
also Arg-I
keeps Arg-I
it Arg-I
when Arg-I
older Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
health Arg-B
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
especially Arg-I
children Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
from Arg-I
risks Arg-I
of Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
afraid Arg-I
or Arg-I
panic Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
calmer Arg-I
if Arg-I
unfortunately Arg-I

some Arg-I
normal Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I

Many Arg-B
diseases Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
cured Arg-I
easily Arg-I
can Arg-I
turn Arg-I
to Arg-I
serious Arg-I
ones Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
right Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
. O

Health Arg-B
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
right Arg-I
choices Arg-I
of Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
to Arg-I
recover Arg-I
more Arg-I
quickly Arg-I

Preventative Arg-B
measures Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
improve Arg-I
general Arg-I
health Arg-I
state Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
vaccines Arg-B
will Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
that Arg-I
pregnant Arg-I
women Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
babies Arg-I
are Arg-I
protected Arg-I
from Arg-I
serious Arg-I
infectious Arg-I

such Arg-I
as Arg-I

When Arg-B

our Arg-I
country Arg-I

As O

state Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
totally Arg-I
right Arg-I
decision Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
because O
the Arg-B
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
is Arg-I
often Arg-I
much Arg-I
higher Arg-I
than Arg-I
that Arg-I
of Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
our Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
budget Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
give Arg-I
more Arg-I
priority Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
preventative Arg-I
measures Arg-I
than Arg-I
to Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
reasonable Arg-B
attentions Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
paid Arg-I
to Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
our Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
looked Arg-I
after Arg-I
with Arg-I
best Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

The O
popularity O
of O
news O
media O
Nowadays O
news O
media O
have O
become O
more O
and O
more O
popular O
. O

Many O
people O
consider O
that O
the O
drawbacks O
of O
this O
phenomenon O
outweigh O
its O
merits O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
this O
idea O
is O
not O
completely O
true O
. O

It O
is O
widely O
seen O
that O
news Arg-B
media Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
brings Arg-I
people Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
polishes Arg-I
up Arg-I
people Arg-I
' Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
not O
unreasonable O
to O
suggest O
that O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
development O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
today Arg-B
entertainment Arg-I
is Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
than Arg-I
ever Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
fact Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
such Arg-I
news Arg-I
media Arg-I
as Arg-I
televisions Arg-I
, Arg-I
radios Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
are Arg-I
bringing Arg-I
many Arg-I
news Arg-I
on Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
sector Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
to Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
sit Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
televisions Arg-I
and Arg-I
watch Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
musical Arg-I
concerts Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
football Arg-I
match Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
relaxation Arg-I
after Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
the Arg-B
popularity Arg-I
of Arg-I
news Arg-I
media Arg-I
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
news Arg-B
media Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
clearly Arg-I
seen Arg-I
that Arg-I
mass Arg-I
media Arg-I
provide Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
global Arg-I
news Arg-I
on Arg-I
all Arg-I
fields Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
political Arg-I
situation Arg-I
, Arg-I
economic Arg-I
change Arg-I
, Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
strong Arg-I
likelihood Arg-I
that Arg-I
today Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
essential Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
process Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
permeating Arg-I
into Arg-I
all Arg-I
areas Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
the Arg-B
fast Arg-I
growth Arg-I
of Arg-I
news Arg-I
media Arg-I
is Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
news Arg-I
media Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
making Arg-I
great Arg-I
inroads Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
lives Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
relaxes Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
plentiful Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
news Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
enriches Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
with Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
also Arg-I
positively Arg-I
affects Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
people Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
progress Arg-I
of Arg-I
news Arg-I
media Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
advantageous Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

Jury O
must O
have O
access O
to O
criminals O
' O
past O
records O

It O
is O
a O
well O
known O
fact O
that O
a O
jury O
involved O
in O
a O
case O
has O
no O
information O
regarding O
the O
criminal O
's O
past O
illegal O
acts O
under O
the O
British O
and O
Australian O
laws O
. O

There O
are O
few O
of O
those O
who O
are O
concerned O
think O
the O
current O
practice O
should O
be O
altered O
and O
that O
the Arg-B
juries Arg-I
should Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
know Arg-I
something Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
before Arg-I
coming Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
conclusion Arg-I
. O

I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
agree O
to O
this O
resolution O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
as O
it O
poses O
advantages O
to O
various O
parties O
as O
I O
shall O
discuss O
below O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
juries Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
decision Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
, O
knowing Arg-B
their Arg-I
background Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
will Arg-I
enable Arg-I
the Arg-I
juries Arg-I
to Arg-I
analyze Arg-I
the Arg-I
crime Arg-I
before Arg-I
coming Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
judgment Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
take Arg-B
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
not Arg-I
murdered Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
but Arg-I
is Arg-I
suddenly Arg-I
found Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
guilty Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
juries Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
weather Arg-I
the Arg-I
individual Arg-I
committed Arg-I
the Arg-I
crime Arg-I
intentionally Arg-I
or Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
circumstances Arg-I
by Arg-I
knowing Arg-I
the Arg-I
facts Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

Then O
, O
punishment Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
in Arg-I
accordance Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
condition Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
a Arg-B
fair Arg-I
trial Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
achieved Arg-I
. O

As O
all O
of O
us O
know O
, O
juries Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
or Arg-I
less Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
regarding Arg-I
law Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
exposing Arg-B
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
records Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
room Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
rationally Arg-I
and Arg-I
finally Arg-I
put Arg-I
the Arg-I
pieces Arg-I
together Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
produce Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
meaningful Arg-I
decision Arg-I
. O

By O
doing O
so O
, O
the Arg-B
juries Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
relief Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
better Arg-I
conclusion Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
evidences Arg-I
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
convicted Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
fair Arg-I
action Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
when Arg-B
the Arg-I
background Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
convicted Arg-I
is Arg-I
' Arg-I
dug Arg-I
' Arg-I
deeper Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
revealed Arg-I
to Arg-I
mass Arg-I
of Arg-I
anonymous Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
privacy Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
jeopardized Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
finally Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
proven Arg-I
innocent Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
may Arg-I
feel Arg-I
embarrassed Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
the Arg-B
crimes Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
brought Arg-I
to Arg-I
light Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
it Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
victim Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
definitely O
feel O
that O
the Arg-B
current Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
juries Arg-I
judging Arg-I
the Arg-I
case Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
transformed Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
facts Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
dealing Arg-I
with Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
of O
paramount O
importance O
so O
that O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
and Arg-I
reliable Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
fair Arg-I
judgment Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
convicted Arg-I
. O

Beneficial O
changes O
will O
certainly O
take O
place O
if O
changes O
are O
made O
because O
for O
a O
change O
to O
happen O
, O
changes O
have O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Taking O
a O
break O
before O
starting O
higher O
education O
is O
a O
good O
idea O

Nowadays O
, O
it O
is O
an O
increasingly O
common O
trend O
to O
take O
a O
break O
before O
starting O
university O
studies O
. O

It O
is O
not O
just O
becoming O
common O
among O
rich O
students O
but O
also O
in O
the O
poor O
students O
. O

Students O
take O
a O
break O
of O
year O
or O
two O
, O
some O
students O
travel O
all O
around O
the O
world O
during O
this O
time O
, O
and O
some O
choose O
to O
take O
up O
a O
job O
. O

Experience Arg-B
gained Arg-I
through Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
to Arg-I
different Arg-I
places Arg-I
, Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
different Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
at Arg-I
job Arg-I
goes Arg-I
long Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
enhances Arg-I
the Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
independent Arg-I
. O

Student Arg-B
's Arg-I
who Arg-I
works Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
better Arg-I
financial Arg-I
resources Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
university Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
experience Arg-I
also Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
develop Arg-I
broader Arg-I
view Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
choice Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
studies Arg-I
or Arg-I
courses Arg-I
. O

Taking Arg-B
a Arg-I
break Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
has Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
also Arg-I
comes Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
. O

Once Arg-B
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
starts Arg-I
earning Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
studies Arg-I
where Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
financial Arg-I
independence Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
might Arg-I
even Arg-I
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
risk Arg-I
of Arg-I
student Arg-I
never Arg-I
going Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
university Arg-I
or Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Probably Arg-B
some Arg-I
might Arg-I
take Arg-I
some Arg-I
short Arg-I
term Arg-I
courses Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
proper Arg-I
and Arg-I
complete Arg-I
university Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
might Arg-I
only Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
run Arg-I
as Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
known Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
career Arg-I
in Arg-I
longer Arg-I
runs Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
needs Arg-I
a Arg-I
proper Arg-I
and Arg-I
higher Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
view O
point O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
agree Arg-I
to Arg-I
idea Arg-I
of Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
break Arg-I
before Arg-I
starting Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
who Arg-I
take Arg-I
break Arg-I
, Arg-I
gain Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
by Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
places Arg-I
or Arg-I
by Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
more Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
mature Arg-I
. O

University O
education O
is O
needed O
for O
success O
In O
today O
's O
modern O
and O
competitive O
society O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
we O
must O
equip O
ourselves O
with O
plenty O
of O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
in O
order O
to O
shine O
and O
to O
be O
successful O
in O
life O
. O

Many O
opine O
that O
the O
aforementioned O
aspects O
are O
mostly O
obtained O
through O
learning O
in O
academic O
institutions O
. O

I O
do O
agree O
to O
that O
opinion O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
one Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
shine Arg-I
without Arg-I
even Arg-I
having Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
true Arg-I
that Arg-I
university Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
paramount Arg-I
importance Arg-I
for Arg-I
certain Arg-I
professions Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
doctor Arg-I
, Arg-I
engineer Arg-I
and Arg-I
lawyer Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
proper Arg-I
training Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
perform Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
careers Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
network Arg-I
for Arg-I
business Arg-I
associates Arg-I
and Arg-I
partners Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
future Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
intend Arg-I
to Arg-I
open Arg-I
up Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
companies Arg-I
or Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
. O

Looking O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
fields Arg-I
without Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
start Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
people Arg-I
depend Arg-I
solely Arg-I
on Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
luck Arg-I
. O

Interestingly O
, O
for Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
it Arg-I
proved Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
profitable Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
Michael Arg-B
Dell Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
founder Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
CEO Arg-I
of Arg-I
Dell Arg-I
left Arg-I
college Arg-I
at Arg-I
19 Arg-I

Initially O
, O
he Arg-B
started Arg-I
his Arg-I
computer Arg-I
company Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
college Arg-I
dorm Arg-I
room Arg-I
. O

Eventually O
, O
he Arg-B
used Arg-I
his Arg-I
earnings Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I

loan Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
progress Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
who Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
now Arg-I

In O

people Arg-B
with Arg-I
natural Arg-I
talents Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
most Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
excel Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
especially Arg-I
true Arg-I
in Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
like Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
and Arg-I
sports Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
introduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
reality Arg-I
shows Arg-I
have Arg-I
made Arg-I
it Arg-I
possible Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
those Arg-I
lucky Arg-I
ones Arg-I
to Arg-I
triumph Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
David Arg-B
Archuleta Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
once Arg-I
a Arg-I
nobody Arg-I
has Arg-I
now Arg-I
taken Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
space Arg-I
in Arg-I
hearts Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
individuals Arg-B
born Arg-I
with Arg-I
talents Arg-I
have Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
. O

To O
wrap O
it O
all O
up O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
true Arg-I
that Arg-I
university Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
for Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
prosper Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
to Arg-I
say Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
success Arg-I
completely Arg-I
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
receives Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
. O

Natural O
talent O
and O
hard O
work O
also O
contribute O
to O
their O
progress O
. O

Should O
people O
be O
forced O
to O
stop O
working O
? O

The O
appropriate O
age O
at O
which O
a O
person O
should O
stop O
working O
is O
now O
a O
much O
debated O
issue O
in O
the O
society O
. O

Some O
opine O
that O
people O
should O
be O
given O
the O
option O
to O
choose O
when O
they O
want O
to O
call O
it O
a O
day O
while O
others O
oppose O
this O
notion O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the Arg-B
right Arg-I
age Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
retire Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
around Arg-I
60 Arg-I
years Arg-I
old Arg-I
. O

I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
strongly Arg-B
agree Arg-I
that Arg-I
age Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
set Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
criterion Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
retire Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
aforementioned Arg-I
age Arg-I
due O
to O
several O
reasons O
that O
I O
shall O
discuss O
below O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
if Arg-B
senior Arg-I
workers Arg-I
dominate Arg-I
the Arg-I
working Arg-I
sector Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
lesser Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
graduates Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
up Arg-I
careers Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
poles Arg-I
apart Arg-I
from Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
had Arg-I
studied Arg-I
for Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
further O
, O
a Arg-B
medical Arg-I
graduate Arg-I
might Arg-I
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
very Arg-I
disheartened Arg-I
when Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
around Arg-I
five Arg-I
precious Arg-I
years Arg-I
studying Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
and Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
up Arg-I
another Arg-I
profession Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
doctor Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
insufficient Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
available Arg-I
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
due Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
genuine Arg-I
passion Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
which Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
option Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
performance Arg-I
standard Arg-I
to Arg-I
dwindle Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
not Arg-B
all Arg-I
elderly Arg-I
workers Arg-I
are Arg-I
physically Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Beyond Arg-B
that Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
elevated Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
contracting Arg-I
a Arg-I
multitude Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
problems Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
stress Arg-I
related Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
and Arg-I
cardiovascular Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
. O

To O
cite O
an O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
stressful Arg-I
life Arg-I
that Arg-I
an Arg-I
aged Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
goes Arg-I
through Arg-I
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
toll Arg-I
on Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
in Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
doing Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
the Arg-B
academic Arg-I
institution Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
medical Arg-I
bills Arg-I
, Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
in Arg-I
more Arg-I
loss Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
institution Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
if Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
older Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
younger Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
expertise Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
senior Arg-I
workers Arg-I
who Arg-I
had Arg-I
retired Arg-I
should Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
underestimated Arg-I
. O

Their Arg-B
invaluable Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
respective Arg-I
fields Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
, Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
law Arg-I
can Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
be Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
younger Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
highly Arg-I
recommended Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
retiree Arg-I
come Arg-I
over Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
companies Arg-I
or Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
regular Arg-I
sessions Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
present Arg-I
staffs Arg-I
to Arg-I
bridge Arg-I
the Arg-I
gap Arg-I
between Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
evident Arg-I
that Arg-I
age Arg-I
limit Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
set Arg-I
for Arg-I
retirement Arg-I
. O

There O
will O
come O
a O
certain O
time O
when O
the O
older O
generation O
should O
hand O
over O
the O
responsibility O
to O
the O
fresh O
comers O
who O
are O
certainly O
waiting O
to O
be O
given O
a O
choice O
to O
prove O
themselves O
. O

After O
all O
, O
retirement O
not O
only O
marks O
the O
end O
of O
an O
individual O
, O
but O
also O
gives O
him O
a O
chance O
to O
make O
up O
for O
what O
he O
has O
lost O
throughout O
his O
working O
life O
. O

Are O
museums O
necessary O
? O

I O
believe O
public Arg-B
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
will Arg-I
still Arg-I
be Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
, O
even O
though O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
works Arg-I
and Arg-I
historical Arg-I
objects Arg-I
online Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
people Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
search Arg-I
for Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
Internet Arg-I
really Arg-I
brings Arg-I
them Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
browse Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
people Arg-B
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
spiritual Arg-I
experience Arg-I
since O
pictures Arg-B
online Arg-I
are Arg-I
only Arg-I
limited Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
screen Arg-I
size Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
the Arg-B
exhibits Arg-I
in Arg-I
museums Arg-I
or Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
are Arg-I
all Arg-I
life Arg-I
size Arg-I
and Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
direct Arg-I
felling Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
only Arg-B
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
mummy Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
we Arg-I
experience Arg-I
mystique Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
exhibits Arg-I
, Arg-I
museums Arg-I
hold Arg-I
various Arg-I
activities Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
be Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
seeing Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
at Arg-B
American Arg-I
Museum Arg-I
of Arg-I

you Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I

at Arg-B

New Arg-I

you Arg-I
can Arg-I
look Arg-I
at Arg-I
17th Arg-I
century Arg-I
instruments Arg-I
while Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I

. O

While Arg-B
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
" Arg-I
visit Arg-I
" Arg-I
the Arg-I
museum Arg-I
online Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
this Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

Seeing Arg-B
an Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
computer Arg-I
screen Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
as Arg-I
you Arg-I
watch Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you Arg-B
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
texture Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
artwork Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
the Arg-I
skills Arg-I
used Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
artist Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
not Arg-B
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
details Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
artwork Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
shown Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
screen Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
details Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
dim Arg-I
since O
the Arg-B
resolution Arg-I
ratio Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
screen Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
high Arg-I
enough Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
may Arg-I
influence Arg-I
the Arg-I
comprehension Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
historical Arg-I
objects Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
we Arg-B
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
but O
computers Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
to Arg-I
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
works Arg-I
or Arg-I
historical Arg-I
objects Arg-I
. O

Should O
the O
cost O
of O
medicines O
be O
reduced O
? O

At O
present O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
patients O
in O
poor O
countries O
are O
suffering O
from O
deaths O
caused O
by O
lack O
of O
medication O
rather O
than O
dangerous O
diseases O
. O

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
companies O
in O
developed O
countries O
ought O
to O
reduce O
their O
price O
of O
medicines O
to O
avoid O
such O
unnecessary O
deaths O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
more Arg-B
lives Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
saved Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
effective Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
medical Arg-I
industry Arg-I
in Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
is Arg-I
incapable Arg-I
of Arg-I
producing Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
quality Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
advanced Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
developed Arg-I
world Arg-I
has Arg-I
achieved Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
breakthroughs Arg-I
in Arg-I
making Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
cure Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
serious Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
gain Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
situations Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
reduction Arg-I
in Arg-I
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
shows Arg-I
the Arg-I
sign Arg-I
of Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
current Arg-I
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
fact Arg-I
, Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
and Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
' Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
the Arg-B
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
researching Arg-I
, Arg-I
testing Arg-I
and Arg-I
producing Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
in Arg-I
masses Arg-I
costs Arg-I
a Arg-I
substantial Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
products Arg-I
prove Arg-I
to Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
human Arg-I
health Arg-I
completely Arg-I
. O

Suppose Arg-B
companies Arg-I
were Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
make Arg-I
no Arg-I
profit Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
running Arg-I
up Arg-I
debt Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
production Arg-I
expenditure Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
measure Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
adopted Arg-I
, Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
those Arg-I
companies Arg-I
will Arg-I
go Arg-I
into Arg-I
liquidation Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
long O
- O
term O
solution O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
other Arg-I
measures Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
advisable Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
medical Arg-I
production Arg-I
by Arg-I
supplying Arg-I
land Arg-I
for Arg-I
building Arg-I
factories Arg-I
and Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
charitable Arg-B
organizations Arg-I
can Arg-I
buy Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
from Arg-I
developed Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
distribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
undeveloped Arg-I
world Arg-I
for Arg-I
free Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
the Arg-I
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
exacerbate Arg-I
their Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
government O
and O
medical O
foundations O
should O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
distribution O
of O
drugs O
to O
the O
undeveloped O
world O
at O
a O
more O
reasonable O
price O
. O

Prohibit O
public O
smoking O
? O

The O
awareness O
on O
harmful O
effects O
from O
smoking O
among O
the O
general O
public O
has O
put O
much O
pressure O
on O
the O
government O
and O
private O
sectors O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some O
businesses O
prohibit O
smoking O
in O
their O
premises O
and O
even O
some O
governments O
restrict O
smoking O
in O
public O
area O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
the Arg-B
move Arg-I
will Arg-I
do Arg-I
more Arg-I
good Arg-I
by Arg-I
looking Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
image Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
nation Arg-I
in Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
well Arg-I
known Arg-I
and Arg-I
clinically Arg-I
proven Arg-I
that Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
hazardous Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
and Arg-I
others Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
fume Arg-I
over Arg-I
a Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Recent Arg-B
death Arg-I
statistic Arg-I
released Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
Malaysian Arg-I
Ministry Arg-I
of Arg-I
Health Arg-I
shows Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
top Arg-I
killer Arg-I
was Arg-I
lung Arg-I
related Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
large Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
death Arg-I
involved Arg-I
second Arg-I
hand Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
young Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
pregnant Arg-I
women Arg-I
who Arg-I
were Arg-I
vulnerable Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
lethal Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
fatality Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
if Arg-I
a Arg-I
total Arg-I
ban Arg-I
on Arg-I
public Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
is Arg-I
implemented Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
image Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
nation Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
when Arg-I
government Arg-I
restricts Arg-I
public Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
by Arg-I
imposing Arg-I
stern Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
offender Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
Brunei Arg-I
government Arg-I
had Arg-I
recently Arg-I
enforced Arg-I
a Arg-I
law Arg-I
against Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
areas Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
cafés Arg-I
, Arg-I
hospital Arg-I
and Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
street Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
step Arg-I
has Arg-I
curbed Arg-I
down Arg-I
the Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
, Arg-I
Brunei Arg-I
remains Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
known Arg-I
for Arg-I
its Arg-I
tranquility Arg-I
and Arg-I
cleanliness Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
example Arg-I
shows Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
of Arg-I
restricting Arg-I
public Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
whole Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
the Arg-B
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
prohibit Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
area Arg-I
is Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
helping Arg-I
in Arg-I
curtailing Arg-I
the Arg-I
associated Arg-I
health Arg-I
risks Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
more O
businesses O
and O
governments O
will O
follow O
the O
same O
initiatives O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
people O
and O
the O
country O
. O

Human O
activities O
are O
harming O
the O
Earth O
" O
Save O
the O
planet O
Earth O
" O
is O
a O
common O
line O
which O
can O
be O
read O
and O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
initiatives O
to O
protect O
the O
planet O
Earth O
from O
unbridled O
human O
developments O
. O

Although O
some O
people O
argue O
these O
developments O
are O
making O
our O
life O
comfortable O
, O
but O
concerns Arg-B
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
are Arg-I
vital Arg-I
due O
to O
various O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
rapid Arg-B
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
is Arg-I
eating Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
forest Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
so Arg-I
- Arg-I
called Arg-I
Concrete Arg-I
jungles Arg-I
have Arg-I
evolved Arg-I
endangering Arg-I
forests Arg-I
and Arg-I
wild Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
life Arg-B
saving Arg-I
oxygen Arg-I
is Arg-I
produced Arg-I
by Arg-I
trees Arg-I
after Arg-I
converting Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
gas Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
wild Arg-B
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
ecological Arg-I
balance Arg-I
on Arg-I
planet Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
large Arg-B
emissions Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
monoxide Arg-I
gas Arg-I
from Arg-I
refrigerants Arg-I
like Arg-I
air Arg-I
conditioners Arg-I
have Arg-I
depleted Arg-I
ozone Arg-I
layer Arg-I
. O

Importance Arg-B
of Arg-I
ozone Arg-I
layer Arg-I
is Arg-I
evident Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
as Arg-I
it Arg-I
protects Arg-I
us Arg-I
from Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
ultra Arg-I
violet Arg-I
rays Arg-I
. O

To O
add O
to O
it O
, O
excess Arg-B
emission Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
gas Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
by Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
has Arg-I
increased Arg-I
the Arg-I
average Arg-I
temperature Arg-I
at Arg-I
north Arg-I
pole Arg-I
which Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
has Arg-I
increased Arg-I
water Arg-I
level Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
gradual Arg-I
melting Arg-I
of Arg-I
glaciers Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
either Arg-B
industrial Arg-I
waste Arg-I
or Arg-I
domestic Arg-I
waste Arg-I
produced Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
is Arg-I
badly Arg-I
polluting Arg-I
the Arg-I
planet Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
unnoticed Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
waste Arg-I
released Arg-I
in Arg-I
oceans Arg-I
effects Arg-I
aquatic Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
extent Arg-I
. O

Harmful Arg-B
chemicals Arg-I
present Arg-I
in Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
waste Arg-I
kills Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
sea Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
in Arg-I
oceans Arg-I
or Arg-I
rivers Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
Earth Arg-B
is Arg-I
our Arg-I
home Arg-I

and Arg-I
it Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
protected Arg-I
. O

Any O
human O
activity O
causing O
harm O
to O
Earth O
should O
be O
controlled O
and O
alternate O
ways O
should O
be O
devised O
to O
control O
damage O
. O

Creative O
ideas O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
leave O
minimum O
environmental O
footprints O
without O
compromising O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

Amount O
of O
control O
on O
media O
information O

Nowadays O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
controversial O
issues O
related O
to O
mass O
media O
is O
the O
correct O
amount O
of O
control O
posed O
on O
newspapers O
, O
televisions O
and O
websites O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
the O
government O
should O
exercise O
less O
restriction O
on O
sharing O
of O
media O
information O
to O
public O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
control Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
against Arg-I
inappropriate Arg-I
contents Arg-I
and Arg-I
unsuitable Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
strong Arg-I
arguments Arg-I
in Arg-I
favour Arg-I
of Arg-I
tighter Arg-I
media Arg-I
control Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
limit Arg-I
the Arg-I
violent Arg-I
and Arg-I
sexual Arg-I
content Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
serious Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
puberty Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
an Arg-B
internet Arg-I
cartoon Arg-I
comedy Arg-I
called Arg-I
happy Arg-I
tree Arg-I
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
brutal Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
the Arg-I
characters Arg-I
usually Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
heads Arg-I
or Arg-I
limbs Arg-I
tear Arg-I
off Arg-I
. O

Another O
supporting O
reason O
is O
that O
television Arg-B
companies Arg-I
import Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
programmes Arg-I
from Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
audiences Arg-I
might Arg-I
accept Arg-I
their Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
which Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
not Arg-I
welcomed Arg-I
to Arg-I
local Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
few Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
there Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
Japanese Arg-I
game Arg-I
show Arg-I
which Arg-I
involved Arg-I
throwing Arg-I
cream Arg-I
cakes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
loser Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
actually Arg-I
very Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
unfriendly Arg-I
. O

The O
major O
opposing O
argument O
is O
to O
protect O
the O
safety O
of O
citizens O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
disclose Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
media Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
timely Arg-I
manner Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
for Arg-I
disasters Arg-I
and Arg-I
outbreak Arg-I
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Taking Arg-B
the Arg-I
SARS Arg-I
in Arg-I
2003 Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
government Arg-I
limited Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
for Arg-I
public Arg-I
access Arg-I
which Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
causes Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
deaths Arg-I
. O

Even O
so O
, O
another Arg-B
perspective Arg-I
on Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
the Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
from Arg-I
unnecessary Arg-I
fear Arg-I
and Arg-I
unrest Arg-I
. O

Both O
sides O
of O
the O
arguments O
have O
its O
merits O
. O

My O
personal O
view O
is O
that O
despite O
the O
emphasis O
of O
citizen O
safety O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
regulate Arg-I
the Arg-I
correct Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
violent Arg-I
and Arg-I
sexual Arg-I
content Arg-I
and Arg-I
censor Arg-I
the Arg-I
culturally Arg-I
unsuitable Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

Setting O
up O
a O
council O
to O
monitor O
the O
media O
information O
to O
the O
public O
could O
be O
a O
practical O
idea O
. O

Citizen O
's O
only O
responsibility O
is O
to O
pay O
taxes O

There O
is O
a O
controversial O
debate O
around O
the O
world O
about O
the O
duties O
of O
citizen O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
paying O
tax O
is O
the O
only O
responsibility O
of O
citizens O
, O
while O
others O
disagree O
and O
think O
that O
being O
a O
person O
in O
society O
involves O
more O
responsibilities O
. O

Taxes Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
income Arg-I
for Arg-I
every Arg-I
country Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
paying Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
means Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
taking Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
fulfilled Arg-I
their Arg-I
duty Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
individuals Arg-B
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
things Arg-I
apart Arg-I
from Arg-I
paying Arg-I
tax Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
must Arg-I
obey Arg-I
laws Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
were Arg-I
imposed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the Arg-B
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
is Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
and Arg-I
society Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
a Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
will Arg-I
develop Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
rapid Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
being Arg-B
a Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
should Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
history Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
history Arg-I
by Arg-I
studying Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
with Arg-I
full Arg-I
concentration Arg-I
or Arg-I
reading Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
books Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a Arg-B
person Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
unite Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
if Arg-B
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
strong Arg-I
bond Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
society Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
helping Arg-I
and Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Taking O
everything O
into O
account O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
being Arg-B
a Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
involves Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
duties Arg-I
, Arg-I
other Arg-I
than Arg-I
paying Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
must Arg-I
do Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
paying Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Testing O
on O
animals O
and O
keeping O
them O
in O
unnatural O
conditions O
Perhaps O
the O
most O
serious O
problem O
facing O
the O
animals O
' O
rights O
today O
is O
animal O
experimentation O
. O

Many O
medical O
treatments O
have O
been O
discovered O
by O
animal O
testing O
, O
including O
cancer O
and O
HIV O
drugs O
While O
most O
scientists O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
vital O
for O
improving O
human O
health O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
primates Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
rights Arg-I
as Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
several Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
why Arg-I
animal Arg-I
testing Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
banned Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
costs Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
year Arg-I
, Arg-I
cosmetic Arg-I
companies Arg-I
, Arg-I
farms Arg-I
or Arg-I
medical Arg-I
schools Arg-I
kill Arg-I
millions Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
to Arg-I
test Arg-I
their Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
result Arg-I
. O

Animal Arg-B
testing Arg-I
costs Arg-I
an Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
, O
since O
they Arg-B
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
fed Arg-I
, Arg-I
cared Arg-I
for Arg-I
and Arg-I
treated Arg-I
with Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
or Arg-I
experimental Arg-I
substances Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
animals Arg-B
are Arg-I
kept Arg-I
in Arg-I
unnatural Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
. O

Recent Arg-B
studies Arg-I
point Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
neglected Arg-I
and Arg-I
treated Arg-I
poorly Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
influences Arg-I
their Arg-I
reactions Arg-I
to Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
March Arg-I
2003 Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
lab Arg-I
technician Arg-I
shot Arg-I
a Arg-I
video Arg-I
inside Arg-I
a Arg-I
lab Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
revealed Arg-I
primates Arg-I
in Arg-I
cages Arg-I
without Arg-I
pain Arg-I
medication Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
one Arg-I
baboon Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
metal Arg-I
cylinder Arg-I
screwed Arg-I
into Arg-I
its Arg-I
head Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
I O
think O
that O
sacrificing Arg-B
animals Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
and Arg-I
painful Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

There O
is O
also O
the O
argument O
that O
many O
ethical O
and O
genetic O
principles O
are O
broken O
when O
testing O
on O
animals O
. O

Many O
people O
agree O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
inhumane Arg-I
and Arg-I
cruel Arg-I
to Arg-I
cause Arg-I
pain Arg-I
to Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
, O
since O
animals Arg-B
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
response Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
drug Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
human Arg-B
beings Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
moral Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
ways Arg-I
that Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
the Arg-I
individual Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O
it Arg-B
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
testing Arg-I
on Arg-I
animals Arg-I
has Arg-I
no Arg-I
clear Arg-I
result Arg-I
and O
consequently O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
illegal Arg-I
. O

Examination O
Examinations O
are O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
methods O
of O
measuring O
learning O
in O
education O
systems O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O

At O
virtually O
every O
stage O
of O
the O

process O
, O

are O
used O
to O

that O
the O

However O
, O
many O
believe O
that O
the O

should O
be O
reconsidered O

There Arg-B

clearly Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
to Arg-I

They Arg-B

the Arg-I

on Arg-I
all Arg-I

They Arg-B
are Arg-I

In O

some Arg-B

not Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
a Arg-I
satisfying Arg-I
result Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I

. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
teachers Arg-B
and Arg-I
learners Arg-I
focus Arg-I
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
theses Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
curriculum Arg-I
that Arg-I

thus Arg-I
narrowing Arg-I
the Arg-I
educational Arg-I
experience Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I

A Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I

be Arg-I
taken Arg-I

these Arg-I

. O

Wherever O
possible O

exams Arg-B

the Arg-I
content Arg-I

activities Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I

. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
exams Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
role Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
in Arg-I
ensuring Arg-I
proper Arg-I
and Arg-I
objective Arg-I
assessment Arg-I
of Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
exams Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
carefully Arg-I
designed Arg-I
and Arg-I
supplemented Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
evaluation Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
truly Arg-I
useful Arg-I
component Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Richer O
nations O
should O
help O
poorer O
nations O
in O
health O
, O
education O
and O
trade O
Improvements O
in O
health O
, O
education O
and O
trade O
are O
essential O
for O
the O
development O
of O
poorer O
nations O
. O

Poorer Arg-B
nations Arg-I
need Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
richer Arg-I
nations Arg-I
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
areas Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
area Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
nations Arg-I
normally Arg-I
have Arg-I
less Arg-I
quantity Arg-I
of Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
and Arg-I
nurses Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
richer Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

High Arg-B
population Arg-I
in Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
family Arg-I
planning Arg-I
caused Arg-I
the Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
unbalance Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
quantity Arg-I
of Arg-I
resident Arg-I
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
poorer Arg-B
nations Arg-I
are Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
to Arg-I
fulfill Arg-I
the Arg-I
demand Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

To O
solve O
these O
issues O
, O
richer Arg-B
nations Arg-I
can Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
by Arg-I
delegating Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
and Arg-I
nurses Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
power Arg-I
nations Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
donate Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
area Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
generally Arg-I
agreed Arg-I
that Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
often Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
in Arg-I
schools Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
lecturers Arg-I
in Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
education Arg-B
for Arg-I
these Arg-I
countries Arg-I
normally Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
free Arg-I
so Arg-I
only Arg-I
certain Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
afford Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

In O
order O
to O
solve O
the O
education O
manpower O
problem O
, O
richer Arg-B
countries Arg-I
can Arg-I
allocate Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
educators Arg-I
to Arg-I
train Arg-I
more Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
lecturers Arg-I
in Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
for Arg-B
the Arg-I
issue Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
fee Arg-I
, Arg-I
richer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
should Arg-I
offer Arg-I
scholarships Arg-I
and Arg-I
loan Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
area Arg-I
of Arg-I
trade Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
deny Arg-I
that Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
are Arg-I
lagging Arg-I
behind Arg-I
richer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Trading Arg-B
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
active Arg-I
in Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
may Arg-I
also Arg-I
be Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
incomplete Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
residents Arg-B
in Arg-I
rural Arg-I
areas Arg-I
still Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
farm Arg-I
for Arg-I
food Arg-I
production Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
token O
of O
goodwill O
, O
richer Arg-B
nations Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
financial Arg-I
service Arg-I
to Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
countries Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
trading Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
former Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
give Arg-I
consultation Arg-I
on Arg-I
setting Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
complete Arg-I
and Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
trading Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
richer Arg-B
nations Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
more Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
helping Arg-I
the Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
nations Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
trade Arg-I
. O

Improvements Arg-B
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
areas Arg-I
will Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
life Arg-I
for Arg-I
residents Arg-I
in Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
nations Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
to Arg-I
grow Arg-I
their Arg-I
homeland Arg-I
. O

There O
will O
be O
soon O
no O
role O
for O
teachers O
in O
classrooms O

In O
recent O
years O
it O
has O
become O
more O
common O
for O
teachers O
to O
use O
technological O
tools O
in O
the O
learning O
process O
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
agree Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
explosion Arg-I
in Arg-I
technology Arg-I
will Arg-I
' Arg-I
innovate Arg-I
' Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
replacing Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
with Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
teachers O
will O
never O
be O
replaced O
by O
computers O
. O

Firstly O
, O
computers Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
operated Arg-I
by Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

No Arg-B
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
argue Arg-I
that Arg-I
technological Arg-I
tools Arg-I
are Arg-I
must Arg-I
- Arg-I
haves Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
of Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
lessons Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
put Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
Power Arg-I
Point Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
presented Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
LCD Arg-I
Projector Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
scientists Arg-B
prove Arg-I
that Arg-I
every Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
needs Arg-I
trained Arg-I
staff Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
these Arg-I
interactive Arg-I
and Arg-I
innovative Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
that O
nowadays O
the O
learning O
process O
benefits O
greatly O
from O
computers O
, O
but O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
just Arg-I
tools Arg-I
for Arg-I
teachers Arg-I

and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
work Arg-I
properly Arg-I
without Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
touch Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
children Arg-B
need Arg-I
human Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
. O

No Arg-B
matter Arg-I
how Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
technology Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
computer Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
its Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
a Arg-I
recent Arg-I
interview Arg-I
with Arg-I
Josh Arg-I
Trumm Arg-I
– Arg-I
the Arg-I
founder Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
' Arg-I
Teachers Arg-I
Global Arg-I
Group'- Arg-I
reveals Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
imitated Arg-I
by Arg-I
computers Arg-I
: Arg-I
' Arg-I
This Arg-I
verbal Arg-I
and Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
verbal Arg-I
communication Arg-I
between Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
children Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
step Arg-I
towards Arg-I
a Arg-I
proper Arg-I
education O
. O

Without Arg-B
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
explain Arg-I
and Arg-I
understand Arg-I
their Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
actually Arg-I
learn Arg-I
' Arg-I
. O

I O
am O
inclined O
to O
agree O
with O
this O
scientific O
view O
, O
because O
only Arg-B
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
can Arg-I
feel Arg-I
and Arg-I
connect Arg-I
with Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
, Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
model Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
school Arg-I
without Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
that O
computers Arg-B
will Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
by Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
take Arg-I
their Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
conseilieurs Arg-I
. O

Advanced O
fertilizers O
and O
machine O
for O
farmers O
, O
good O
or O
bad O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
discussion O
about O
the O
agriculture O
development O
has O
become O
a O
controversy O
. O

While O
some O
appear O
to O
believe O
that O
advanced O
plant O
foods O
incorporate O
with O
newly O
developed O
devices O
significantly O
reduce O
the O
cost O
of O
producing O
farm O
products O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
this O
collaboration O
exerts O
a O
series O
of O
negative O
effects O
to O
people O
's O
health O
condition O
and O
the O
society O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
applying Arg-B
the Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
fertilizers Arg-I
in Arg-I
combine Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
automatic Arg-I
reaping Arg-I
resources Arg-I
increase Arg-I
farmers Arg-I
' Arg-I
economic Arg-I
profit Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
artificial Arg-B
fertilizers Arg-I
catalyze Arg-I
the Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
inch Arg-I
of Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
churn Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
crops Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
automatic Arg-I
machinery Arg-I
enhances Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
harvest Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
production Arg-I
and Arg-I
labour Arg-I
cost Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
kilogram Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
products Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
decreased Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
high Arg-B
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
fertilizers Arg-I
pose Arg-I
a Arg-I
potential Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
' Arg-I
health Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
the Arg-I
organic Arg-I
plant Arg-I
foods Arg-I
, Arg-I
industrialized Arg-I
fertilizers Arg-I
are Arg-I
made Arg-I
of Arg-I
unusual Arg-I
chemicals Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
varying Arg-I
the Arg-I
gene Arg-I
of Arg-I
crops Arg-I
into Arg-I
those Arg-I
unknown Arg-I
substances Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
remaining Arg-I
inside Arg-I
of Arg-I
plants Arg-I
permanently Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
consumers Arg-B
who Arg-I
intake Arg-I
those Arg-I
fertilized Arg-I
products Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
regular Arg-I
base Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
a Arg-I
series Arg-I
of Arg-I
disease Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
excessively Arg-B
relying Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
for Arg-I
harvest Arg-I
causes Arg-I
several Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
worsens Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
by Arg-I
releasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
exhaust Arg-I
emission Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
manual Arg-B
harvest Arg-I
prevents Arg-I
severe Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
damages Arg-I
. O

For O
another O
, O
mechanical Arg-B
reaper Arg-I
causes Arg-I
the Arg-I
rise Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
farming Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, O
possibly O
because O
high Arg-B
- Arg-I
end Arg-I
reaping Arg-I
plants Arg-I
replace Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
workers Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
even O
though O
newly Arg-B
developed Arg-I
plant Arg-I
foods Arg-I
and Arg-I
machinery Arg-I
make Arg-I
significant Arg-I
financial Arg-I
success Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
farmers Arg-I
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
the Arg-B
demerits Arg-I
of Arg-I
applying Arg-I
these Arg-I
new Arg-I
developments Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
industry Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
overlooked Arg-I
. O

Funding O
artists O

Nowadays O
, O
in O
order O
to O
save O
as O
much O
budget O
as O
possible O
and O
improve O
the O
economy O
of O
the O
country O
, O
every O
government O
around O
the O
world O
is O
seeking O
for O
some O
ways O
to O
spend O
wisely O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
suggestion O
that O
governments O
should O
not O
continue O
to O
fund O
the O
artists O
, O
but O
they O
ought O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
other O
necessary O
subjects O
such O
as O
medical O
research O
and O
space O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
firmly O
disagree O
with O
this O
recommendation O
due O
to O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
believe O
artists O
should O
be O
funded O
is O
because O
art Arg-B
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
attracting Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
monuments Arg-B
that Arg-I
represent Arg-I
each Arg-I
city Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
illustrate Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
's Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
more Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
and Arg-I
an Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some Arg-B
countries Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
main Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
revenue Arg-I
, O
thus O
, O
the Arg-B
governments Arg-I
should Arg-I
help Arg-I
arts Arg-I
because O
their Arg-B
work Arg-I
crafts Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
boost Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
sculptures Arg-B
and Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
galleries Arg-I
generally Arg-I
reflect Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
every Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
culture Arg-B
and Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
reserved Arg-I
and Arg-I
assured Arg-I
by Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

Young Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
by Arg-I
observing Arg-I
various Arg-I
work Arg-I
crafts Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
why O
artists O
should O
be O
helped O
is O
because O
talent Arg-B
in Arg-I
art Arg-I
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
precious Arg-I
and Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
not Arg-B
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
blessed Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
talent Arg-I
of Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
crafts Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
this Arg-B
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
talent Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
valued Arg-I
as Arg-I
other Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
talents Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
talent Arg-I
in Arg-I
science Arg-I
or Arg-I
literature Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
art Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
object Arg-I
for Arg-I
every Arg-I
country Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
talent Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
area Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
discovered Arg-I
everywhere Arg-I
, O
so O
I O
think O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
help Arg-I
and Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
artists Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Whether O
athletes O
and O
singers O
are O
overpaid O
? O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
are O
paid O
reasonable O
salaries O
, O
which O
can O
be O
up O
to O
millions O
of O
dollars O
each O
year O
. O

However O
, O
that O
is O
not O
equal O
to O
their O
actual O
contributions O
to O
the O
society O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
their Arg-B
salary Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
lower Arg-I
level Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
peoples Arg-I
in Arg-I
scientific Arg-I
or Arg-I
social Arg-I
, Arg-I
economic Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
some O
people O
claim O
that O
athletes Arg-B
and Arg-I
singers Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
their Arg-I
current Arg-I
salary Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
exceptional Arg-I
ability Arg-I
that Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
hardly Arg-B
anyone Arg-I
could Arg-I
play Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
as Arg-I
skillfully Arg-I
as Arg-I
Michael Arg-I
Jordan Arg-I
- Arg-I
a Arg-I
legendary Arg-I
former Arg-I
American Arg-I
player Arg-I
who Arg-I
won Arg-I
several Arg-I
times Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
NBA Arg-I
championship Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
also Arg-I
point Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
undergo Arg-I
painstaking Arg-I
and Arg-I
industrious Arg-I
training Arg-I
, Arg-I
let Arg-I
alone Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
contests Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
recognized Arg-I
and Arg-I
prove Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
singers Arg-I
and Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
, Arg-I
few Arg-I
of Arg-I
whom Arg-I
could Arg-I
rise Arg-I
to Arg-I
fame Arg-I
and Arg-I
victory Arg-I
ultimately Arg-I
. O

Overcoming Arg-B
all Arg-I
these Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
paid Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
extraordinary Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
their O
talents O
should O
not O
be O
overrated O
. O

Other O
people O
say O
that O
singers Arg-B
and Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
fact Arg-I
, Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
insignificantly Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
assumed Arg-I
the Arg-I
amazing Arg-I
performances Arg-I
they Arg-I
give Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
audiences Arg-I
are Arg-I
only Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
in Arg-I
aesthetic Arg-I
and Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
terms Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
scientists Arg-I
invent Arg-I
machines Arg-I
serving Arg-I
daily Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
and Arg-I
cure Arg-I
their Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
and Arg-I
policemen Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
the Arg-I
safety Arg-I
and Arg-I
stability Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
nation Arg-I
, Arg-I
singers Arg-I
and Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
improving Arg-I
the Arg-I
material Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
commit Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
to Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
relaxation Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoyment Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
audience Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
their Arg-B
contribution Arg-I
is Arg-I
less Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
those Arg-I
from Arg-I
doctors Arg-I
or Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
, Arg-I
albeit Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
their Arg-B
privilege Arg-I
of Arg-I
salary Arg-I
seems Arg-I
groundless Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
work Arg-I
forces Arg-I
receive Arg-I
modest Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
which Arg-I
only Arg-I
enable Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
afford Arg-I
bare Arg-I
necessities Arg-I
. O

From O
all O
analysis O
suggested O
above O
, O
professional Arg-B
athletes Arg-I
and Arg-I
singers Arg-I
are Arg-I
overpaid Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
contributions Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
modification O
in O
the O
salary O
of O
professional O
singers O
and O
athletes O
to O
balance O
with O
those O
of O
people O
in O
other O
fields O
, O
namely O
science O
and O
society O
, O
who O
are O
the O
driving O
forces O
for O
the O
prosperity O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

Capital O
punishment O
is O
necessary O
or O
not O
? O

Capital O
punishment O
is O
a O
controversial O
debate O
in O
many O
countries O
. O

In O
a O
world O
where O
brutal O
crimes O
need O
to O
be O
deterred O
, O
it O
may O
be O
true O
that O
the O
death O
penalty O
is O
an O
efficient O
retribution O
to O
admonish O
the O
violence O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
society O
grows O
, O
human O
rights O
become O
more O
highly O
respected O
, O
" Arg-B
murdering Arg-I
" Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
is Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
immoral Arg-I
and Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
accept Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
recognized O
that O
every Arg-B
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
no Arg-I
authority Arg-I
is Arg-I
empowered Arg-I
to Arg-I
deprive Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Although O
what Arg-B
criminals Arg-I
cause Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
specifically Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
victims Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
offensive Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
humans Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
valued Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
execution Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
resolve Arg-I
the Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
, O
not O
to O
mention O
it Arg-B
could Arg-I
put Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
's Arg-I
family Arg-I
through Arg-I
hardship Arg-I
while Arg-I
the Arg-I
pain Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
victim Arg-I
's Arg-I
kin Arg-I
is Arg-I
never Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
consoled Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
option Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
, Arg-I
life Arg-I
imprisonment Arg-I
is Arg-I
just Arg-I
as Arg-I
effective Arg-I
by Arg-I
detaining Arg-I
the Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
in Arg-I
prison Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
rest Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
in Arg-B
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
, Arg-I
living Arg-I
a Arg-I
miserable Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
restriction Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
outside Arg-I
and Arg-I
sustaining Arg-I
the Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
of Arg-I
guilt Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dark Arg-I
bounded Arg-I
room Arg-I
are Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
obsessing Arg-I
than Arg-I
being Arg-I
killed Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
third Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
the Arg-I
death Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
banned Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
that Arg-I
innocent Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
wrongly Arg-I
convicted Arg-I
. O

Juries Arg-B
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
humans Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
discretion Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
executed Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
crime Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
commit Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
question Arg-I
of Arg-I
fairness Arg-I
in Arg-I
judicial Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
presents Arg-I
an Arg-I
extreme Arg-I
warning Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
, O
I O
firmly O
object O
to O
it O
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
absurd Arg-I
and Arg-I
inhumane Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
life Arg-I
sentence Arg-I
. O

Businesses O
should O
be O
only O
concerned O
about O
making O
profits O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
companies O
, O
factories O
and O
businesses O
establish O
to O
provide O
products O
which O
are O
people O
's O
need O
and O
make O
a O
profit O
for O
their O
managers O
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
completely Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
profit Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
this Arg-I
permission Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
hit Arg-I
and Arg-I
damage Arg-I
everything Arg-I
for Arg-I
just Arg-I
making Arg-I
a Arg-I
profit Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
any Arg-I
control Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
permitted Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
everything Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
threaten Arg-I
the Arg-I
beings Arg-I
' Arg-I
life Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
human Arg-I
, Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
plants Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
we Arg-I
read Arg-I
and Arg-I
hear Arg-I
in Arg-I
televisions Arg-I
and Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
that Arg-I
some Arg-I
factories Arg-I
hit Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
by Arg-I
their Arg-I
toxic Arg-I
substances Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
if Arg-B
we Arg-I
let Arg-I
them Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
to Arg-I
just Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
profit Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
produce Arg-I
products Arg-I
with Arg-I
low Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
and Arg-I
high Arg-I
prices Arg-I
, O
therefore O
they Arg-B
might Arg-I
hit Arg-I
consumer Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
few Arg-I
months Arg-I
ago Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
broadcast Arg-I
from Arg-I
TV Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
which Arg-I
produced Arg-I
baby Arg-I
milk Arg-I
, Arg-I
sold Arg-I
milk Arg-I
which Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
quality Arg-I
and Arg-I

it Arg-I
caused Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
babies Arg-I
die Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
all Arg-B
companies Arg-I
, Arg-I
factories Arg-I
and Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
monitored Arg-I
by Arg-I
governments Arg-I
and Arg-I
executive Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
let Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
just Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
making Arg-I
profit Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
hit Arg-I
both Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
and Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

New O
high O
school O

Although O
some O
of O
my O
neighbors O
will O
oppose O
this O
idea O
, O
personally O
I O
approve O
it O
. O

The Arg-B
new Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
district Arg-I
is Arg-I
pretty Arg-I
old Arg-I
and Arg-I
lacks Arg-I
in Arg-I
necessities Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
get Arg-I
enough Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

I O
really O
believe O
that O
new Arg-B
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
addition Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
educational Arg-I
system Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
student Arg-I
concerned Arg-I
in Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Their Arg-B
old Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
is Arg-I
pretty Arg-I
old Arg-I
and Arg-I
need Arg-I
in Arg-I
new Arg-I
educational Arg-I
materials Arg-I
, Arg-I
repairing Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
sport Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Also O
the Arg-B
laboratory Arg-I
of Arg-I
physics Arg-I
and Arg-I
chemistry Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
bad Arg-I
condition Arg-I
, O
so O
the Arg-B
students Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
study Arg-I
well Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
study Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
breath Arg-I
and Arg-I
great Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
in Arg-I
new Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
new Arg-I
connections Arg-I
between Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
communities Arg-I
and Arg-I
districts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
classes Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
together Arg-I
in Arg-I
building Arg-I
of Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
during Arg-B
the Arg-I
football Arg-I
match Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
high Arg-I
schools Arg-I
will Arg-I
come Arg-I
and Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
competition Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
keep Arg-I
in Arg-I
touch Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
social Arg-I
connections Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
only Arg-I
disadvantage Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
noisiness Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
neighborhood Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
bit Arg-I
perturbed Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
a Arg-I
important Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
ceasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
this Arg-B
new Arg-I
construction Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
like Arg-I
new Arg-I
connections Arg-I
between Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
communities Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
educational Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
toward Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
only Arg-I
disadvantage Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
nosiness Arg-I
of Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
which Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
participate Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
deal Arg-I
. O

So O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
addition Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Parents O
or O
other O
adult O
relatives O
should O
make O
important O
decisions O
for O
their O
olde O

It O
might O
seem O
that O
teenaged O
children O
particularly O
in O
age O
of O
15 O
- O
18 O
are O
fully O
grown O
, O
so O
they O
do O
not O
need O
any O
help O
for O
making O
important O
decisions O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
teenagers Arg-B
need Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
higher Arg-I
ages Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
discuss O
my O
view O
in O
two O
main O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
parents Arg-B
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
adult Arg-I
relatives Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
towards Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
therefore O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
advisor Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
stuffs Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
so O
if Arg-B
children Arg-I
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
advices Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
happening Arg-I
worst Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
value Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
they Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
parents Arg-B
and Arg-I
adults Arg-I
relatives Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
consular Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
, O
because O
unfortunately Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
who Arg-I
cheat Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
for Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
more Arg-I
power Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
cheat Arg-I
young Arg-I
ages Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
believe Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
immature Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
trap Arg-I
them Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
makes O
no O
difference O
, O
people O
from O
young O
ages O
to O
old O
ages O
are O
free O
to O
make O
a O
decision O
, O
nonetheless O
sometimes O
to O
prevent O
some O
problems O
coming O
up O
for O
young O
individuals O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
adult Arg-I
relatives Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
piece Arg-I
of Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

Children O
are O
free O
You O
hardly O
ever O
can O
find O
a O
person O
who O
says O
that O
he O
or O
she O
had O
unpleasant O
childhood O
. O

When O
individuals O
reminisce O
their O
memories O
they O
absolutely O
infer O
to O
some O
of O
their O
childhood O
events O
. O

As O
much O
as O
their O
events O
might O
were O
bitter O
, O
in O
their O
adulthood O
they O
are O
sweet O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
two Arg-I
main Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
children Arg-B
are Arg-I
free Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
limitation Arg-I
are Arg-I
really Arg-I
rare Arg-I
. O

Because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
age Arg-I
of Arg-I
growth Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
to Arg-I
experience Arg-I
new Arg-I
stuffs Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
argument Arg-I
and Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
age Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
expected Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
educate Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
hand Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
this Arg-I
stage Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I Arg-B
made Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
almost Arg-I
traveled Arg-I
to Arg-I
all Arg-I
cities Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
county Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
kindergarten Arg-I
. O

Also O
I Arg-B
got Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
different Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
plants Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
maintain O
that O
the Arg-B
best Arg-I
phase Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
their Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
confine Arg-I
or Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
free Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
hands Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Concentrate O
on O
the O
objectives O
- O
people O
attend O
schools O
for O
various O
reasons O

From O
many O
centuries O
ago O
, O
universities O
have O
been O
playing O
an O
important O
role O
in O
ones O
' O
life O
. O

Different O
people O
attend O
university O
for O
different O
point O
of O
views O
. O

In O
my O
perspective O
, O
the Arg-B
three Arg-I
most Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
are Arg-I
increased Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
career Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
and Arg-I
new Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
for Arg-B
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
ideal Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
. O

Truthfully O
, O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
academic Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
is Arg-I
provided Arg-I
with Arg-I
varieties Arg-I
and Arg-I
gigantic Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
trained Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
strengthen Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
through Arg-B
the Arg-I
instructions Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
sufficient Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
laboratory Arg-I
, Arg-I
library Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
capable Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
on Arg-I
every Arg-I
academic Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
a Arg-I
deep Arg-I
sight Arg-I
into Arg-I
what Arg-I
are Arg-I
they Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
studying O
in O
university O
means O
that O
you O
have O
totally O
turned O
into O
a O
different O
page O
of O
your O
life O
, O
which O
included O
many O
new O
experiences O
. O

The Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
individual Arg-I
who Arg-I
enroll Arg-I
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
are Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
school Arg-I
one Arg-I
person Arg-I
have Arg-I
studied Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
such Arg-I
fantastic Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
new Arg-I
and Arg-I
wide Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
any Arg-I
corner Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
nation Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my Arg-B
brother Arg-I
are Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
international Arg-I
university Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
mixed Arg-I
community Arg-I
include Arg-I
Vietnam Arg-I
, Arg-I
Brazil Arg-I
, Arg-I
Argentina Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
he Arg-I
told Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
excited Arg-I
for Arg-I
experiencing Arg-I
such Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
main Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
when Arg-I
attending Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
preparing Arg-B
for Arg-I
career Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
function Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
do Arg-I
homework Arg-I
, Arg-I
assignment Arg-I
and Arg-I
attend Arg-I
class Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
volunteer Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
internship Arg-I
and Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
outside Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
discover Arg-I
what Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
goals Arg-I
are Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
they Arg-B
know Arg-I
where Arg-I
and Arg-I
what Arg-I
to Arg-I
put Arg-I
high Arg-I
emphasis Arg-I
on Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
their Arg-I
objectives Arg-I
. O

In O
summation O
, O
people O
may O
attend O
university O
for O
various O
reasons O
. O

Some O
want O
to O
enjoy O
new O
experiences O
, O
some O
are O
going O
to O
prepare O
for O
their O
future O
career O
, O
while O
others O
are O
eager O
to O
develop O
their O
understanding O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
purposes O
could O
be O
various O
, O
everybody Arg-B
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
objectives Arg-I
and Arg-I
try Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
. O

People O
are O
put O
too O
much O
focus O
on O
making O
wealth O
and O
progress O
in O
technology O

The O
life O
today O
is O
totally O
different O
from O
half O
centuries O
before O
. O

Advances O
in O
technology O
do O
help O
humans O
to O
solve O
abundant O
of O
problems O
; O
however O
it O
also O
deprives O
of O
some O
things O
that O
we O
had O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
life Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
old Arg-I
days Arg-I
brings Arg-I
more Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
than Arg-I
today Arg-I
for Arg-I
several Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
life Arg-B
is Arg-I
simple Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
humans Arg-I
compete Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

Since O
world Arg-B
population Arg-I
getting Arg-I
higher Arg-I
, O
competition Arg-B
is Arg-I
getting Arg-I
fierce Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
handle Arg-I
your Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
someone Arg-I
will Arg-I
replace Arg-I
you Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
put Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
their Arg-I
living Arg-I
condition Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
lives Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
old Arg-I
days Arg-I
is Arg-I
easier Arg-I
than Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
the Arg-B
environment Arg-I
today Arg-I
is Arg-I
serious Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
. O

Looking Arg-B
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
windows Arg-I
, Arg-I
what Arg-I
I Arg-I
see Arg-I
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
sky Arg-I
, Arg-I
trees Arg-I
or Arg-I
mountains Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
is Arg-I
coldly Arg-I
high Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
. O

Everyday Arg-B
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
walk Arg-I
on Arg-I
hard Arg-I
roads Arg-I
, Arg-I
breath Arg-I
in Arg-I
polluted Arg-I
air Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
limited Arg-I
space Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
worse O
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
proved Arg-I
that Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
condition Arg-I
will Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
mental Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
environment Arg-I
our Arg-I
grandparents Arg-I
live Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
than Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
third Arg-I
reason Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Today Arg-B
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
the Arg-I
news Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
chat Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
by Arg-I
planes Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
it Arg-B
also Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
any Arg-I
thing Arg-I
happens Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
will Arg-I
affect Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
react Arg-I
properly Arg-I
and Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
vulnerable Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
choice Arg-I
but Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
fast Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
while O
there O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
pretty Arg-I
good Arg-I
condition Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
minority Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
are Arg-I
put Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
making Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
and Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
technology Arg-I
; O
nevertheless O
, O
behind O
the O
glamorous O
facade O
of O
it O
, O
what O
we O
loss O
will O
never O
be O
returned O
. O

Educated O
high O
- O
school O
students O
with O
bright O
and O
independent O
mind O
High O
school O
is O
the O
time O
when O
you O
decide O
your O
future O
career O
and O
particular O
field O
you O
want O
to O
concentrate O
and O
interested O
in O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
high Arg-B
school Arg-I
should Arg-I
permit Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
courses Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
for Arg-I
several Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
of Arg-I
choice Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
students Arg-I
grades Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
explore Arg-I
their Arg-I
aptitude Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as O
I O
mentioned O
above O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
allowing Arg-I
students Arg-I
their Arg-I
desired Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
chosen Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
restriction Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
rights Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
children Arg-I
of Arg-I
independent Arg-I
country Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
know Arg-I
our Arg-I
rights Arg-I
and Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
our Arg-I
goals Arg-I
and Arg-I
dreams Arg-I
. O

Next O
, O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
classes Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
and Arg-I
grades Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
among Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
and Arg-I
productive Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
instructor Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
taking Arg-I
art Arg-I
class Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
shared Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
interests Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Giving Arg-B
chance Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
interested Arg-I
fields Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
is Arg-I
merit Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
most O
important O
reason O
I O
support O
this O
idea O
is O
he Arg-B
or Arg-I

she Arg-I
can Arg-I
explore Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
area Arg-I

she Arg-I
/ Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
an Arg-I
aptitude Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
schools Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
such Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
and Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
lives Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
point Arg-I
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
get Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
this Arg-B
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
can Arg-I
raise Arg-I
future Arg-I
geniuses Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
as O
a O
young O
women O
I Arg-B
want Arg-I
my Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
desire Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
distinguished Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
so O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
but Arg-I
for Arg-I
society Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Having O
three O
reasons O
helps O
us O
to O
bring O
up O
students O
who O
are O
well O
- O
educated O
, O
with O
a O
bright O
and O
independent O
mind O
. O

Under O
suitable O
administration O
, O
tourism O
enhances O
local O
economic O
development O
Tourist O
trade O
is O
becoming O
a O
powerful O
engine O
for O
the O
economy O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
some O
individuals O
believe O
that O
this O
position O
ignores O
the O
ecological O
and O
environmental O
destruction O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
tourist O
activities O
, O
and O
its O
adverse O
effects O
on O
local O
communities O
and O
ecosystems O
. O

While O
both O
positions O
seem O
reasonable O
, O
my O
view O
is O
that O
, O
through Arg-B
proper Arg-I
management Arg-I
and Arg-I
regulation Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
booming Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
industry Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
and Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
for Arg-I
rural Arg-I
and Arg-I
urban Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
most Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
merit Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
can Arg-I
vastly Arg-I
boost Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
state Arg-I
or Arg-I
region Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
takes Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
through Arg-I
direct Arg-I
expenditure Arg-I
from Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
because Arg-I
it Arg-I
provides Arg-I
direct Arg-I
and Arg-I
indirect Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
retail Arg-I
, Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
service Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
increasing Arg-I
tax Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
expansion Arg-I
of Arg-I
local Arg-I
markets Arg-I
for Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
, Arg-I
luxury Arg-I
goods Arg-I
amongst Arg-I
others Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
solid Arg-I
, Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
regulated Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
tourism Arg-B
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
direct Arg-I
and Arg-I
indirect Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
retail Arg-I
, Arg-I
hotels Arg-I
, Arg-I
transport Arg-I
, Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
service Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
increase Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
allows Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
significant Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
society Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
purchasing Arg-I
of Arg-I
commodities Arg-I
by Arg-I
their Arg-I
growing Arg-I
incomes Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
this Arg-B
gives Arg-I
energy Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
cycle Arg-I
, Arg-I
generating Arg-I
local Arg-I
economic Arg-I
prosperity Arg-I
in Arg-I
return Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
oppose Arg-I
these Arg-I
, Arg-I
citing Arg-I
the Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
destruction Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
compared Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, Arg-I
other Arg-I
alternatives Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
resource Arg-I
extraction Arg-I
and Arg-I
manufacture Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
far Arg-I
worse Arg-I
destroyers Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
paper Arg-B
mills Arg-I
pour Arg-I
hundreds Arg-I
and Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
tons Arg-I
of Arg-I

rivers Arg-I
, Arg-I
causing Arg-I
severe Arg-I
water Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the Arg-B
dramatic Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
, Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
spending Arg-I
a Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
locating Arg-I
and Arg-I
visiting Arg-I
rustic Arg-I
villages Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
well Arg-I
educated Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
illogical Arg-I
to Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
rational Arg-I
folks Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
conduct Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
decently Arg-I
if Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
so Arg-I
. O

After O
careful O
consideration O
of O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
argument O
, O
the Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
sector Arg-I
is Arg-I
desirable Arg-I
for Arg-I
its Arg-I
important Arg-I
socioeconomic Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
evident Arg-I
that Arg-I
under Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
administration Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
. O

The O
government O
should O
allocate O
more O
funds O
to O
public O
services O
instead O
of O
arts O

The O
issue O
of O
governmental O
financing O
provision O
to O
aesthetic O
features O
in O
the O
society O
has O
sparked O
a O
heated O
debate O
. O

While O
some O
argue O
that O
the O
budget O
allocation O
to O
the O
arts O
is O
waste O
of O
national O
resources O
and O
the O
money O
should O
instead O
be O
spent O
on O
public O
services O
, O
I O
contend O
that O
this Arg-B
investment Arg-I
in Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
arts Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
interest Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
governments Arg-B
are Arg-I
liable Arg-I
for Arg-I
providing Arg-I
societies Arg-I
with Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
no Arg-B
one Arg-I
should Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
any Arg-I
sort Arg-I
of Arg-I
deficiency Arg-I
in Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
these Arg-B
could Arg-I
only Arg-I
help Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
physical Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
burden Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
highly Arg-I
concern Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
mental Arg-I
health Arg-I
initiatives Arg-I
which Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
unconsciously Arg-I
or Arg-I
sensibly Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
arts Arg-I
. O

On O
top O
of O
this O
, O
the Arg-B
arts Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
- Arg-I
round Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

No Arg-B
developed Arg-I
country Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
named Arg-I
that Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
painting Arg-I
, Arg-I
literature Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
fields Arg-I
of Arg-I
arts Arg-I
are Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
government Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
. O

Enriching Arg-B
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
enlightening Arg-I
their Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
arts Arg-I
basically Arg-I
affect Arg-I
the Arg-I
enhancement Arg-I
of Arg-I
societies Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
positive Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
investing Arg-B
in Arg-I
art Arg-I
could Arg-I
bring Arg-I
employment Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
and Arg-I
could Arg-I
end Arg-I
in Arg-I
return Arg-I
of Arg-I
capital Arg-I
occasionally Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
investment Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
paid Arg-I
back Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
values Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
created Arg-I
works Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
which Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
matter Arg-I
of Arg-I
fact Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
national Arg-I
possessions Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
not Arg-B
only Arg-I
could Arg-I
investing Arg-I
in Arg-I
art Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
money Arg-I
at Arg-I
any Arg-I
kind Arg-I
, O
but O
also O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
enriches Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
and Arg-I
governments Arg-I
and Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
would Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

People O
are O
now O
more O
conscious O
to O
gain O
more O
educational O
qualification O

The O
career O
itself O
became O
the O
motto O
of O
living O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
industrialization O
in O
the O
late O
19th O
century O
. O

People O
usually O
tend O
to O
have O
a O
single O
career O
as O
a O
means O
of O
living O
. O

However O
, O
a O
modern O
trend O
reveals O
that O
new O
generations O
are O
more O
interested O
to O
perform O
several O
jobs O
and O
also O
would O
like O
to O
gain O
multiple O
higher O
educational O
certificates O
in O
order O
to O
earn O
more O
and O
to O
gain O
financial O
security O
. O

A Arg-B
full Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
steady Arg-I
income Arg-I
was Arg-I
enough Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
potential Arg-I
employee Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
himself Arg-I
and Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

But O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
recent Arg-I
recession Arg-I
, Arg-I
almost Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
countries Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
are Arg-I
seeing Arg-I
significant Arg-I
economic Arg-I
downfall Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
overwhelming Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
is Arg-I
prompting Arg-I
delayering Arg-I
and Arg-I
reduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
workers Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
focusing Arg-I
on Arg-I
doing Arg-I
several Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
or Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
further Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
to Arg-I
secure Arg-I
their Arg-I
economic Arg-I
condition Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
arrival Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
also Arg-I
been Arg-I
playing Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
role Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
further Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
. O

The O
official O
term O
of O

named O

North Arg-B
American Arg-I
economists Arg-I
have Arg-I
published Arg-I
reports Arg-I
after Arg-I
scrutinizing Arg-I
the Arg-I
recent Arg-I
American Arg-I
economic Arg-I
situation Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
eliminating Arg-I
more Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
than Arg-I
creating Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
robots Arg-B
, Arg-I
automation Arg-I
and Arg-I
softwares Arg-I
are Arg-I
taking Arg-I
over Arg-I
manual Arg-I
human Arg-I
workers Arg-I
professions Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
clerks Arg-I
, Arg-I
interpreters Arg-I
, Arg-I
security Arg-I
services Arg-I
, Arg-I
retails Arg-I
and Arg-I
specially Arg-I
in Arg-I
manufacturing Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

Thus O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
at Arg-I
high Arg-I
stake Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
a Arg-I
flexible Arg-I
earning Arg-I
is Arg-I
getting Arg-I
more Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
corporational Arg-B
policy Arg-I
to Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
less Arg-I
to Arg-I
inferiors Arg-I
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
reason Arg-I
that Arg-I
drives Arg-I
labours Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
different Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
more Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
educational Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
various Arg-I
fields Arg-I
simultaneously Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
support Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
human O
activities O
are O
influenced O
by O
computer O
use O
Computer O
is O
a O
modern O
device O
that O
is O
useful O
for O
human O
life O
. O

People O
use O
computer O
particularly O
for O
work O
, O
study O
, O
even O
for O
communication O
. O

However O
, O
many O
people O
argue O
that O
computer O
more O
give O
obstacle O
than O
a O
help O
in O
social O
life O
. O

Other O
sides O
believe O
that O
it O
becomes O
prominent O
thing O
, O
and O
they O
can O
not O
do O
anything O
without O
that O
device O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
computer Arg-B
can Arg-I
influence Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
have Arg-I
already Arg-I
been Arg-I
controlled Arg-I
by Arg-I
device Arg-I
. O

I O
would O
argue O
that O
this Arg-B
modern Arg-I
device Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
hindrance Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
study Arg-I
conducted Arg-I
by Arg-I
Mediabank Arg-I
shows Arg-I
that Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
Australian Arg-I
adults Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they Arg-B
spend Arg-I
almost Arg-I
nine Arg-I
hours Arg-I
a Arg-I
day Arg-I
dealing Arg-I
with Arg-I
computers Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
produce Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

As O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
computers Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
help Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
neglected Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
using Arg-B
computer Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
complete Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Businessmen Arg-B
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
use Arg-I
computer Arg-I
device Arg-I
to Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
or Arg-I
communication Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
. O

Communication Arg-B
by Arg-I
feature Arg-I
- Arg-I
computer Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
internet Arg-I
help Arg-I
busy Arg-I
businessmen Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
relation Arg-I
even Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
using Arg-I
computer Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
workers Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
more Arg-I
in Arg-I
work Arg-I
without Arg-I
computer Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
in Arg-B
era Arg-I
technology Arg-I
like Arg-I
this Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
computer Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
important Arg-I
thing Arg-I
in Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Every O

, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
day Arg-I
without Arg-I
stay Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I

This Arg-B

Qualification O

the O

of O
an O

the O

The O
essay O

to O
explore O
both O
sides O
of O
arguments O

also O
present O
my O
own O
opinion O
. O

Firstly O
, O
some O
people O
suggest O
that O
qualification Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
foremost Arg-I
measurement Arg-I
to Arg-I
determine Arg-I
the Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
employer Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
importance Arg-I
that Arg-I
workers Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
well Arg-I
educated Arg-I
and Arg-I
trained Arg-I
to Arg-I
perform Arg-I
duties Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Specifically O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
professional Arg-I
fields Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
medicals Arg-I
are Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
degree Arg-I
and Arg-I
years Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

Social Arg-B
skills Arg-I
seem Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
important Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
success Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
surgery Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O

it O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the Arg-B
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
recognized Arg-I
by Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
employers Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
because O
people Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
are Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
frequently Arg-I
. O

Interpersonal Arg-B
skill Arg-I
plays Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
helping Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
when Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
arise Arg-I
. O

Better Arg-B
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
allow Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
resolve Arg-I
disagreements Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
harmony Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
organization Arg-B
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
transformed Arg-I
to Arg-I
customers Arg-I
oriented Arg-I
. O

Excellent Arg-B
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
employees Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
strong Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
clients Arg-I
which Arg-I
thus Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
customer Arg-I
satisfaction Arg-I
. O

To O
my O
view O
, O
I O
incline O
to O
believe O
qualification Arg-B
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
the Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
determinant Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
employee Arg-I
's Arg-I
competency Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Yet O
, O
the Arg-B
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
neglected Arg-I
as Arg-I
those Arg-I
skills Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
perform Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
and Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
by Arg-I
facilitating Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
and Arg-I
communication Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

International O
aid O

The O
world O
has O
become O
more O
prosperous O
than O
ever O
yet O
a O
great O
number O
of O
people O
are O
still O
living O
in O
poverty O
or O
suffering O
by O
wars O
or O
disasters O
. O

Charity O
organisations O
have O
been O
playing O
an O
important O
role O
to O
provide O
support O
to O
those O
people O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
controversial O
whether O
the O
help O
should O
go O
to O
the O
people O
who O
need O
it O
most O
or O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
country O
where O
the O
charity O
organisations O
are O
located O
. O

My O
view O
is O
that O
international Arg-B
aid Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
prioritised Arg-I
. O

International Arg-B
aid Arg-I
is Arg-I
critical Arg-I
because O
people Arg-B
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
facing Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
serious Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
African Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
living Arg-I
below Arg-I
the Arg-I
basic Arg-I
standards Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
lack Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
water Arg-I
or Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
which Arg-I
keep Arg-I
them Arg-I
warm Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
mention Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
is Arg-I
worse Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
countries Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
confronted Arg-I
with Arg-I
wars Arg-I
or Arg-I
natural Arg-I
disasters Arg-I
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
severe Arg-I
issues Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
security Arg-I
, Arg-I
homelessness Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
pain Arg-I
of Arg-I
losing Arg-I
best Arg-I
friends Arg-I
or Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
those Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
desperate Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
international Arg-I
support Arg-I
. O

Despite O
the O
importance O
of O
helping O
those O
beyond O
our O
national O
borders O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
to Arg-I
lend Arg-I
a Arg-I
hand Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
fellow Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
charity Arg-B
organisations Arg-I
are Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
funded Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I

thus O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
demand Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
spent Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
where Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
collected Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
, O
even Arg-B
within Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
developed Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
poor Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
lack Arg-I
their Arg-I
basic Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
solving Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
social Arg-I
stability Arg-I
and Arg-I
steady Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
people Arg-B
from Arg-I
unfortunate Arg-I
countries Arg-I
need Arg-I
more Arg-I
international Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
while Arg-I
helping Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
. O

Popular O
events O
are O
essential O

A O
world O
sportive O
competition O
event O
is O
watched O
by O
almost O
every O
country O
around O
the O
world O
and O
provide O
social O
stimulus O
and O
people O
gathering O
. O

However O
, O
while O
people O
view O
these O
sportive O
events O
as O
vital O
in O
release O
international O
problems O
, O
others O
think O
that O
they O
are O
just O
entertainment O
to O
distract O
people O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
somehow Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
not Arg-I
essential Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
world Arg-B
sport Arg-I
events Arg-I
provide Arg-I
positive Arg-I
waves Arg-I
for Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
main Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
such Arg-I
competitions Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
and Arg-I
share Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
between Arg-I
supporters Arg-I
though Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
emotions Arg-I
are Arg-I
shared Arg-I
locally Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
village Arg-I
or Arg-I
city Arg-I
, Arg-I
nationally Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
but Arg-I
even Arg-I
internationally Arg-I
too Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
these Arg-B
events Arg-I
gather Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
nationalist Arg-I
pride Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
is Arg-I
increased Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
football Arg-I
world Arg-I
cup Arg-I
taking Arg-I
place Arg-I
every Arg-I
four Arg-I
years Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
followed Arg-I
event Arg-I
during Arg-I
which Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
is Arg-I
having Arg-I
fun Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
sports Arg-I
events Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
essential Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
issues Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
politics Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
international Arg-I
affairs Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
general Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
show Arg-I
is Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
and Arg-I
fraternal Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
reality Arg-I
is Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
this O
is O
the O
" O
calm O
before O
the O
storm O
" O
. O

After Arg-B
the Arg-I
Olympics Arg-I
games Arg-I
are Arg-I
finished Arg-I
, Arg-I
everything Arg-I
came Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
normal Arg-I
and Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
competition Arg-I
is Arg-I
forgotten Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
. O

To O
picture O
it O
, O
recently Arg-B
, Arg-I
Putin Arg-I
was Arg-I
pleased Arg-I
to Arg-I
open Arg-I
the Arg-I
last Arg-I
winter Arg-I
Olympic Arg-I
games Arg-I
and Arg-I
gather Arg-I
international Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
actually Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
just Arg-I
facade Arg-I
and Arg-I
Putin Arg-I
did Arg-I
n't Arg-I
listen Arg-I
international Arg-I
warning Arg-I
after Arg-I
he Arg-I
conquered Arg-I
the Arg-I
Crimea Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
an Arg-B
international Arg-I
sports Arg-I
event Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
good Arg-I
thing Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
let Arg-I
them Arg-I
dream Arg-I
, Arg-I
being Arg-I
proud Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
nationality Arg-I
and Arg-I
forget Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
just Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
while Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
meetings Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
none Arg-I
case Arg-I
here Arg-I
to Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
international Arg-I
affairs Arg-I
. O

Distance O
- O
learning O
can O
not O
bring O
the O
benefits O
that O
traditional O
colleges O
offer O

With O
the O
tremendous O
development O
in O
information O
technology O
, O
long O
- O
distance O
education O
enables O
people O
to O
study O
at O
home O
without O
going O
to O
school O
. O

Whether O
this O
teaching O
approach O
is O
more O
beneficial O
to O
pupils O
than O
the O
traditional O
way O
sparks O
off O
a O
heated O
debate O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
remote Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
studying Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
expense Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
who Arg-I
use Arg-I
distance Arg-I
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
programs Arg-I
can Arg-I
cut Arg-I
down Arg-I
their Arg-I
commuting Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
fees Arg-I
, Arg-I
textbook Arg-I
fees Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
just Arg-I
by Arg-I
an Arg-I
internet Arg-I
connection Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
especially Arg-I
makes Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
difference Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
far Arg-I
- Arg-I
off Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
whose Arg-I
families Arg-I
are Arg-I
living Arg-I
below Arg-I
the Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
- Arg-I
line Arg-I
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
long Arg-B
- Arg-I
distance Arg-I
education Arg-I
provides Arg-I
students Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
access Arg-I
the Arg-I
immense Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
resources Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
approaches Arg-I
. O

Pupils Arg-B
can Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
materials Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
curricula Arg-I
just Arg-I
by Arg-I
one Arg-I
mouse Arg-I
click Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
science Arg-I
reports Arg-I
, Arg-I
study Arg-I
posts Arg-I
, Arg-I
documentary Arg-I
records Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
student Arg-I
can Arg-I
even Arg-I
select Arg-I
a Arg-I
specific Arg-I
online Arg-I
course Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
his Arg-I
own Arg-I
preference Arg-I
and Arg-I
time Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
so O
he Arg-B
can Arg-I
control Arg-I
the Arg-I
learning Arg-I
progress Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
satisfactory Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
on Arg-I
this Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
traditional Arg-B
education Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
in Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
mental Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
educations Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
make Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
contributions Arg-I
in Arg-I
providing Arg-I
immediate Arg-I
feedbacks Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultivating Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
' Arg-I
personalities Arg-I
. O

But O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
improvements Arg-I
in Arg-I
streaming Arg-I
and Arg-I
sensor Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
, Arg-I
remote Arg-I
education Arg-I
can Arg-I
eliminate Arg-I
the Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
of Arg-I
distance Arg-I
and Arg-I
body Arg-I
contacts Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
concede O
that O
traditional Arg-B
education Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
merits Arg-I
like Arg-I
feedbacks Arg-I
and Arg-I
inspirations Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
near Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
distance Arg-B
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
outweighs Arg-I
the Arg-I
conventional Arg-I
way Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
with Arg-I
its Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
, Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
and Arg-I
economic Arg-I
value Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
regulated Arg-I
education Arg-I
that Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
. O

Every O
student O
either O
male O
or O
female O
should O
be O
given O
equal O
opportunity O

In O
today O
's O
context O
, O
education O
is O
the O
most O
significant O
factor O
which O
ultimately O
determines O
one O
's O
future O
. O

In O
my O
personal O
opinion O
, O
I O
am O
totally O
agreed O
with O
the O
view O
that O
there Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
any Arg-I
room Arg-I
for Arg-I
partiality Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
gender Arg-I
while Arg-I
allocating Arg-I
seats Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
university Arg-I
courses Arg-I
. O

There O
appear O
to O
be O
various O
reasons O
often O
strike O
in O
my O
mind O
in O
support O
of O
this O
position O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
judging Arg-B
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
should Arg-I
only Arg-I
be Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
academic Arg-I
qualifications Arg-I
and Arg-I
talents Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
gender Arg-I
in Arg-I
particular Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
, O
both Arg-B
male Arg-I
and Arg-I
female Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
equally Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
and Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
to Arg-I
produce Arg-I
impressive Arg-I
results Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
India Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
female Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
often Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
grab Arg-I
more Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
top Arg-I
scorer Arg-I
positions Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
year Arg-I
higher Arg-I
secondary Arg-I
school Arg-I
examinations Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
female Arg-B
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
highly Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
courses Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
mechanical Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
which Arg-I
demands Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
lab Arg-I
workshops Arg-I
, Arg-I
unlike Arg-I
previous Arg-I
generation Arg-I
females Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
due Arg-B
to Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
exposure Arg-I
on Arg-I
current Arg-I
affairs Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
cutting Arg-I
- Arg-I
edge Arg-I
technological Arg-I
developments Arg-I
, Arg-I
female Arg-I
graduates Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
huge Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
, Arg-I
despite Arg-I
its Arg-I
intensive Arg-I
stress Arg-I
and Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Chanda Arg-B
Kochhar Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
CEO Arg-I
of Arg-I
India Arg-I
's Arg-I
second Arg-I
largest Arg-I
bank Arg-I
called Arg-I
ICICI Arg-I
bank Arg-I
and Arg-I
prominently Arg-I
awarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
most Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
female Arg-I
head Arg-I
in Arg-I
business Arg-I
sector Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
am O
firmly O
supporting O
the O
view O
, O
that O
every Arg-B
student Arg-I
either Arg-I
male Arg-I
or Arg-I
female Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
fairly Arg-I
equal Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
purse Arg-I
their Arg-I
education Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
university Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, Arg-I
provided Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
required Arg-I
qualifications Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
putting Arg-I
limitations Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
gender Arg-I
. O

Government O
should O
take O
interim O
measures O
, O
to O
regulate O
admission O
process O
for O
university O
courses O
which O
enables O
every O
student O
to O
get O
benefit O
. O

More O
convincing O
There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
communication O
is O
better O
than O
other O
kinds O
of O
communication O
, O
and O
this O
topic O
can O
also O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
believe O
that O
communication O
in O
person O
is O
the O
best O
way O
of O
expression O
, O
while O
others O
seem O
to O
stand O
on O
the O
opposite O
position O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
also O
develop O
my O

I Arg-B
agree Arg-I
that Arg-I
face Arg-I

to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
communicating Arg-B
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
convincing Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
, Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
convince Arg-I
or Arg-I
complain Arg-I
someone Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
fitting Arg-I
example Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
found Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
uncle Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
once Arg-I
complained Arg-I
a Arg-I
service Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
exaggeration Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
directly Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
boss Arg-I
and Arg-I
told Arg-I
the Arg-I
boss Arg-I
that Arg-I
something Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
occurred Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
meal Arg-I
-- Arg-I
a Arg-I
fly Arg-I
concealed Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Afterward Arg-B
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
uncle Arg-I
acquired Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
service Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
he Arg-I
just Arg-I
wrote Arg-I
something Arg-I
to Arg-I
complain Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
website Arg-I
or Arg-I
by Arg-I
telephone Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
think Arg-I
this Arg-I
problem Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
thought Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
commence Arg-I
to Arg-I
agree Arg-I
that Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
someone Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
another O
equally O
crucible O
aspect O
is O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
deceived Arg-I
without Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
had Arg-I
received Arg-I
some Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
words Arg-I
on Arg-I
facebook Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
best Arg-I
friend Arg-I
, Arg-I
Eric Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
said Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
totally Arg-I
failed Arg-I
in Arg-I
building Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
friendship Arg-I

and Arg-I
he Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
anymore Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
just Arg-I
shocked Arg-I
and Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
happened Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
I Arg-B
realized Arg-I
that Arg-I
his Arg-I
facebook Arg-I
account Arg-I
was Arg-I
stolen Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we Arg-B
are Arg-I
capable Arg-I
of Arg-I
stating Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
dissidents O
proclaiming O
that O
communication Arg-B
by Arg-I
letters Arg-I
, Arg-I
email Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
telephone Arg-I
can Arg-I
enable Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
without Arg-I
scruple Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
parts Arg-I
in Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
limited O
understanding O
, O
I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
conceivable Arg-I
that Arg-I
before Arg-I
we Arg-I
talk Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
imprudent Arg-I
about Arg-I
our Arg-I
words Arg-I
. O

Talking Arg-B
without Arg-I
scruple Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
communication Arg-I
; Arg-I
in Arg-I
contrast Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
usually Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
to Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrated O
above O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
my Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
are Arg-I
qualitatively Arg-I
greater Arg-I
than Arg-I
that Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
opposite Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I O
think O
the Arg-B
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
is Arg-I
by Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I

Still O

Successful O
people O
do O
something O
new O

take O
risks O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
successful O
people O
usually O
take O
risk O
or O
try O
new O
things O
, O
and O
the O
topic O
can O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
believe O
that O
to O
be O
successful O
, O
they O
should O
do O
something O
they O
are O
unfamiliar O
with O
, O
while O
others O
seem O
to O
stand O
on O
the O
opposite O
place O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
develop O
my O
own O
perspective O
as O
well O
. O

I O
favor O
the O
latter O
; O
that O
is O
, O
successful Arg-B
people Arg-I
still Arg-I
do Arg-I
things Arg-I
they Arg-I
already Arg-I
know Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
an O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
to Arg-B
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
all Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
risk Arg-I
we Arg-I
might Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
lower Arg-I
the Arg-I
factors Arg-I
making Arg-I
us Arg-I
fail Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
higher Arg-I
probability Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
we Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

Consider Arg-B
a Arg-I
circumstance Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
one Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
rich Arg-I
because Arg-I
he Arg-I
knows Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
investment Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
can Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
certain Arg-I
companies Arg-I
which Arg-I
he Arg-I
thinks Arg-I
is Arg-I
worth Arg-I
it Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
just Arg-I
waits Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
not Arg-I
so Arg-I
high Arg-I
but Arg-I
constant Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
some Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
companies Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
higher Arg-I
profit Arg-I
which Arg-I
might Arg-I
lead Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
bankrupt Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
commence O
to O
agree O
that O
successful Arg-B
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
or Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
another O
equally O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
that O
it Arg-B
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
capability Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
decide Arg-I
whether Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

At O
least O
, O
a Arg-B
successful Arg-I
person Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
dismantle Arg-I
the Arg-I
hurdles Arg-I
prohibiting Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
sports Arg-I
stars Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
some Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
to Arg-I
win Arg-I
a Arg-I
game Arg-I
or Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
extraordinary Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
same Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
they Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
all Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
predominated Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
sports Arg-I
realm Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
those Arg-B
athletes Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
distinctive Arg-I
performance Arg-I
by Arg-I
taking Arg-I
risks Arg-I
of Arg-I
taking Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
are Arg-I
failed Arg-I
to Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
it Arg-B

something Arg-I

because O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
become Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
widely Arg-I
accepted Arg-I
idea Arg-I
for Arg-I

However O

Try Arg-B
something Arg-I

can Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
become Arg-I
special Arg-I
, O
while Arg-B
it Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
mean Arg-I
successful Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrated O
above O

I O
believe O
that O
doing Arg-B
what Arg-I
we Arg-I
already Arg-I
known Arg-I

still Arg-I

us Arg-I

In O
other O

reducing O

University O
education O
should O
be O
only O
available O
for O
good O
students O

The O
purpose O
of O
education O
is O
always O
a O
controversial O
topic O
among O
people O
and O
society O
, O
especially O
in O
high O
level O
such O
as O
college O
or O
university O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
all O
students O
should O
deserve O
to O
be O
educated O
at O
this O
level O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
this Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
training Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
good Arg-I
, Arg-I
knowledgeable Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
focusing Arg-B
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
talented Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
option Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
academic Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
education Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
middle Arg-I
school Arg-I
or Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
university Arg-I
and Arg-I
college Arg-I
require Arg-I
far Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
ability Arg-I
and Arg-I
skills Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
an Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
complex Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some Arg-B
students Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
capable Arg-I
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
the Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
of Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
tough Arg-I
even Arg-I
for Arg-I
talented Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
explains Arg-I
why Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
limited Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
opening Arg-I
up Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
fatal Arg-I
for Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
, O
since O
they Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
somehow Arg-I
lower Arg-I
the Arg-I
materials Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
practical Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
university Arg-B
should Arg-I
only Arg-I
accept Arg-I
good Arg-I
students Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
gives Arg-I
better Arg-I
human Arg-I
resources Arg-I
for Arg-I
sophisticated Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
this Arg-B
may Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
' Arg-I
social Arg-I
division Arg-I
' Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
someone Arg-I
with Arg-I
high Arg-I
education Arg-I
refuses Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
called Arg-I
' Arg-I
low Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
' Arg-I
, O
but O
actually O
it Arg-B
gives Arg-I
no Arg-I
harm Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
standard Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
will Arg-I
always Arg-I
be Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
complex Arg-I
ones Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
only Arg-I
handled Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
start Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
limiting Arg-B
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
admitted Arg-I
by Arg-I
universities Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
choice Arg-I
since O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
reward Arg-I
the Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
keep Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

Ultimately O
, O
this Arg-B
improves Arg-I
the Arg-I
overall Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
gives Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
serve Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
thing O
up O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
everyone Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
compulsory Arg-I
education Arg-I
level Arg-I
up Arg-I
to Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
the Arg-I
above Arg-I
divisions Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
realm Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
both Arg-I
universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
placing Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
positions Arg-I
which Arg-I
suit Arg-I
them Arg-I
most Arg-I
. O

Improving O
facilities O
is O
the O
best O
way O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
universities O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
improving O
facilities O
is O
more O
than O
hiring O
famous O
teachers O
, O
and O
this O
topic O
can O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
prefer O
that O

should O
invest O
in O
renewing O
facilities O
, O
while O
other O
seem O
to O
believe O
that O
famous O

is O
more O
conducive O
to O
students O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
develop O
my O

perspective O
as O

I O
favor O
the O

; O
that O
is O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
improving Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
an O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
increase Arg-I
our Arg-I

For O

is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I

They Arg-B

subjects Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
tranquil Arg-I
ambience Arg-I
; Arg-I
also Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
references Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
this Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
and Arg-I
versatile Arg-I
facility Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
condition Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
commence O
to O
agree O
that O
certain Arg-B
facilities Arg-I
are Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
another O
equally O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
that O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
staying Arg-I
in Arg-I
classrooms Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
activities Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Consider Arg-B
a Arg-I
circumstance Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
member Arg-I
of Arg-I
jazz Arg-I
ensemble Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
must Arg-I
need Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
auditorium Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
extraordinary Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
this Arg-I
distinguished Arg-I
performance Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
would Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
an Arg-I
unforgettable Arg-I
and Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
experience Arg-I
burring Arg-I
deeply Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
, O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
students Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
spending Arg-I
on Arg-I
improving Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
people O
proclaiming O
that O
schools Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
hiring Arg-I
prestigious Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
impart Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
my O
limited O
understanding O
, O
I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
owing O
to O
its O
imprudence O
. O

A Arg-B
student Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
whether Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
but Arg-I
is Arg-I
decided Arg-I
by Arg-I
his Arg-I
effort Arg-I
on Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
useless Arg-I
to Arg-I
hire Arg-I
a Arg-I
super Arg-I
famous Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
as Arg-I
sluggards Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrate O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
improving Arg-B
facilities Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
school Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
are Arg-I
relatively Arg-I
greater Arg-I
than Arg-I
that Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
procure Arg-I
more Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
from Arg-I
better Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
other O
points O
of O
view O
are O
completely O
without O
merit O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
an O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
reasons O
I O
have O
proposed O
in O
favor O
of O
my O
sentiment O
are O
much O
more O
tenable O
and O
cogent O
. O

High O
schools O
must O
be O
responsible O
for O
their O
future O
with O
well O
- O
planned O
curriculum O

Some O
people O
state O
that O
high O
schools O
should O
allow O
students O
to O
study O
what O
they O
want O
to O
. O

They O
believe O
this O
motivates O
students O
to O
study O
. O

I O
think O
, O
however O
, O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
study Arg-I
a Arg-I
broad Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
from Arg-I
literature Arg-I
to Arg-I
mathematics Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
tertiary Arg-B
education Arg-I
should Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
specialization Arg-I
at Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
extent Arg-I
paternalistic Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
avoiding Arg-I
hurdles Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
students Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
one Arg-I
or Arg-I
more Arg-I
fields Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
really Arg-I
interested Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
decide Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
major Arg-I
without Arg-I
trying Arg-I
a Arg-I
broad Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
miss Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
would Arg-I
- Arg-I
be Arg-I
mathematician Arg-I
student Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
intrigued Arg-I
by Arg-I
philosophy Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Next O
, O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
academic Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

General Arg-B
education Arg-I
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Science Arg-B
today Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
said Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
combine Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
from Arg-I
chemistry Arg-I
to Arg-I
physics Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
textbooks Arg-B
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
are Arg-I
labelled Arg-I
particular Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
fact Arg-I
they Arg-I
require Arg-I
basic Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you Arg-B
sometimes Arg-I
need Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
physics Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
a Arg-I
text Arg-I
on Arg-I
chemistry Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
high Arg-B
school Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
learn Arg-I
broadly Arg-I
and Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
future Arg-I
learning Arg-I
at Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
students Arg-B
have Arg-I
tendency Arg-I
to Arg-I
shun Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
might Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
tough Arg-I
courses Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
instead Arg-I
attend Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
Mickey Arg-I
Mouse Arg-I
courses Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
might Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
limited Arg-I
choices Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
schools Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
and Arg-I
protect Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
summary O
, O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
find Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
and Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
general Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
at Arg-I
tertiary Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
high O
school O
must O
be O
responsible O
for O
their O
future O
with O
well O
- O
planned O
curriculum O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
games O
for O
adults O
comparing O
to O
children O
As O
people O
grow O
up O
, O
the O
arguments O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
games O
arise O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
, O
adults O
need O
playing O
games O
as O
children O
do O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
games Arg-B
are Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
too Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
games Arg-B
become Arg-I
unnecessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
when Arg-I
their Arg-I
careers Arg-I
begin Arg-I
. O

Someone Arg-B
may Arg-I
argue Arg-I
that Arg-I
games Arg-I
help Arg-I
adults Arg-I
relax Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
balanced Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

But O
, O
more Arg-B
often Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
commitment Arg-I
force Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
abandon Arg-I
their Arg-I
lifelong Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
spend Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
games Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
in Arg-I
15 Arg-I
or Arg-I
20 Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
except Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
minor Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
professional Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
stop Arg-I
playing Arg-I
games Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
decent Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
often Arg-I
feel Arg-I
that Arg-I
such Arg-I
games Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
troublesome Arg-I
than Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
daily Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
should O
be O
mentioned O
is O
that O
adults Arg-B
often Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
games Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
activity Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
keen Arg-I
on Arg-I
competition Arg-I
and Arg-I
winning Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
youngsters Arg-I
, Arg-I
maintaining Arg-I
their Arg-I
desire Arg-I
to Arg-I
win Arg-I
often Arg-I
develops Arg-I
many Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
whether Arg-I
they Arg-I
participate Arg-I
sport Arg-I
events Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
younger Arg-I
sister Arg-I
likes Arg-I
fencing Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
to Arg-I
her Arg-I
desire Arg-I
to Arg-I
win Arg-I
, Arg-I
she Arg-I
never Arg-I
gives Arg-I
up Arg-I
when Arg-I
facing Arg-I
a Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
situation Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
adults Arg-B
often Arg-I
consider Arg-I
such Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
as Arg-I
childish Arg-I
and Arg-I
drop Arg-I
them Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
a Arg-B
competitive Arg-I
person Arg-I
usually Arg-I
finds Arg-I
it Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
they Arg-B
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
play Arg-I
games Arg-I
for Arg-I
any Arg-I
moderate Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
interest Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
think O
adults Arg-B
do Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
their Arg-I
styles Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
distinct Arg-I
from Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
less Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
. O

Along Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
requirement Arg-I
for Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
games Arg-I
are Arg-I
just Arg-I
some Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
activities Arg-I
for Arg-I
adults Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
something Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
meant Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Opinions O
regarding O
world O
culture O

There O
are O
many O
different O
opinions O
regarding O
world O
culture O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
all O
the O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
can O
not O
have O
a O
single O
culture O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
a Arg-B
single Arg-I
modern Arg-I
culture Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
created Arg-I
by Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
for O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
countries Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
educational Arg-I
system Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
give Arg-I
topics Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
should Arg-I
research Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
data Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
type Arg-I
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
computer Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
PowerPoint Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
Iran Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
software Arg-I
, Arg-I
Microsoft Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
type Arg-I
their Arg-I
homework Arg-I
or Arg-I
have Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
Canadian Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
new Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
created Arg-I
some Arg-I
similar Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
all Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Computer Arg-B
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
growing Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
being Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
many Arg-B
immigrants Arg-I
in Arg-I
Canada Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
degree Arg-I
in Arg-I
computer Arg-I
technology Arg-I
fields Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
Canadian Arg-I
universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
find Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
. O

This O
example O
shows O
that O
jobs Arg-B
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
technology Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
demand Arg-I
in Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
making Arg-I
foods Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
unicq Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
technology Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
affect Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

This O
point O
has O
some O
merits O
on O
the O
surface O
; O
however O
, O
many Arg-B
countries Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Canada Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
USA Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
British Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
which Arg-I
serve Arg-I
many Arg-I
foods Arg-I
form Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
cooks Arg-B
can Arg-I
find Arg-I
many Arg-I
new Arg-I
food Arg-I
recipes Arg-I
easily Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
two Arg-B
days Arg-I
ago Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
Canadian Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
ate Arg-I
noodle Arg-I
, Arg-I
sushi Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
foods Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
Greek Arg-I
salad Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
new Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
affected Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
many Arg-I
similarities Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
new Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
influences Arg-I
on Arg-I
educational Arg-I

Reading O
fictions O
is O
more O
pleasant O

There O
are O
many O
different O
opinions O
regarding O
hobbies O
. O

Some O
people O
would O
rather O
watch O
TV O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
reading Arg-B
fiction Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
than Arg-I
watching Arg-I
movies Arg-I
for O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
fiction Arg-B
books Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
details Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
know Arg-I
characters Arg-I
, Arg-I
places Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
times Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
novel Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
during Arg-I
reading Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
novels Arg-I
describe Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
main Arg-I
characters Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
novels Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
each Arg-I
scene Arg-I
is Arg-I
happening Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
after Arg-B
I Arg-I
read Arg-I
animal Arg-I
farms Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
story Arg-I
of Arg-I
Russian Arg-I
revolution Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
leaders Arg-I
and Arg-I
different Arg-I
segments Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Russian Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
a Arg-B
movie Arg-I
just Arg-I
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
small Arg-I
review Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
stories Arg-I
and Arg-I
characters Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
reading Arg-B
a Arg-I
novel Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
novels Arg-I
have Arg-I
around Arg-I
100 Arg-I
pages Arg-I
and Arg-I
readers Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
finish Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
just Arg-I
one Arg-I
hour Arg-I
. O

Yet Arg-B
these Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
their Arg-I
novels Arg-I
wherever Arg-I
they Arg-I
find Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
in Arg-I
bus Arg-I
or Arg-I
trains Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
started Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
a Arg-I
novel Arg-I
since Arg-I
last Arg-I
week Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
a Arg-I
novel Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
I Arg-I
usually Arg-I
read Arg-I
it Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
coming Arg-I
home Arg-I
from Arg-I
English Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
watch Arg-I
a Arg-I
complete Arg-I
movie Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
just Arg-I
sit Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
TV Arg-I
for Arg-I
15 Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
and Arg-I
after Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
people Arg-B
enjoy Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
when O
they O
know O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
language Arg-I
by Arg-I
watching Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

This O
point O
has O
some O
merits O
on O
the O
surface O
; O
however O
, O
movies Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
language Arg-I
for Arg-I
beginners Arg-I
since O
characters Arg-B
in Arg-I
movies Arg-I
speak Arg-I
very Arg-I
fast Arg-I
and Arg-I
unclear Arg-I
for Arg-I
language Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
these Arg-I
learners Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
start Arg-I
by Arg-I
reading Arg-I
some Arg-I
novels Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
comprehensible Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
reading Arg-B
fictions Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
pleasant Arg-I
because O
these Arg-B
books Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
depth Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
language Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

Various O
local O
languages O
are O
becoming O
extinct O
Today O
, O
English O
is O
commonly O
used O
language O
across O
the O
world O
. O

Its O
usage O
is O
increasing O
day O
by O
day O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
various O
local O
languages O
are O
becoming O
extinct O
. O

Some O
people O
argue O
that O
, O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
change O
and O
would O
help O
people O
to O
easily O
communicate O
. O

While O
there O
are O
others O
who O
disagree O
with O
this O
and O
are O
more O
concerned O
about O
dying O
local O
languages O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
using Arg-B
single Arg-I
language Arg-I
through Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
change Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
helping Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
world Arg-I
with Arg-I
fewer Arg-I
languages Arg-I
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Due Arg-B
to Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
for Arg-I
professional Arg-I
trips Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
communicating Arg-B
in Arg-I
single Arg-I
language Arg-I
will Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
of Arg-I
travelers Arg-I
in Arg-I
daily Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
ordering Arg-I
food Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
or Arg-I
in Arg-I
going Arg-I
around Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
migrate Arg-I
for Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
through Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
stress Arg-I
as O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
any Arg-I
discussions Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
world Arg-I
with Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
languages Arg-I
; Arg-I
this Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
makes Arg-I
it Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
adjust Arg-I
in Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Single Arg-B
language Arg-I
also Arg-I
reduces Arg-I
misunderstandings Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Adding O
to O
that O
, O
exchange Arg-B
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
like Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
, Arg-I
medical Arg-I
, Arg-I
astronomy Arg-I
etc Arg-I
would Arg-I
become Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
few Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
worried Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
dying Arg-I
local Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
languages Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
basis Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
origination Arg-I
and Arg-I
initial Arg-I
communication Arg-I
between Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
represent Arg-I
local Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
the Arg-I
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
languages Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
, Arg-I
culture Arg-I
also Arg-I
changes Arg-I
accordingly Arg-I
. O

Further O
, O
these Arg-B
languages Arg-I
are Arg-I
tightly Arg-I
coupled Arg-I
with Arg-I
history Arg-I
; Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
olden Arg-I
day Arg-I
literature Arg-I
and Arg-I
scripts Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
to Arg-I
decipher Arg-I
if Arg-I
these Arg-I
languages Arg-I
are Arg-I
lost Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
believe O
change Arg-B
is Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
language Arg-I
across Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

We O
have O
to O
accept O
these O
changes O
for O
a O
world O
to O
be O
a O
better O
place O
. O

Communication Arg-B
in Arg-I
single Arg-I
language Arg-I
would Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
brings Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
on Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
page Arg-I
. O

Do O
you O
believe O
that O
elderly O
people O
used O
to O
live O
in O
a O
better O
world O
? O

Changes O
are O
inseparable O
parts O
of O
this O
world O
which O
normally O
humans O
are O
responsible O
for O
by O
manipulating O
the O
environment O
they O
live O
in O
. O

Sometimes O
these O
changes O
adversely O
affect O
our O
lives O
that O
make O
elderly O
people O
think O
they O
used O
to O
live O
in O
a O
better O
world O
than O
the O
modern O
world O
the O
younger O
generation O
are O
experiencing O
. O

I O
utterly O
disagree O
with O
this O
opinion O
due O
to O
technological O
and O
medical O
reasons O
. O

We Arg-B
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
era Arg-I
that Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
developing Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
speed Arg-I
of Arg-I
light Arg-I
, Arg-I
steering Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
toward Arg-I
a Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
clear Arg-I
- Arg-I
cut Arg-I
example Arg-I
that Arg-I
supports Arg-I
this Arg-I
idea Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
invention Arg-I
of Arg-I
smart Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
strong Arg-I
navigation Arg-I
system Arg-I
installed Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
phones Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
rescued Arg-I
lives Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
who Arg-I
left Arg-I
alone Arg-I
in Arg-I
remote Arg-I
areas Arg-I
like Arg-I
forests Arg-I
or Arg-I
deserts Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
criticize Arg-I
social Arg-I
networks Arg-I
as Arg-I
tools Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
ruined Arg-I
true Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
and Arg-I
friendships Arg-I
by Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
though O
, O
social Arg-B
networks Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Facebook Arg-I
could Arg-I
foster Arg-I
the Arg-I
ties Arg-I
between Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
obligatorily Arg-I
far Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
by Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
touch Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
was Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
20 Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
phenomenal Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
medical Arg-I
science Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
last Arg-I
decade Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
and Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
happier Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

Today O
, O
even Arg-B
some Arg-I
disabled Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
serious Arg-I
vertebral Arg-I
injuries Arg-I
can Arg-I
start Arg-I
doing Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
walking Arg-I
again Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
continuingly Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
of Arg-I
biomechanical Arg-I
engineers Arg-I
and Arg-I
neurologists Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
advancement Arg-I
in Arg-I
drug Arg-I
delivery Arg-I
systems Arg-I
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
example Arg-I
that Arg-I
could Arg-I
save Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

To O
be O
specific O
, O
scientists Arg-B
could Arg-I
invent Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
lead Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
directly Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
organs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
body Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
miraculous Arg-I
breakthrough Arg-I
. O

In O
general O
, O
the Arg-B
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
average Arg-I
age Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
from Arg-I
50 Arg-I
to Arg-I
around Arg-I
75 Arg-I
years Arg-I
through Arg-I
last Arg-I
decades Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
strong Arg-I
evidence Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
how Arg-I
successful Arg-I
human Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
even O
though O
the Arg-B
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
older Arg-I
generation Arg-I
may Arg-I
claim Arg-I
they Arg-I
had Arg-I
better Arg-I
life Arg-I
as O
there Arg-B
were Arg-I
stronger Arg-I
bonds Arg-I
between Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, O
I O
think O
they O
are O
wrong O
, O
since O
they Arg-B
judge Arg-I
the Arg-I
contemporary Arg-I
age Arg-I
through Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
prejudice Arg-I
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
facts O
, O
one O
can O
easily O
conclude O
that O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
world Arg-I
living Arg-I
standards Arg-I
stand Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
much Arg-I
higher Arg-I
level Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
better Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
socially Arg-I
and Arg-I
physically Arg-I
. O

Higher O
school O
students O
should O
be O
taught O
how O
to O
manage O
money O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
money O
has O
become O
key O
ingredient O
in O
various O
walks O
of O
our O
life O
than O
before O
. O

Teaching O
financial O
management O
to O
juvenile O
students O
is O
always O
a O
topic O
of O
debate O
. O

Some O
people O
feel O
that O
teaching O
money O
management O
skill O
to O
teenage O
students O
will O
help O
them O
realise O
the O
importance O
of O
money O
, O
while O
few O
feel O
that O
exposing O
children O
to O
money O
math O
at O
this O
age O
may O
turn O
fatal O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
agree O
to O
that O
fact O
that O
higher Arg-B
school Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
. O

The O
reason O
why O
I O
think O
teenage Arg-B
students Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
basics Arg-I
is O
, O
primarily O
when Arg-B
secondary Arg-I
school Arg-I
students Arg-I
attain Arg-I
the Arg-I
age Arg-I
of Arg-I
undergoing Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
ought Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
in Arg-I
hostels Arg-I
or Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
during Arg-I
such Arg-I
situations Arg-I
when Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
is Arg-I
taught Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
increased Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
and Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
while Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
kid Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
expense Arg-I
log Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
month Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
keep Arg-I
track Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
pocket Arg-I
money Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
, Arg-I
during Arg-I
my Arg-I
future Arg-I
course Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
this Arg-I
became Arg-I
a Arg-I
practice Arg-I
and Arg-I
helped Arg-I
me Arg-I
in Arg-I
planning Arg-I
my Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
if Arg-B
financial Arg-I
management Arg-I
is Arg-I
taught Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
financial Arg-I
background Arg-I
and Arg-I
status Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
coming Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
unrealistic Arg-I
whims Arg-I
and Arg-I
fancies Arg-I
are Arg-I
minimized Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
buying Arg-B
a Arg-I
gaming Arg-I
console Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
deal Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
from Arg-I
an Arg-I
affluent Arg-I
financial Arg-I
background Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
for Arg-B
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
coming Arg-I
from Arg-I
middle Arg-I
class Arg-I
buying Arg-I
a Arg-I
gaming Arg-I
console Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
hour Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
having Arg-B
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
level Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
prioritizing Arg-I
the Arg-I
financial Arg-I
commitments Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
students Arg-B
understanding Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
than Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the O
teaching O
should O
be O
in O
a O
constructive O
manner O
and O
students O
should O
not O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
being O
bullied O
for O
every O
expense O
. O

Smoking O
should O
not O
be O
permitted O
in O
restaurants O
Generally O
speaking O
, O
smoking O
is O
never O
been O
good O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
researches O
done O
to O
prove O
that O
a O
cigar O
contains O
harmful O
ingredients O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

Although O
many O
smokers O
claim O
that O
they O
need O
to O
smoke O
in O
order O
to O
work O
more O
effectively O
or O
to O
think O
more O
creatively O
, O
those O
reasons O
never O
proves O
that O
smoking O
has O
any O
benefits O
for O
human O
's O
body O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
smoking Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
permitted Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
like Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
breathe Arg-I
uncomfortably Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
restaurants Arg-B
are Arg-I
places Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
come Arg-I
and Arg-I
pay Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
. O

Smoking Arg-B
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
will Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
disturb Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
enjoying Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
while Arg-I
breathing Arg-I
in Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
around Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
restaurants Arg-B
are Arg-I
places Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
usually Arg-I
come Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
, O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
grandparents Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
pregnant Arg-I
women Arg-I
inside Arg-I
the Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
. O

Smoking Arg-B
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
example Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
potential Arg-I
to Arg-I
imitate Arg-I
what Arg-I
adults Arg-I
do Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
really Arg-I
high Arg-I
curiosity Arg-I
towards Arg-I
something Arg-I
. O

Smoking Arg-B
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
affect Arg-I
the Arg-I
elders Arg-I
' Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
hearts Arg-I
and Arg-I
lungs Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
most Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
people Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
affected Arg-I
by Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
pregnant Arg-I
women Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
breathe Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
contaminated Arg-I
air Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
disrupt Arg-I
the Arg-I
growth Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
babies Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
passive Arg-B
smokers Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
risks Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
active Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
inhale Arg-I
hazardous Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
. O

Stroke Arg-B
, Arg-I
heart Arg-I
disorders Arg-I
, Arg-I
hearing Arg-I
loss Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
cancers Arg-I
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
attack Arg-I
passive Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
. O

Personally O
speaking O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
for Arg-I
passive Arg-I
smokers Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
same Arg-I
health Arg-I
risks Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
active Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
smoking Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
permitted Arg-I
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
because O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
get Arg-I
disadvantaged Arg-I
. O

State O
laws O
that O
prohibit O
it O
should O
be O
upheld O
so O
the O
restaurant O
' O
management O
can O
make O
a O
clear O
rule O
in O
their O
restaurants O
because O
everyone O
has O
a O
right O
to O
enjoy O
their O
meals O
. O

Growing O
violence O
in O
films O
has O
affected O
youngsters O
in O
a O
negative O
way O
? O

It O
's O
obvious O
that O
violent O
behavior O
is O
growing O
more O
in O
films O
in O
recent O
20 O
years O
. O

This O
matter O
has O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
way O
to O
advertise O
a O
film O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
violence Arg-B
in Arg-I
movies Arg-I
has Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
, Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
& Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
children Arg-B
behaviors Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
concerning Arg-I
matter Arg-I
which Arg-I
parents Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Imagine Arg-B
an Arg-I
actor Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
’s Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
is Arg-I
doing Arg-I
violent Arg-I
roles Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
child Arg-I
would Arg-I
imitate Arg-I
the Arg-I
actor Arg-I
's Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
unexpectedly Arg-B
the Arg-I
violent Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
has Arg-I
effected Arg-I
on Arg-I
child Arg-I
’s Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
human Arg-B
beings Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
sensitive Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
of Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
dying Arg-B
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
a Arg-I
disappointing Arg-I
happening Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
killing Arg-B
is Arg-I
worse Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
if Arg-B
these Arg-I
scenes Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
TV Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
probably Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
viewer Arg-I
who Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
beside O
all O
above O
mentioned O
items O
, O
the Arg-B
study Arg-I
of Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
shall Arg-I
always Arg-I
been Arg-I
controlled Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
child Arg-I
watches Arg-I
a Arg-I
frightening Arg-I
movie Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he Arg-B
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
condition O
, O
because O
he Arg-B
is Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
movie Arg-I
or Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
has Arg-I
happened Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
his Arg-I
study Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
the Arg-B
study Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
youngster Arg-I
would Arg-I
affected Arg-I
terribly Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
certainly O
can O
say O
that O
growing Arg-B
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
films Arg-I
have Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
, Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
and Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
think O
this O
matter O
should O
be O
controlled O
by O
parents O
or O
somehow O
by O
directors O
. O

Gossip O
- O
based O
information O

Nowadays O
information O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
our O
world O
. O

It O
has O
become O
a O
product O
, O
which O
can O
be O
sold O
, O
bought O
, O
or O
stolen O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
: O
" O
information Arg-B
is Arg-I
power Arg-I
" O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
to O
be O
well O
- O
informed O
. O

I O
consider O
the O
statement O
above O
to O
be O
right O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
by Arg-B
using Arg-I
different Arg-I
sources Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
its Arg-I
reliability Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
disinform Arg-I
you Arg-I
on Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
's Arg-I
why Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
rather Arg-I
unwise Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
conclusions Arg-I
before Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
confident Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Russian Arg-B
news Arg-I
announced Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
war Arg-I
between Arg-I
Osetia Arg-I
and Arg-I
Georgia Arg-I
had Arg-I
been Arg-I
initiated Arg-I
by Arg-I
Georgia Arg-I
, Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
european Arg-I
news Arg-I
announced Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
initiated Arg-I
by Arg-I
Russia Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
a Arg-I
while Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
became Arg-I
clear Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
before Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
had Arg-I
already Arg-I
condemned Arg-I
the Arg-I
actions Arg-I
of Arg-I
Russia Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
facts Arg-I
about Arg-I
some Arg-I
events Arg-I
or Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
estimations Arg-I
, O
because O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
conclusion Arg-I
or Arg-I
estimate Arg-I
. O

Sometimes O
it O
can O
be O
really O
difficult O
to O
find O
out O
the O
facts O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
internet O
, O
that O
's O
why O
you Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
through Arg-I
different Arg-I
sources Arg-I
before Arg-I
you Arg-I
manage Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
some Arg-I
reliable Arg-I
facts Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
decision Arg-I
because O
you Arg-B
have Arg-I
just Arg-I
used Arg-I
someone Arg-I
's Arg-I
personal Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
actually Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
several Arg-B
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
in Arg-I
Moscow Arg-I
salt Arg-I
became Arg-I
two Arg-I
times Arg-I
more Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
week Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
people Arg-I
thought Arg-I
that Arg-I
soon Arg-I
there Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
salt Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
shops Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
gossip Arg-I
- Arg-I
based Arg-I
information Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
the Arg-I
prices Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
after Arg-I
official Arg-I
announcement Arg-I
the Arg-I
" Arg-I
salt Arg-I
- Arg-I
panic Arg-I
" Arg-I
was Arg-I
over Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
confident Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
you Arg-I
use Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
when Arg-I
your Arg-I
conclusion Arg-I
or Arg-I
decision Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
influence Arg-I
. O

Old O
buildings O
should O
be O
preserved O
The O
preservation O
of O
old O
buildings O
always O
is O
a O
large O
question O
for O
governments O
because O
conflict O
between O
the O
issues O
of O
housing O
for O
citizens O
and O
the O
protection O
of O
our O
culture O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
all Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
old Arg-I
building Arg-I
which Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
conserved Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
different O
reasons O
which O
persuade O
that O
people O
should O
not O
restore O
old O
buildings O
. O

As Arg-B
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
rapid Arg-I
urbanization Arg-I
process Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
rural Arg-I
people Arg-I
must Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
urban Arg-I
centers Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
for Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
question Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
pressing Arg-I
. O

Because O
of O
that O
need O
, O
governments Arg-B
can Arg-I
construct Arg-I
more Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
preserving Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
preservation Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
because Arg-I
all Arg-I
components Arg-I
of Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
have Arg-I
historical Arg-I
values Arg-I
. O

Old Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
are Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
history Arg-I
. O

Tourist Arg-B
often Arg-I
decide Arg-I
to Arg-I
discover Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
visit Arg-I
through Arg-I
those Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
managers Arg-B
of Arg-I
cities Arg-I
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
attraction Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
amount Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
conservation Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
conserve Arg-I
our Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
much Arg-I
from Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Old Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
museums Arg-I
and Arg-I
provide Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
there Arg-I
. O
. O

Many Arg-B
cities Arg-I
have Arg-I
development Arg-I
strategies Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
contains Arg-I
both Arg-I
unique Arg-I
and Arg-I
modern Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
half Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Overall O
, O
both O
of O
those O
view O
have O
strong O
arguments O
: O
the O
need O
for O
housing O
or O
the O
expense O
of O
restoration O
contrast O
with O
our O
desire O
to O
conserve O
culture O
and O
attract O
tourism O
. O

So O
I O
think O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
restore Arg-I
those Arg-I
building Arg-I
because O
old Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
process Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
feature Arg-I
of Arg-I
areas Arg-I
which Arg-I
contain Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Popularity O
of O
mobile O
phones O
to O
young O
people O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
young O
people O
consider O
mobile O
phone O
as O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
their O
lives O
as O
it O
keeps O
them O
constantly O
organized O
and O
it O
provides O
much O
convenience O
for O
them O
to O
reach O
out O
their O
families O
and O
friends O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
aspects O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the Arg-B
popularity Arg-I
of Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
generation Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many Arg-B
young Arg-I
owners Arg-I
of Arg-I
cellular Arg-I
phones Arg-I
are Arg-I
struggling Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
because Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

Games Arg-B
and Arg-I
applications Arg-I
installed Arg-I
in Arg-I
phones Arg-I
have Arg-I
occupied Arg-I
much Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
leaving Arg-I
them Arg-I
lesser Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
school Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Similarly O
, O
internet Arg-B
capable Arg-I
phones Arg-I
help Arg-I
influence Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
ones Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
chatting Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
sites Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
doing Arg-I
school Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
my Arg-I
college Arg-I
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
once Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
game Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
cellular Arg-I
phone Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
spent Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
level Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
- Arg-I
off Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
goal Arg-I
has Arg-I
led Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
lost Arg-I
in Arg-I
interest Arg-I
on Arg-I
doing Arg-I
my Arg-I
homework Arg-I

and Arg-I
I Arg-I
ended Arg-I
up Arg-I
failing Arg-I
one Arg-I
subject Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
semester Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
juveniles Arg-B
who Arg-I
possess Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
tendencies Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
materialistic Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
a Arg-I
phone Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
functionality Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
for Arg-I
its Arg-I
brand Arg-I
. O

Relatively O
, O
these Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
come Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
and Arg-I
inexpensive Arg-I
cost Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
juveniles Arg-I
are Arg-I
students Arg-I
so O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
need Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
them Arg-I
financially Arg-I
for Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
illustration Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
unfortunate Arg-I
trend Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
almost Arg-I
everywhere Arg-I
these Arg-I
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
wherein Arg-I
most Arg-I
teens Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
own Arg-I
phones Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
worth Arg-I
twice Arg-I
the Arg-I
salary Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

This O
clearly O
shows O
that O
the Arg-B
negative Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
brought Arg-I
about Arg-I
by Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
are Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
’s Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
character Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
highly O
discourage O
the O
young O
ones O
to O
be O
overly O
dependent O
on O
mobile O
phones O
. O

Leisure O
activities O
- O
Spend O
your O
free O
time O
outdoors O
or O
indoors O
. O

People O
often O
relax O
themselves O
by O
joining O
leisure O
activities O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
spend O
their O
free O
time O
indoors O
. O

But O
from O
my O
experience O
, O
I Arg-B
myself Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
my Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
outdoors Arg-I
because O
I O
strongly O
feel O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
keep Arg-I
my Arg-I
body Arg-I
fit Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
outdoor Arg-B
activities Arg-I
enable Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
natural Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
strong O
advantages O
to O
spend O
leisure O
time O
outdoors O
. O

One O
benefit O
is O
that O
doing Arg-B
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
and Arg-I
baseball Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
last Arg-B
year Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
spent Arg-I
my Arg-I
summer Arg-I
time Arg-I
playing Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
and Arg-I
baseball Arg-I
. O

Playing Arg-B
baseball Arg-I
provided Arg-I
my Arg-I
upper Arg-I
body Arg-I
for Arg-I
hitting Arg-I
and Arg-I
throwing Arg-I
. O

Soccer Arg-B
, Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
hand Arg-I
, Arg-I
developed Arg-I
my Arg-I
lower Arg-I
body Arg-I
for Arg-I
kicking Arg-I
and Arg-I
endurance Arg-I
for Arg-I
playing Arg-I
full Arg-I
90-minute Arg-I
- Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

I O
belive O
that O
practicing Arg-B
these Arg-I
sports Arg-I
helped Arg-I
me Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
. O

Something O
else O
that O
is O
good O
is O
that O
playing Arg-B
these Arg-I
sports Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
my Arg-I
body Arg-I
fit Arg-I
, Arg-I
make Arg-I
me Arg-I
ultimately Arg-I
refreshed Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
that Arg-I
summer Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
body Arg-I
is Arg-I
stronger Arg-I
and Arg-I
endurance Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Outdoor Arg-B
activities Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
improves Arg-I
my Arg-I
health Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
gives Arg-I
me Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
ten Arg-I
years Arg-I
old Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
shy Arg-I
girl Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
mother Arg-I
took Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
The Arg-I
National Arg-I
Camp Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
first Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
just Arg-I
ate Arg-I
and Arg-I
played Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
third Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
girl Arg-I
came Arg-I
and Arg-I
greeted Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
became Arg-I
friend Arg-I
later Arg-I
and Arg-I
she Arg-I
taught Arg-I
me Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
swim Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
. O

On Arg-B
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
played Arg-I
together Arg-I
and Arg-I
she Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
her Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
her Arg-I
and Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
going Arg-I
skiing Arg-I
, Arg-I
climbing Arg-I
the Arg-I
mountain Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
since Arg-I
The Arg-I
National Arg-I
Camp Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
n't Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
camping Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
many Arg-I
friends Arg-I
like Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
nature Arg-I
when Arg-I
doing Arg-I
some Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
going Arg-I
hiking Arg-I
, Arg-I
sunbathing Arg-I
, Arg-I
going Arg-I
biking Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
spend Arg-I
your Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
or Arg-I
something Arg-I
like Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
nature Arg-I
. O

Spending Arg-B
time Arg-I
outdoors Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
breathe Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
air Arg-I
, Arg-I
feel Arg-I
the Arg-I
warm Arg-I
sun Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
face Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
complete Arg-I
peace Arg-I
that Arg-I
only Arg-I
nature Arg-I
brings Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
indoor Arg-B
activities Arg-I
are Arg-I
fun Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
's Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
that Arg-I
indoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
reading Arg-I
a Arg-I
book Arg-I
, Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
music Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
us Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
joy Arg-I
. O

Although O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
fun Arg-I
in Arg-I
indoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, O
this Arg-B
advantage Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
coming Arg-I
from Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
people O
are O
people O
and O
we O
have O
our O
own O
propensity O
. O

Leisure O
activities O
are O
one O
of O
them O

and O
I Arg-B
myself Arg-I
choose Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
my Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Cheap O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
encouraged O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
many O
airlines O
offer O
to O
their O
customers O
more O
and O
more O
number O
of O
cheap O
flights O
. O

People O
have O
various O
different O
views O
about O
cheap O
air O
travel O
. O

Although O
there O
are O
good O
arguments O
in O
favour O
of O
this O
trend O
should O
be O
encouraged O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
cheap Arg-B
flight Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
many Arg-I
serious Arg-I
problem Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
cheap Arg-B
air Arg-I
fares Arg-I
have Arg-I
broadened Arg-I
travel Arg-I
possibilities Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
lower Arg-I
income Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
millions Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
travel Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
for Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
careers Arg-I
, Arg-I
broad Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
varied Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
backgrounds Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
travels Arg-B
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
industry Arg-I
development Arg-I
, Arg-I
boost Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
and Arg-I
job Arg-I
markets Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
growing Arg-B
of Arg-I
cheap Arg-I
flights Arg-I
really Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
more Arg-B
flights Arg-I
could Arg-I
mean Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
and Arg-I
busier Arg-I
airport Arg-I
that Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
grown Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
close Arg-I
to Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
biggest Arg-I
concern Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

Burning Arg-B
plane Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
can Arg-I
releases Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxid Arg-I
into Arg-I
environment Arg-I
that Arg-I
cause Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
to Arg-I
heat Arg-I
up Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while Arg-B
many Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
are Arg-I
being Arg-I
made Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
CO2 Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
from Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
factories Arg-I
, Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
done Arg-I
to Arg-I
reins Arg-I
the Arg-I
airlines Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
the Arg-B
drawbacks Arg-I
of Arg-I
cheap Arg-I
air Arg-I
fares Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
more O
expensive O
. O

Instead O
, O
people O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
their O
responsibility O
to O
reduce O
the O
emissions O
caused O
by O
their O
lifestyle O
choices O
. O

Salary O
increases O
and O
promotions O
to O
new O
positions O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ways O

It O
is O
unquestionable O
that O
salary O
increases O
and O
promotions O
to O
new O
positions O
are O
very O
common O
way O
to O
reward O
employees O
for O
good O
work O
. O

Besides O
the O
methods O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
providing Arg-B
professional Arg-I
training Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
effective Arg-I
in Arg-I
encouraging Arg-I
further Arg-I
good Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

My O
arguments O
for O
this O
point O
are O
listed O
follows O
. O

Firstly O
, O
training Arg-B
time Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
employee Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
time Arg-I
outside Arg-I
working Arg-I
office Arg-I
to Arg-I
refresh Arg-I
their Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

Clearly O
, O
in Arg-B
company Arg-I
we Arg-I
always Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
so Arg-I
many Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
situations Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
negotiating Arg-I
with Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
customer Arg-I
, Arg-I
complaining Arg-I
from Arg-I
boss Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
unleash Arg-I
uncomfortable Arg-I
in Arg-I
training Arg-I
classes Arg-I
by Arg-I
making Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
joking Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
, Arg-I
enjoying Arg-I
new Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
employees Arg-B
fell Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
trained Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the Arg-B
employees Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
investing Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
future Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

So O
obviously O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
develop Arg-I
long Arg-I
term Arg-I
career Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

For O
another O
thing O
, O
employees Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
proud Arg-I
of Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
provided Arg-I
training Arg-I
while Arg-I
others Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
this Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
providing Arg-B
training Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
employees Arg-I
happy Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
current Arg-I
job Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
professional Arg-I
business Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
professional Arg-I
training Arg-I
help Arg-I
employees Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
business Arg-I
, O
so O
I O
believe O
that O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
finish Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
with Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
result Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
excellent Arg-B
working Arg-I
result Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
very Arg-I
happy Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
boss Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
providing Arg-B
professional Arg-I
training Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
reward Arg-I
for Arg-I
good Arg-I
work Arg-I
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

Training Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
employees Arg-I
refresh Arg-I
their Arg-I
mind Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
happy Arg-I
, Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Taking O
into O
account O
of O
all O
these O
factors O
, O
we O
may O
reach O
the O
conclusion O
that O
training Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
effective Arg-I
in Arg-I
encouraging Arg-I
further Arg-I
good Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Attending O
university O
classes O
should O
be O
required O
or O
optional O
Attending O
university O
's O
classes O
is O
one O
of O
activities O
that O
students O
have O
to O
do O
. O

However O
, O
class O
is O
not O
the O
only O
source O
of O
knowledge O
. O

Students O
also O
learn O
from O
other O
sources O
such O
as O
experience O
, O
libraries O
and O
other O
people O
. O

I O
think O
going Arg-B
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
optional Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
for O
the O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
reason O
why O
university O
students O
should O
not O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
class O
is O
sometimes Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
better Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
sources Arg-I
outside Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
room Arg-I
. O

Student Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
study Arg-I
by Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
library Arg-I
and Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
topic Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
understand Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
close Arg-I
friend Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
department Arg-I
with Arg-I
me Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

She Arg-B
learned Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
and Arg-I
understood Arg-I
everything Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
so Arg-I
fast Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
she Arg-B
rarely Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
class Arg-I
but Arg-I
spent Arg-I
most Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
confusing Arg-I
topic Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
she Arg-B
got Arg-I
very Arg-I
good Arg-I
grade Arg-I
when Arg-I
she Arg-I
was Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
students O
should O
not O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
because O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
spending Arg-I
on Arg-I
classes Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
other Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
things Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
already Arg-I
understand Arg-I
topic Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
experience O
, O
many Arg-B
times Arg-I
I Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
attend Arg-I
biology Arg-I
class Arg-I
because Arg-I
my Arg-I
university Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
require Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
I Arg-B
had Arg-I
already Arg-I
studied Arg-I
all Arg-I
biology Arg-I
topics Arg-I
before Arg-I
attending Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I Arg-B
spent Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
biology Arg-I
class Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
my Arg-I
Chemistry Arg-I
research Arg-I
and Arg-I
got Arg-I
A+ Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
biology Arg-I
and Arg-I
chemistry Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
the Arg-B
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
activities Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
management Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they O
have O
to O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O

So O
that O
, O
attending Arg-B

in Arg-I
the Arg-I

not Arg-I

required Arg-I

Small O

In O
a O

I O

I Arg-B

Big Arg-B

First O

all O

easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
an Arg-I
engineering Arg-I

the Arg-I
city Arg-I

Electrical Arg-B
engineering Arg-I

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
can Arg-I
offer Arg-I
me Arg-I
many Arg-I
more Arg-I

than Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I

At Arg-B
the Arg-I

I Arg-B

the Arg-I

I Arg-I

definitely Arg-I

A Arg-B

Cultural Arg-B

I Arg-B
am Arg-I
keen Arg-I
on Arg-I

What O

more O
, O
cities Arg-B
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
medical Arg-I

the Arg-I

This Arg-B

at Arg-I

In O

Computers O

The O
advent O

the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
results O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
advantaged O

While O
some O
people O
advocate O
for O
the O
idea O
that O

others O

the O

. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
computers Arg-B
brought Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
and Arg-I
easiness Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
since O
they Arg-B
enabled Arg-I
easier Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
increased Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
computers Arg-B
through Arg-I
internet Arg-I
made Arg-I
our Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
information Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
computers Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
collect Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
data Arg-I
very Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
, Arg-I
store Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
hard Arg-I
disc Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
we Arg-I
want Arg-I
and Arg-I
use Arg-I
it Arg-I
when Arg-I
needed Arg-I
. O

Search Arg-B
engines Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
google Arg-I
, Arg-I
yandex Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
features Arg-I
relevant Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I

few Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
. O

Social Arg-B
networks Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
facebook Arg-I

twitter Arg-I
have Arg-I
changed Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
sources Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
decreasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
monopolization Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
governments Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
computers Arg-I
we Arg-I
spend Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
search Arg-I
for Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
it Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
sources Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
globalized Arg-I
world Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
live Arg-I
computers Arg-I
made Arg-I
communications Arg-I
faster Arg-I
, Arg-I
visual Arg-I
and Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
email Arg-I
our Arg-I
messages Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
delivered Arg-I
to Arg-I
any Arg-I
person Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
in Arg-I
few Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
because O
you Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
mile Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
post Arg-I
office Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
just Arg-I
click Arg-I
the Arg-I
mouse Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
computer Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I

order Arg-I

any Arg-I

the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Internet Arg-B
facilities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
msn Arg-I
, Arg-I
skype Arg-I
made Arg-I
visual Arg-I
communication Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
via Arg-B
skype Arg-I
people Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
interviews Arg-I
for Arg-I
employment Arg-I
, Arg-I
enrolment Arg-I
into Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

In O
result O
, O
communication Arg-B
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
, Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
visual Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
computers Arg-B
have Arg-I
made Arg-I
life Arg-I
easier Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
in O
the O
ways O
that O
it Arg-B
broadened Arg-I
the Arg-I
sources Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
made Arg-I
access Arg-I
more Arg-I
quick Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
improving Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
communication Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Computers O
have O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
office O
workers O
to O
do O
their O
work O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
working O
at O
home O
brings O
to O
workers O
and O
employees O
too O
much O
convenience O
, O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
. O

Because O
the O
best O
conditions O
are O
sometimes O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
good O
as O
the O
expectation O
of O
people O
. O

Working O
without O
pressure O
and O
interaction O
are O
some O
examples O
for O
these O
disadvantages O
. O

Pressure Arg-B
is Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
. O

Each Arg-B
office Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
rules Arg-I
that Arg-I
keep Arg-I
workers Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
as Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I

The Arg-B
directors Arg-I
manage Arg-I
employers Arg-I
and Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
deadline Arg-I
of Arg-I
projects Arg-I
. O

Then Arg-B
again Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
must Arg-I
try Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
limit Arg-I

Doing Arg-B
all Arg-I

at Arg-I

do Arg-I

this Arg-I

Computers Arg-B
and Arg-I
modems Arg-I
bring Arg-I

these Arg-I

the Arg-I

however Arg-I

they Arg-I

the Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
why Arg-I

The Arg-B
dos Arg-I

important Arg-I
role Arg-I

things Arg-I
from Arg-I

In O
condition O

doing Arg-B
all Arg-I

easily Arg-I

As O
a O
result O
, O
the Arg-B
project Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I

The Arg-B
best Arg-I
condition Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I

Interaction Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
an Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
for Arg-I
workers Arg-I
at Arg-I
offices Arg-I

Discussing Arg-B

debating Arg-I
Projects Arg-I
together Arg-I
increase Arg-I

all Arg-B
we Arg-I

Besides O

they Arg-B

Interaction Arg-B

a Arg-I
factor Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
working Arg-I

There Arg-B

if Arg-I
the Arg-I

Mitigating Arg-B
process Arg-I

no Arg-I
interaction Arg-I

these Arg-I

On O
one O

the Arg-B

With Arg-B
the Arg-I

On O
the O

the Arg-B

likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
bring Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I

People Arg-B
utilize Arg-I

This Arg-B
would Arg-I
pose Arg-I

large Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
ecology Arg-I

Vehicle Arg-B
technology Arg-I

to Arg-I
drive Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I

emission Arg-I

In O
conclusion O

although O

it Arg-B
still Arg-I
provides Arg-I
us Arg-I
with Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

A O
greater O
proportion O
of O
the O
budget O
should O
be O
allotted O
to O
education O
and O
prevention O
issues O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
welfare O
state O
requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O
health O
education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
devote Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
portion Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
budgets Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
means Arg-I
for Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
reason O
why O
education O
and O
preventative O
measures O
should O
receive O
a O
greater O
budget O
is O
the O
potential O
improvements O
in O
health O
system O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing Arg-B
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I

to Arg-I
be Arg-I

effectively Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
better Arg-I
treatments Arg-I
for Arg-I

Therefore O
, O
society Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
educated Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
issues Arg-I
so O
that O
the Arg-B
potential Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments O
should O
allocate O
more O
budget O
on O
prevention O
from O
illness O
and O
providing O
health O
education O
is O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
society O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
health Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
come Arg-I
with Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
government Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
providing Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
lead Arg-I
its Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
from Arg-I
potential Arg-I
illness Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
cause Arg-I
misery Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
marketing Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
of Arg-I
Ministry Arg-I
of Arg-I
Health Arg-I
in Arg-I
Turkey Arg-I
which Arg-I
aimed Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
problem Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
youth Arg-I
increased Arg-I
the Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
quit Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
and Arg-I
adapted Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
greater Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
allotted Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
issues Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
more Arg-I

Zoos O

no O
useful O
purpose O
? O

Have O

bear O
or O
a O
monkey O
? O

If O
you O
did O
, O
it O
was O
probably O
at O
a O
zoo O
. O

Zoos O
are O
big O
outdoor O
spaces O
in O
which O
different O
animal O

kept O
, O
so O
that O
people O
can O
look O

them O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
think O
that O
zoos O
have O
no O
use O
, O
or O
provide O
no O
purpose O
. O

I O
strongly O
disagree O
with O
this O
affirmation O
because O
I O
believe O
zoos Arg-B
provide Arg-I
social Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
develop Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
animal Arg-I
respect Arg-I
and Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
visit Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
normally Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
school Arg-I
group Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
they Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
and Arg-I
look Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
play Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
comment Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
and Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
laugh Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
funny Arg-I
customs Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
families Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
spend Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
together Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
couple Arg-I
of Arg-I
decades Arg-I
ago Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
spending Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
activity Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
enjoyed Arg-I
every Arg-I
family Arg-I
member Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
little Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
grandparents Arg-I
. O

Animals Arg-B
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
species Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
and Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
subject Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
from Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
even Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
visuals Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
visit Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
get Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
customs Arg-I
, Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
eat Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
eat Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
which Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
species Arg-I
have Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
an Arg-I
animal Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
different Arg-I
variations Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
male Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
female Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
baby Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
adult Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
offers Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
observe Arg-I
their Arg-I
reactions Arg-I
to Arg-I
different Arg-I
situations Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
weather Arg-I
, Arg-I
specie Arg-I
and Arg-I
genre Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
, Arg-I
defense Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
protection Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
babies Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
identify Arg-I
which Arg-I
animals Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
. O

Visiting Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
would Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
understand Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
learn Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
a Arg-B
visit Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
someone Arg-I
's Arg-I
respect Arg-I
and Arg-I
appreciation Arg-I
for Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
something Arg-I
after Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
seen Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
learned Arg-I
from Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
especially Arg-I
true Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
animals Arg-I
they Arg-I
normally Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
are Arg-I
pets Arg-I
like Arg-I
cats Arg-I
and Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
present Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
respect Arg-I
for Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
facts Arg-I
about Arg-I
them Arg-I
would Arg-I
help Arg-I
by Arg-I
making Arg-I
people Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
respect Arg-I
they Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
. O

The O
reason O
why O
most O
people O
oppose O
to O
zoos O
is O
that O
in Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
taken Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
and Arg-I
clean Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
true Arg-I
but Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
relate Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
. O

It O
would O
be O
great O
if O
every O
zoo O
kept O
the O
animals O
in O
perfect O
conditions O
, O
but O
regardless O
of O
the O
condition O
, O
zoos Arg-B
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
useful Arg-I
. O

Serious O
or O
entertaining O
movies O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
the Arg-I
serious Arg-I
movies Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
simple Arg-I
, Arg-I
touching Arg-I
and Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
. O

Here O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
most Arg-B
serious Arg-I
movies Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
content Arg-I
. O

Entertaining Arg-B
movies Arg-I
are Arg-I
created Arg-I
to Arg-I
amuse Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
most Arg-B
entertaining Arg-I
movies Arg-I
are Arg-I
empty Arg-I
and Arg-I
nonsensical Arg-I
. O

Compared Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
film Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
serious Arg-I
film Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
worthwhile Arg-I
and Arg-I
meaningful Arg-I
. O

Serious Arg-B
movies Arg-I
usually Arg-I
designed Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
one Arg-I
or Arg-I
more Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
about Arg-I
love Arg-I
, Arg-I
humaneness Arg-I
; O
moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
point Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
dark Arg-I
sides Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
not O
all O
of O
serious O
movies O
are O
boring O
. O

" Arg-B

Click Arg-I
" Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
comedy Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
serious Arg-I
approach Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
balanced Arg-I
life Arg-I
between Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
movie Arg-I
is Arg-I
humorous Arg-I
and Arg-I
satiric Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
reminds Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
important Arg-I
our Arg-I
families Arg-I
are Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
hidden Arg-I
meanings Arg-I
of Arg-I
serious Arg-I
movies Arg-I
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
beyond Arg-I
words Arg-I
and Arg-I
images Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
us Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
some Arg-B
of Arg-I
serious Arg-I
movies Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
you Arg-I

about Arg-I

In O
my O

disadvantages Arg-B
of Arg-I

personal Arg-I
lives Arg-I
of Arg-I
famous Arg-I

outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

My O
reasons O
include O
the O
following O
: O
It O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
media Arg-B
provide Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
an Arg-I
event Arg-I
that Arg-I
recently Arg-I
occurred Arg-I
somewhere Arg-I
and Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
essence Arg-I
of Arg-I
coverage Arg-I
accurate Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
gossip Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
journalism Arg-B
is Arg-I
changing Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
reporters Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
with Arg-I
gossip Arg-I
than Arg-I
news Arg-I
relating Arg-I
to Arg-I
public Arg-I
issues Arg-I
, Arg-I
paying Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
personal Arg-I
lives Arg-I
of Arg-I
famous Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
gossip Arg-B
involves Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
images Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
boosting Arg-I
newspaper Arg-I
sales Arg-I
or Arg-I
exciting Arg-I
public Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
audience Arg-I
may Arg-I
see Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
photos Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
reports Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
tell Arg-I
a Arg-I
story Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
ridiculous Arg-I
coverage Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
vexation Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
famous Arg-I

who Arg-I
are Arg-I
reported Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
sensationalism Arg-B
distract Arg-I
the Arg-I
viewers Arg-I

problems Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
media Arg-I
face Arg-I
the Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
that Arg-I

executives Arg-I
must Arg-I
choose Arg-I
the Arg-I
content Arg-I

which Arg-I
can Arg-I
attract Arg-I

Thus O
, O
these Arg-B

reports Arg-I
of Arg-I
famous Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
unimportant Arg-I
information Arg-I
or Arg-I
distorted Arg-I

In O

Based O
on O
the O
above O

a Arg-B
quintessence Arg-I

any Arg-I
visit Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
excellent Arg-I

the Arg-I

, O
which O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
following O

Primary O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I

Last Arg-B

the Arg-I

experience Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
New Arg-I
York Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
the Arg-I
exhibit Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
found Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
Statue Arg-I
of Arg-I
Liberty Arg-I
symbolized Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I

where Arg-I
the Arg-I

their Arg-I

Thus O
, O
museums Arg-B

help Arg-I
us Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
customs Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Secondary O
, O
visiting Arg-B
a Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
known Arg-I
museum Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
our Arg-I
horizon Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
outstanding Arg-I
and Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
objects Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
classic Arg-I
and Arg-I
magnificent Arg-I
art Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
guaranteed Arg-I
to Arg-I
inspire Arg-I
us Arg-I
! O

In Arg-B
my Arg-I
city Arg-I
, Arg-I
National Arg-I
Palace Arg-I
Museum Arg-I
is Arg-I
celebrated Arg-I
for Arg-I
collection Arg-I
of Arg-I
ancient Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
artifacts Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
my Arg-I
astonishment Arg-I
, Arg-I
Jadeite Arg-I
cabbage Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
famous Arg-I
artistic Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
made Arg-I
of Arg-I
jade Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
vividly Arg-I
shown Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
a Arg-B
local Arg-I
museum Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
top Arg-I
choice Arg-I
and Arg-I
destination Arg-I
for Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
. O

Someone Arg-B
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
trip Arg-I
without Arg-I
making Arg-I
any Arg-I
plans Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
waste Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
or Arg-I
staying Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
hotel Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
visiting Arg-B
a Arg-I
museum Arg-I
saves Arg-I
their Arg-I
precious Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
making Arg-I
a Arg-I
decision Arg-I
. O

Most O
important O
of O
all O
, O
a Arg-B
local Arg-I
museum Arg-I
represent Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
typical Arg-I
culture Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
may Arg-I
easily Arg-I
acquaint Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
if Arg-B
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
top Arg-I
museums Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
must Arg-I
stop Arg-I
by Arg-I
these Arg-I
museums Arg-I
. O

During O
our O
trip O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
worthwhile Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
a Arg-I
museum Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Study O
at O
home O
by O
using O
technology O
/ O
study O
or O
traditional O
school O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
technology Arg-I
can Arg-I
replace Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
. O

Here O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

Studying Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
biggest Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
your Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
and Arg-I
instructor Arg-I
are Arg-I
available Arg-I
24 Arg-I
hours Arg-I
a Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you Arg-B
could Arg-I
make Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
for Arg-I
completing Arg-I
the Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
any Arg-I
time Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
n't Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
dedicated Arg-I
or Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
time Arg-I
management Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
complete Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
attending Arg-B
an Arg-I
education Arg-I
course Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
requires Arg-I
persistence Arg-I
and Arg-I
patience Arg-I
. O

Especially O
when Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
instructor Arg-I
there Arg-I
to Arg-I
guide Arg-I
you Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
up Arg-I
to Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
understand Arg-I
and Arg-I
complete Arg-I
all Arg-I
course Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
may Arg-I
raise Arg-I
questions Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
of Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
some Arg-I
specific Arg-I
topics Arg-I
or Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
predicament Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
face Arg-I
some Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
studying Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
traditional Arg-I
classes Arg-I
, Arg-I
distance Arg-I
education Arg-I
courses Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
take Arg-I
place Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
surrounded Arg-I
by Arg-I
your Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
may Arg-I
find Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
without Arg-I
being Arg-I
kept Arg-I
under Arg-I
supervision Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
type Arg-I
that Arg-I
gets Arg-I
easily Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
distance Arg-I
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
program Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
for Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
school Arg-I
- Arg-I
socialization- Arg-I
establishes Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
with Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
from Arg-I
programs Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
our Arg-B
computers Arg-I
or Arg-I
televisions Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
may Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
with Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
from Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
. O

Studying Arg-B
alone Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
might Arg-I
deprive Arg-I
us Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
significant Arg-I
and Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
distance Arg-B
education Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
replace Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
build O
a O
large O
shopping O

in O
our O
community O

I O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

The O
following O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the Arg-B
establishment Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
will Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
residents Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
. O

Here O
is O
a O
positive O
example O
: O
Queens Arg-B
Center Arg-I
Mall Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
mall Arg-I
located Arg-I
in Arg-I
Queens Arg-I
borough Arg-I
of Arg-I
New Arg-I
York Arg-I
City Arg-I
, Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
vairtey Arg-I
of Arg-I
stores Arg-I
, Arg-I
products Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
clothing Arg-I
to Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
and Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
can Arg-I
choose Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
widely O
thought O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
productive Arg-I
malls Arg-I
in Arg-I
New Arg-I
York Arg-I
. O

I O
found O
that O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
find Arg-I
virtually Arg-I
every Arg-I
brand Arg-I
or Arg-I
store Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
Macy Arg-I
's Arg-I
and Arg-I
JCPenney Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
visited Arg-I
there Arg-I
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
mall Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
location Arg-I
for Arg-I
residents Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
shop Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
offer Arg-I
people Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
vacancies Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
opening Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
stores Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
mall Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
looking Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
full Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
retirees Arg-I
may Arg-I
work Arg-I
there Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
whiling Arg-I
away Arg-I
their Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
earning Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
goods Arg-I
in Arg-I
lower Arg-I
price Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
save Arg-I
our Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
hand Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
competition Arg-I
between Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
existing Arg-I
stores Arg-I
to Arg-I
attract Arg-I
the Arg-I
customers Arg-I
. O

Accordingly O
, O
with Arg-B
sales Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
for Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
to Arg-I
compare Arg-I
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
merchandise Arg-I
before Arg-I
they Arg-I
buy Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
residents Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
spending Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
commute Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
hope Arg-I
of Arg-I
setting Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
near Arg-I
their Arg-I
homes Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
, O
I Arg-B
advocate Arg-I
building Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
center Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
neighborhood Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
a O
very O
important O
skill O
a O
person O
should O
learn O
Some O
people O
think O
that O
life O
is O
a O
struggle O
, O
which O
means O
we O
may O
encounter O
numerous O
difficulties O
during O
our O
lives O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
stress Arg-B
management Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
survive Arg-I
our Arg-I
unbearable Arg-I
stress Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
skill Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
. O

Here O
are O
my O
reasons O
. O

Stress Arg-B
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
body Arg-I
's Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
responding Arg-I
to Arg-I
any Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
demand Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
both Arg-I
good Arg-I
and Arg-I
bad Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

Stress Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
mobilization Arg-I
to Arg-I
drive Arg-I
for Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
widely Arg-I
thought Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
experience Arg-I
stress Arg-I
any Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
comes Arg-I
across Arg-I
unexpectedly Arg-I
that Arg-I
frustrates Arg-I
our Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
if Arg-B
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
stress Arg-I
management Arg-I
skill Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
critical Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
frenetic Arg-I
, Arg-I
fast Arg-I
- Arg-I
paced Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
common Arg-I
predicament Arg-I
that Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
senior Arg-I
, Arg-I
feel Arg-I
depressed Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
stress Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
financial Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
exam Arg-I
stress Arg-I
, Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
overload Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
people Arg-I
regard Arg-I
stress Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
power Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
overcomes Arg-I
the Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
to Arg-I
motivate Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
; O
other Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
charge Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
, Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
they Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
stress Arg-B
management Arg-I
recently Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
significant Arg-I
issue Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
realization Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
stress Arg-B
takes Arg-I
a Arg-I
toll Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
known Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
frequently Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
hassles Arg-I
, Arg-I
frustrations Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
demands Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
why Arg-I
people Arg-I
were Arg-I
overwhelmed Arg-I
by Arg-I
constant Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
physical Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
insomnia Arg-I
and Arg-I
headaches Arg-I
. O

Melancholia Arg-B
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
fatal Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
leads Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
commit Arg-I
suicide Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
and Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
stress Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
goal Arg-I
of Arg-I
balancing Arg-I
our Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
body Arg-I
. O

To O
avoid O
being O
a O
pessimist O
, O
we O
may O
try O
to O
conquer O
our O
distress O
by O
sharing O
our O
worry O
with O
friends O
or O
families O
, O
doing O
exercise O
regularly O
, O
and O
trying O
to O
see O
our O
troubles O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
stress Arg-B
management Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
skill Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
find Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
their Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

Establishing O
a O
new O
university O
in O
your O
community O
I Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
to Arg-I
hear Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
plan Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
university Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
setting Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
creation Arg-I
of Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
they O
come O
together O
with O
some O
disadvantages O
such O
as O
social O
problems O
. O

This Arg-B
new Arg-I
university Arg-I
will Arg-I
allow Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
community Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
suppose Arg-B
you Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
faraway Arg-I
community Arg-I
where Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
single Arg-I
university Arg-I
and Arg-I
you Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
your Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
a Arg-I
business Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
across Arg-I
the Arg-I

get Arg-I

He Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
business Arg-I
school Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
proposed Arg-I
community Arg-I
's Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
the Arg-B
university Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
hire Arg-I
professors Arg-I
, Arg-I
employees Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
a Arg-B
number Arg-I
vacant Arg-I
positions Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
filled Arg-I
. O

Also O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
when Arg-B
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
on Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
stimulate Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
building Arg-B
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
may Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
then Arg-I
may Arg-I
come Arg-I
from Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
communities Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
in Arg-I
to Arg-I
or Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
congregate Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
some Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
will Arg-I
follow Arg-I
. O

Traffic Arg-B
may Arg-I
worsen Arg-I
. O

More Arg-B
wastes Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
managed Arg-I
. O

Maybe Arg-B
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
increase Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
may Arg-I
impair Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I Arg-B
myself Arg-I
agree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
plan Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
the Arg-B
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
cost Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it O
would O
be O
indispensable O
that O
the O
government O
conduct O
a O
survey O
about O
the O
community O
opinion O
on O
the O
new O
university O
first O
. O

Television O
versus O
Friends O
and O
family O

We O
all O
know O
that O
television O
provides O
us O
many O
benefits O
; O
it O
helps O
people O
relax O
, O
helps O
keep O
up O
with O
news O
, O
helps O
broad O
our O
mind O
. O

However O
, O
have O
you O
ever O
thought O
that O
television O
has O
destroyed O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
family O
? O

I Arg-B
personally Arg-I
consider Arg-I
this Arg-I
fact Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
television Arg-I
has Arg-I
brought Arg-I
upon Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
since O
people Arg-B
watch Arg-I
television Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
isolated Arg-I
from Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
movies Arg-I
, Arg-I
music Arg-I
show Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
else Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
school Arg-I
or Arg-I
practicing Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
apart Arg-I
by Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

Gradually Arg-B
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
leave Arg-I
them Arg-I
behind Arg-I
either Arg-I
activities Arg-I
or Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
rapid Arg-I
change Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
each Arg-I
family Arg-I
has Arg-I
three Arg-I
or Arg-I
four Arg-I
TV Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
room Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
common Arg-I
. O

Parents Arg-B
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
children Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
room Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
children Arg-B
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
from Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
see Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
not Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
function Arg-I
their Arg-I
parental Arg-I
care Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
thing Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
communication Arg-B
between Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
is Arg-I
visibly Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
watching Arg-B
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
television Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
unconsciously Arg-I
learn Arg-I
bad Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
that Arg-I
sow Arg-I
division Arg-I
among Arg-I
human Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
watching Arg-B
film Arg-I
about Arg-I
terrorist Arg-I
children Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
terrorism Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
right Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

What O
happens O
if O
they O
do O
act O

exactly O
the O
terrorist O
in O
Hollywood O
movies O
does O
? O
is O
this O
one O
of O
the O
reason O
cause O
division O
in O
society O
? O

In O
conclusion O
, O
though O
television Arg-B
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
good Arg-I
sides Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
communication Arg-I
among Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

We O
need O
to O
quickly O
find O
the O
way O
to O
address O
this O
problem O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
and O
the O
first O
concern O
is O
to O
reducing O
violent O
behaviors O
that O
children O
learn O
from O
television O
. O

Live O

If O
you O
have O
a O
great O
love O
with O

your O

, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
gratifying Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
side Arg-I
by Arg-I
side Arg-I
and Arg-I
cheer Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
team Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
just Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
and Arg-I
watch Arg-I
the Arg-I
match Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
attending Arg-B
a Arg-I
live Arg-I
football Arg-I
match Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
fulfilling Arg-I
. O

Before Arg-B
the Arg-I
match Arg-I
starts Arg-I
, Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
fans Arg-I
gathering Arg-I
outside Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I

with Arg-I

colorful Arg-I
outfits Arg-I

sound Arg-I
of Arg-I

... O
everywhere O

As Arg-B
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
kicks Arg-I
off Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
inside Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
is Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
exciting Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
football Arg-I
stars Arg-I
play Arg-I
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
with Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
and Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
your Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
with Arg-I
about Arg-I
40,000 Arg-I
people Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
an Arg-I
excitement Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
have Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
it Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Everybody Arg-B
yells Arg-I
and Arg-I
sings Arg-I
together Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
is Arg-I
like Arg-I
bursted Arg-I
out Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
a Arg-I
goal Arg-I
is Arg-I
scored Arg-I
. O

See Arg-B
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
bored Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
it Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
watching Arg-B
a Arg-I
live Arg-I
football Arg-I
game Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
exceptional Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
watch Arg-I
it Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
" Arg-I
easy Arg-I
come Arg-I
, Arg-I
easy Arg-I
go Arg-I
" Arg-I

, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
forget Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
movie Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
tickets Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
little Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
, O
but O
you Arg-B
will Arg-I
gain Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
value Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
game Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
cherish Arg-I
your Arg-I
experience Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
exclusive Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
win Arg-I
to Arg-I
acclaim Arg-I
a Arg-I
trophy Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
" Arg-I
on Arg-I

" Arg-I
to Arg-I
witness Arg-I
and Arg-I
celebrate Arg-I
the Arg-I
victory Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
watch Arg-B
a Arg-I
football Arg-I
match Arg-I
on Arg-I
television Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
and Arg-I
pleasing Arg-I
, O
but O
watching Arg-B
the Arg-I
match Arg-I
live Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
stadium Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B

unforgettable Arg-I

Fossil O

? O

Although O
renewable O
resources O
of O
energy O
are O
elements O
of O
the O
current O
and O
future O
energy O
strategy O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
, O
these O
new Arg-B
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
soon Arg-I
replace Arg-I
fossil Arg-I
fuels Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
gases Arg-I
, Arg-I
oil Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
coal Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
due Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
limitation Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
relatively Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
. O

Researches Arg-B
in Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
energy Arg-I
cost Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
which Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
fossil Arg-B
fuels Arg-I
are Arg-I
abundant Arg-I
and Arg-I
inexpensive Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
estimated Arg-I
that Arg-I
China Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
largest Arg-I
deposit Arg-I
of Arg-I
coal Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
new Arg-I
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
, Arg-I
say Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
solar Arg-I
batteries Arg-I
and Arg-I
wind Arg-I
farms Arg-I
. O

Thus O
the Arg-B
plan Arg-I
of Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
resources Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
may Arg-I
face Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
not Arg-I
every Arg-I
country Arg-I
can Arg-I
afford Arg-I
the Arg-I
reforming Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
although O
utility Arg-B
companies Arg-I
claim Arg-I
that Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
energy Arg-I
is Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
; O
these Arg-B
new Arg-I
forms Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
as Arg-I
clean Arg-I
and Arg-I
green Arg-I
as Arg-I
we Arg-I
think Arg-I
. O

Latest Arg-B
studies Arg-I
have Arg-I
shown Arg-I
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
resources Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
are Arg-I
problematic Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
pose Arg-I
long Arg-I
- Arg-I
term Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
hazards Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
dams Arg-I
built Arg-I
for Arg-I
hydroelectricity Arg-I
influence Arg-I
the Arg-I
water Arg-I
flows Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
rivers Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
cause Arg-I
drought Arg-I
in Arg-I
areas Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
dams Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
damages Arg-I
the Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
fish Arg-I
and Arg-I
wading Arg-I
birds Arg-I
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the Arg-B
accumulation Arg-I
of Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
metal Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
silt Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
bottom Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
rivers Arg-I
behind Arg-I
the Arg-I
dams Arg-I
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
and Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
up Arg-I
; Arg-I
leaving Arg-I
problems Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
following Arg-I
generations Arg-I
. O

Thus O
renewable Arg-B
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
as Arg-I
reliable Arg-I
as Arg-I
we Arg-I
think Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
contemporarily Arg-B
fossil Arg-I
fuels Arg-I
cause Arg-I
serious Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
conundrums Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
acid Arg-I
rain Arg-I
, Arg-I
deduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
ozone Arg-I
layer Arg-I
and Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
; O
these Arg-B
problems Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
solved Arg-I
by Arg-I
improving Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
mechanism Arg-I
and Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
chemicals Arg-I
to Arg-I
desulfurize Arg-I
the Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
from Arg-I
plants Arg-I
and Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
acid Arg-I
rain Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
improving Arg-I
methods Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
and Arg-I
simpler Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
of Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
energy Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
these Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
fossil Arg-I
fuels Arg-I
seem Arg-I
more Arg-I
sustainable Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
as O
promising O
as O
renewable O
resources O
of O
energy O
sound O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
way Arg-I
those Arg-I
new Arg-I

. O

First O
, O
land Arg-B
used Arg-I
for Arg-I
farmland Arg-I

the Arg-I

because O
they Arg-B

What O
is O
more O
, O
the Arg-B
society Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
stable Arg-I

due Arg-I
to Arg-I

the Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
and Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

Thus O
the Arg-B
needs Arg-I
for Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
farmland Arg-B
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
can Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
the Arg-I
desire Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
that Arg-I
living Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
understood O
that O
farming Arg-B
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
provide Arg-I
us Arg-I
the Arg-I
food Arg-I
we Arg-I
eat Arg-I
, Arg-I
place Arg-I
we Arg-I
live Arg-I
, Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
we Arg-I
wear Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
. O

Especially Arg-B
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
poor Arg-I
areas Arg-I
, Arg-I
survival Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
significant Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
highly Arg-B
developed Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
our Arg-I
living Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
which Arg-I
allow Arg-I
us Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
quality Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Last O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
is O
that O
even O
though O
farmland Arg-B
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
will Arg-I
occupy Arg-I
the Arg-I
land Arg-I
used Arg-I
for Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

According O
to O
the O
discuss O
above O
, O
agriculture Arg-B
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

With O
the O
economy O
development O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
methods Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

For O
instant O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
invent Arg-I
new Arg-I
technique Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
to Arg-I
produce Arg-I
offspring Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
sure Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
distinct Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
protecting Arg-B
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
, O
nevertheless O
, O
human Arg-B
needs Arg-I
for Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
, Arg-I
housing Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Physical O
exercise O
should O
be O
required O
part O
of O
every O
school O
day O

Although O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
students O
should O
spend O
the O
whole O
day O
on O
academic O
studies O
, O
I O
nevertheless O
believe O
that O
physical Arg-B
exercise Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
every Arg-I
school Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

Exercise Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
body Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
including Arg-B
exercise Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
daily Arg-I
routine Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
from Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

Physical Arg-B
activity Arg-I
helps Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
physically Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
. O

As O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
the Arg-B
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
obesity Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
has Arg-I
increased Arg-I
every Arg-I
year Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
daily Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
break Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
several Arg-I
hours Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
exercise Arg-B
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
illness Arg-I
related Arg-I
with Arg-I
cardiovascular Arg-I
, Arg-I
higher Arg-I
blood Arg-I
and Arg-I
cholesterol Arg-I
issues Arg-I
. O

Daily Arg-B
exercise Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
also Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
brain Arg-I
function Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
well Arg-I
known Arg-I
how Arg-I
important Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
regularly Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
body Arg-I
system Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
respiratory Arg-I
system Arg-I
's Arg-I
function Arg-I
is Arg-I
enhanced Arg-I
, Arg-I
helping Arg-I
all Arg-I
organs Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
the Arg-I
brain Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
oxygen Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

Daily Arg-B
exercise Arg-I
will Arg-I
provide Arg-I
children Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
mental Arg-I
break Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
boost Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
children Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
daily Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
routine Arg-I
from Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
will Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
important Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
having Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
routine Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
are Arg-I
bombarded Arg-I
with Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
about Arg-I
nutrition Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
; Arg-I
however Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
beneficed Arg-I
if Arg-I
that Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
in Arg-I
practice Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
stick Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
routine Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
daily Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
habit Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Including Arg-B
physical Arg-I
activity Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
school Arg-I
day Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
considered Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
meliorate Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
mental Arg-I
and Arg-I
body Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
will Arg-I
establish Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
a Arg-I
habit Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
giving Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
measure Arg-I
the Arg-I
worth Arg-I
of Arg-I
including Arg-I
such Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
activity Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
daily Arg-I
live Arg-I
schedules Arg-I
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
good O
for O
teenagers O
to O
work O
while O
schooling O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
for Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
job Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Although O
, O
many Arg-B
argue Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
provide Arg-I
good Arg-I
working Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
interfere Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
jobs Arg-I
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
divert Arg-I
their Arg-I
mind Arg-I
from Arg-I
studies Arg-I
and Arg-I
would Arg-I
take Arg-I
away Arg-I
their Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
phase Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
student Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
studies Arg-I
in Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
world Arg-I
to Arg-I
prove Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
his Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
grades Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
get Arg-I
involved Arg-I
himself Arg-I
in Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
rest Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
cause Arg-I
an Arg-I
extra Arg-I
burden Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
jobs Arg-B
has Arg-I
various Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
like Arg-I
attendance Arg-I
, Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
extra Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
would Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
stress Arg-I
, Arg-I
tension Arg-I
and Arg-I
tiredness Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
proper Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
relaxation Arg-I
, Arg-I
sleep Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
would Arg-B
affect Arg-I
their Arg-I
mental Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
, O
jobs Arg-B
can Arg-I
divert Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
students Arg-I
started Arg-I
earning Arg-I
in Arg-I
earlier Arg-I
age Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
attracted Arg-I
towards Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
feel Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
more Arg-I
for Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
loose Arg-I
their Arg-I
interest Arg-I
from Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
drop Arg-I
out Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
the Arg-B
main Arg-I
drawback Arg-I
of Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
miss Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
fun Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
would Arg-I
miss Arg-I
various Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
hang Arg-I
out Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
clubs Arg-I
and Arg-I
fun Arg-I
activities Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
prove Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
the Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
phase Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
return Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
possible Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
for Arg-B
a Arg-I
teenager Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
job Arg-I
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
divert Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
studies Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
away Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
important Arg-I
phase Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Do O
zoos O
serve O
any O
useful O
function O
? O

It O
has O
become O
quite O
a O
common O
hobby O
of O
children O
that O
they O
usually O
spend O
their O
free O
time O
in O
zoos O
. O

Zoos O
have O
been O
established O
for O
ages O
all O
over O
the O
world O
and O
have O
become O
interesting O
places O
for O
entertainment O
. O

Over O
the O
time O
, O
there O
are O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
arguments O
concerning O
whether O
zoos O
are O
helpful O
in O
serving O
people O
or O
they O
are O
just O
some O
kinds O
of O
bad O
treatments O
to O
animals O
. O

Some O
people O
spot O
out O
that O
humanities Arg-B
benefit Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
from Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
zoos Arg-B
are Arg-I
fascinating Arg-I
places Arg-I
of Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
. O

For O
this O
point O
, O
they O
all O
think O
that O
the Arg-B
very Arg-I
nature Arg-I
and Arg-I
wildness Arg-I
are Arg-I
all Arg-I
brought Arg-I
into Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
and Arg-I
spending Arg-I
time Arg-I
there Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
forget Arg-I
all Arg-I
stress Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
. O

Another O
function O
that O
all Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
serve Arg-I
relates Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
students Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
people Arg-I
find Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
as Arg-I
good Arg-I
places Arg-I
for Arg-I
witnessing Arg-I
and Arg-I
researching Arg-I
the Arg-I
true Arg-I
animal Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
some Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
reservation Arg-I
sites Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
animals Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
about Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
, O
however O
, O
people O
who O
think O
that O
zoos Arg-B
just Arg-I
take Arg-I
away Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
confined Arg-I
, Arg-I
animals Arg-I
may Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
nature Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
wildness Arg-I
and Arg-I
feel Arg-I
upset Arg-I
and Arg-I
discontented Arg-I
. O

In O
their O
opinion O
, O
zoos Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
prisons Arg-I

and Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
so Arg-I
cruel Arg-I
and Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
animal Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
prisons Arg-I
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
first O
group O
. O

In Arg-B
modern Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
have Arg-I
become Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
serving Arg-I
as Arg-I
places Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
destruction Arg-I
is Arg-I
made Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
towers Arg-I
and Arg-I
skyscrapers Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
recently Arg-B
, Arg-I
zookeepers Arg-I
have Arg-I
also Arg-I
tried Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
animals Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
by Arg-I
making Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
landscapes Arg-I
more Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
, Arg-I
taking Arg-I
care Arg-I
all Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
both Arg-I
feeding Arg-I
and Arg-I
sanity Arg-I
. O

Studying O
alone O
or O
in O
a O
group O

When O
I O
found O
the O
chance O
of O
studying O
in O
a O
group O
with O
my O
classmates O
, O
I O
wished O
I O
can O
go O
back O
in O
time O
and O
took O
all O
my O
exams O
again O
. O

I Arg-B
personally Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
noticeable Arg-I
features Arg-I
, Arg-I
getting Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
improving Arg-I
my Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
managing Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
effective Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
pupils Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
for Arg-I
studying Arg-I
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
member Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
together Arg-I
for Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
the Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
faces Arg-I
with Arg-I
complex Arg-I
math Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
opinions Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
such Arg-B
a Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
effect Arg-I
has Arg-I
incorporation Arg-I
that Arg-I
all Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
weak Arg-I
points Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

Increasing Arg-B
the Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
and Arg-I
competence Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
are Arg-I
another Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
- Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
student Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
always Arg-I
encourages Arg-I
others Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
harder Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
pupils Arg-B
often Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
tangible Arg-I
competence Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
highest Arg-I
grade Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

Clearly O
, O
better Arg-B
learning Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
noticeable Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
competences Arg-I
and Arg-I
encouragements Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
study Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
effective Arg-I
manner Arg-I
. O

Group Arg-B
- Arg-I
studying Arg-I
causes Arg-I
some Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
internal Arg-I
obligation Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
inasmuch Arg-I
as Arg-I
we Arg-I
always Arg-I
care Arg-I
about Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I

and Arg-I
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
waste Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
time Arg-B
management Arg-I
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
- Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
strongly Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
important Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
receive Arg-I
some Arg-I
helps Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
student Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
improving Arg-I
my Arg-I
learning Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
managing Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
- Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Now O
, O
it O
is O
time O
to O
start O
without O
any O
regret O
from O
my O
previous O
exams O
. O

Should O
animals O
be O
free O
or O
live O
in O
zoos O
? O

Many O
people O
state O
that O
zoos O
are O
a O
great O
asset O
to O
animals O
. O

Others O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
inferior O
creatures O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
deserve O
our O
attention O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we Arg-B
must Arg-I
help Arg-I
animals Arg-I
live Arg-I
safely Arg-I
and Arg-I
comfortably Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
scientific Arg-I
studies Arg-I
have Arg-I
revealed Arg-I
the Arg-I
detriment Arg-I
that Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
have Arg-I
caused Arg-I
to Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
like Arg-B
we Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
, Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
delivered Arg-I
to Arg-I
this Arg-I
world Arg-I
with Arg-I
genetic Arg-I
instincts Arg-I
. O

Skills O
which O
help O
them O
live O
and O
survive O
in O
their O
residing O
areas O
. O

When Arg-B
we Arg-I
captivate Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
put Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
style Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
unfamiliar Arg-I
with Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
begin Arg-I
to Arg-I
loose Arg-I
those Arg-I
in Arg-I
- Arg-I
born Arg-I
instincts Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
released Arg-I
or Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
worst Arg-I
case Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
escape Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
act Arg-I
disorientated Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
animal Arg-I
mortality Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
previous O
point O
, O
various Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
proper Arg-I
implements Arg-I
or Arg-I
policies Arg-I
that Arg-I
assure Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
animal Arg-I
care Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I O
recall O
my O
first O
trip O
to O
a O
zoo O
, O
at O
age O
eight O
. O

I Arg-B
was Arg-I
shocked Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
cruelty Arg-I
which Arg-I
animals Arg-I
were Arg-I
treated Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
think Arg-I
of Arg-I
any Arg-I
staff Arg-I
memeber Arg-I
who Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
improper Arg-I
behaviour Arg-I
towards Arg-I
the Arg-I
animlas Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
beat Arg-I
them Arg-I
up Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
eat Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
excused Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
saying Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
train Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
we Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
assit Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
provide Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

Scientific Arg-B
facts Arg-I
showed Arg-I
the Arg-I
damage Arg-I
that Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
can Arg-I
inflict Arg-I
on Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
many Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
standards Arg-I
of Arg-I
care Arg-I
required Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

A O
university O
plans O
to O
devlope O
a O
new O
research O
centre O
in O
your O
country O
Most O
of O
the O
universities O
in O
the O
world O
seek O
to O
develop O
some O
research O
in O
some O
countries O
. O

These O
researches O
can O
be O
aimed O
for O
several O
fields O
such O
as O
business O
or O
agriculture O
. O

If Arg-B
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
plans Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
research Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
between Arg-I
establishing Arg-I
a Arg-I
centre Arg-I
for Arg-I
business Arg-I
research Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
centre Arg-I
for Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
opt Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
second Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
my Arg-B
country Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
land Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
lands Arg-I
are Arg-I
left Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
centre Arg-I
for Arg-I
research Arg-I
in Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
my Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
exploit Arg-I
these Arg-I
land Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
centre Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
there Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
their Arg-I
issues Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
land Arg-I
. O

Especially Arg-B
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
or Arg-I
education Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
centre Arg-I
for Arg-I
research Arg-I
in Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
helps Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
agriculture Arg-I
field Arg-I
has Arg-I
only Arg-I
thirty Arg-I
percent Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
market Arg-I
part Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
centre Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
can Arg-I
raise Arg-I
the Arg-I
market Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
field Arg-I
by Arg-I
developing Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
products Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
dates Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
product Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
centre Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
for Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
some Arg-I
research Arg-I
in Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
product Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
treat Arg-I
the Arg-I
Palme Arg-I
and Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
treat Arg-I
the Arg-I
land Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
palms Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
reason Arg-I
that Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
centre Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
centre Arg-I
of Arg-I
business Arg-I
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
showing Arg-B
people Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
exploit Arg-I
a Arg-I
land Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
good Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
products Arg-I
will Arg-I
push Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
business Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
field Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
a Arg-B
centre Arg-I
of Arg-I
business Arg-I
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
because O
we Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
parallel Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
countries Arg-I
which Arg-I
have Arg-I
focused Arg-I
in Arg-I
business Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

For O
me O
being Arg-B
a Arg-I
developed Arg-I
country Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
business Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
what Arg-I
really Arg-I
bring Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
self Arg-I
satisfaction Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
for Arg-I
our Arg-I
country Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
country Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
more Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
by Arg-I
establishing Arg-I
centers Arg-I
for Arg-I
research Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
field Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
very Arg-I
positive Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
on Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
people Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
and Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
employment Arg-I
. O

People O
learn O
in O
different O
ways O
and O
what O
teaching O
method O
do O
you O
prefer O
? O

People O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
to O
learn O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
use O
several O
ways O
to O
broaden O
their O
knowledge O
and O
their O
skills O
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
several Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
is Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
my Arg-I
self Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
reading Arg-I
about Arg-I
things Arg-I
or Arg-I
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
talking Arg-I
about Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
to O
recommend O
this O
method O
for O
who O
is O
serious O
about O
learning O
some O
thing O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
learning Arg-B
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
develops Arg-I
our Arg-I
maturity Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
your Arg-I
self Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
refer Arg-I
to Arg-I
books Arg-I
or Arg-I
persons Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
fact Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
some Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
strong Arg-I
our Arg-I
maturity Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
if Arg-B
some Arg-I
one Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
leader Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
experience Arg-I
this Arg-I
by Arg-I
being Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
real Arg-I
situation Arg-I
of Arg-I
leading Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
a Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
leaders Arg-I
by Arg-I
reading Arg-I
books Arg-I
or Arg-I
by Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
person Arg-I
talking Arg-I
about Arg-I
leading Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
learning Arg-B
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
exciting Arg-I
than Arg-I
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
reading Arg-I
about Arg-I
things Arg-I
or Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
talking Arg-I
about Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
that Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
learnt Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Reading Arg-B
about Arg-I
things Arg-I
or Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
talking Arg-I
about Arg-I
can Arg-I
rarely Arg-I
submit Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
sensation Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
excitement Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
swim Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
beach Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
swimpool Arg-I
and Arg-I
laid Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
water Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
and Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
. O

Nor Arg-B
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
or Arg-I
reading Arg-I
about Arg-I
can Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
that O
makes O
learning O
by O
doing O
things O
more O
advantageous O
than O
learning O
by O
reading O
about O
things O
or O
listening O
to O
people O
talking O
about O
is O
that O
we Arg-B
find Arg-I
more Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
to Arg-I
continuing Arg-I
on Arg-I
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
Reading Arg-I
about Arg-I
things Arg-I
or Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
talking Arg-I
about Arg-I
could Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
boring Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
especially Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
this Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

So O
we Arg-B
become Arg-I
motivated Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
other Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

The O
history O
shows O
that O
learning Arg-B
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
method Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

People O
should O
not O
depend O
only O
on O
reading O
or O
listening O
to O
people O
talking O
about O
things O
to O
learn O
. O

They O
should O
try O
and O
keep O
trying O
until O
they O
learn O
what O
they O
want O
to O
learn O
. O

Cheap O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
encouraged O
? O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
many O
airlines O
offer O
to O
their O
customers O
more O
and O
more O
number O
of O
cheap O
flights O
. O

People O
have O
various O
different O
views O
about O
cheap O
air O
travel O
. O

Although O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
arguments Arg-I
in Arg-I
favour Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
trend Arg-I
should O
be O
encouraged O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
that O
cheap Arg-B
flight Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
many Arg-I
serious Arg-I
problem Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
cheap Arg-B
air Arg-I
fares Arg-I
have Arg-I
broadened Arg-I
travel Arg-I
possibilities Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
lower Arg-I
income Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
millions Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
travel Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
for Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
careers Arg-I
, Arg-I
broad Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
varied Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
backgrounds Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
travels Arg-B
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I

, Arg-I
boost Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
and Arg-I
job Arg-I
markets Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
growing Arg-B
of Arg-I
cheap Arg-I
flights Arg-I
really Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
more Arg-B
flights Arg-I
could Arg-I
mean Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
and Arg-I
busier Arg-I
airport Arg-I
that Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
grown Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
close Arg-I
to Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
biggest Arg-I
concern Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
. O

Burning Arg-B
plane Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
can Arg-I
releases Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
into Arg-I
environment Arg-I
that Arg-I
cause Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
to Arg-I
heat Arg-I
up Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
while Arg-B
many Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
are Arg-I
being Arg-I
made Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
CO2 Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
from Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
factories Arg-I
, Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
is Arg-I
being Arg-I
done Arg-I
to Arg-I
reins Arg-I
the Arg-I
airlines Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
the Arg-B
drawbacks Arg-I
of Arg-I
cheap Arg-I
air Arg-I
fares Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
air O
travel O
should O
be O
more O
expensive O
. O

Instead O
, O
people O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
their O
responsibility O
to O
reduce O
the O
emissions O
caused O
by O
their O
lifestyle O
choices O
. O

Improve O
roads O
or O
public O
transports O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
governments O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
improving O
roads O
and O
highways O
while O
the O
others O
say O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
public O
transportation O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
system Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
problems Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
rising Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
is Arg-I
creating Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
the Arg-B
using Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
reduces Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
resources Arg-I
using Arg-I
on Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
. O

Cars Arg-B
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
renewable Arg-I
resource Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
cars Arg-I
we Arg-I
use Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
faster Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
used Arg-I
up Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
contrary O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
used Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
per Arg-I
person Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
much Arg-I
lower Arg-I
. O

And O
this Arg-B
definitely Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
reserve Arg-I
our Arg-I
invaluable Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resource Arg-I
, Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
public Arg-B
transportation Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Averagely O
, O
public Arg-B
transports Arg-I
use Arg-I
much Arg-I
less Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
to Arg-I
carry Arg-I
people Arg-I
than Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
public Arg-I
transports Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
less Arg-I
gas Arg-I
exhaust Arg-I
is Arg-I
pumped Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
bear Arg-I
the Arg-I
stuffy Arg-I
situation Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
fumes Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
using Arg-B
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
safer Arg-I
than Arg-I
private Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
. O

According Arg-B
to Arg-I
National Arg-I
Safety Arg-I
Council Arg-I
, Arg-I
riding Arg-I
the Arg-I
bus Arg-I
is Arg-I
over Arg-I
170 Arg-I
times Arg-I
safer Arg-I
than Arg-I
private Arg-I
care Arg-I
. O

Thus O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
reason Arg-I
that Arg-I
governments Arg-I
should Arg-I
hesitate Arg-I
to Arg-I
invest Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
, Arg-I
safe Arg-I
and Arg-I
economical Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
transporting Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
can O
say O
for O
certain O
that O
spending Arg-B
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
improving Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
key Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
our Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
creating Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
and Arg-I
safe Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
Earth O
is O
being O
harmed O
by O
human O
Whether O
human O
activity O
is O
making O
the O
Earth O
a O
better O
place O
to O
live O
or O
damaging O
it O
is O
a O
debatable O
issue O
. O

Some O
people O
advocate O
the O
idea O
that O
human O
activity O
is O
advantageously O
influencing O
to O
the O
Earth O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
human Arg-B
activities Arg-I
are Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
effect Arg-I
upon Arg-I
our Arg-I
planet Arg-I
, O
for O
human Arg-B
are Arg-I
polluting Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
's Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
exhausting Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resource Arg-I
and Arg-I
threatening Arg-I
the Arg-I
living Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
species Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
are Arg-I
corrupting Arg-I
their Arg-I
ecosphere Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
recent Arg-I
decades Arg-I
, Arg-I
concurrently Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
increase Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
consume Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
waste Arg-I
discarded Arg-I
by Arg-I
human Arg-I
also Arg-I
multiplies Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
wastes Arg-I
including Arg-I
household Arg-I
waste Arg-I
and Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
waste Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
big Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
" Arg-I
new Arg-I
" Arg-I
continent Arg-I
is Arg-I
now Arg-I
being Arg-I
formed Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
sea Arg-I
from Arg-I
garbage Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
industrial Arg-I
exhaust Arg-I
gases Arg-I
are Arg-I
adulterating Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
, Arg-I
causing Arg-I
the Arg-I
insalubrious Arg-I
phenomenon Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
acid Arg-I
rain Arg-I
, Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
or Arg-I
climate Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
draining Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
's Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
resources Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
oil Arg-I
, Arg-I
coal Arg-I
are Arg-I
vital Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
activity Arg-I
, O
therefore O
nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
exploitation Arg-I
activities Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
infinite Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Researchers Arg-B
indicated Arg-I
that Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
un Arg-I
- Arg-I
recyclable Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
several Arg-I
decades Arg-I
after Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
's Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
are Arg-I
totally Arg-I
exhausted Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
that Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
activity Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
affected Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
dependence Arg-I
on Arg-I
these Arg-I
resources Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
endangering Arg-I
other Arg-I
species Arg-I
' Arg-I
live Arg-I
. O

Hunting Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
activity Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
for Arg-I
having Arg-I
food Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
million Arg-I
years Arg-I
of Arg-I
hunting Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
recent Arg-I
centuries Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
innovation Arg-I
of Arg-I
rifle Arg-I
and Arg-I
dynamite Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
killed Arg-I
many Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
have Arg-I
made Arg-I
some Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
become Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
people Arg-B
, Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
population Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
expanding Arg-I
their Arg-I
living Arg-I
area Arg-I
; O
consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
living Arg-I
area Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
species Arg-I
narrowed Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
narrowing Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
region Arg-I
is Arg-I
pushing Arg-I
many Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
brink Arg-I
of Arg-I
extinction Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
from O
discussed O
reasons O
, O
we O
can O
conclude O
that O
human Arg-B
activity Arg-I
are Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
destroy Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
since O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
polluting Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
depleting Arg-I
the Arg-I
resource Arg-I
and Arg-I
imperiling Arg-I

Spending O
money O
on O

If O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
help O
a O
company O
make O
a O
decision O
on O
spending O
money O
either O
on O
supporting O
the O

or O
helping O
the O
environment O
, O
I O
would O
choose O
the O
latter O
without O
hesitation O
for O
the O
reasons O
below O
. O

First O
, O
conservation Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
urgent Arg-I
now Arg-I
than Arg-I
at Arg-I
any Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
history Arg-I
. O

According Arg-B
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
statistic Arg-I
conducted Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
International Arg-I
Animal Arg-I
Preserving Arg-I
Association Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
only Arg-I
ten Arg-I
percent Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
animals Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
ever Arg-I
existed Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
biodiversity Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
grievously Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
rising Arg-B
sea Arg-I
levels Arg-I
, Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
reached Arg-I
a Arg-I
level Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
threatening Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
continue Arg-I
discharging Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
with Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I
nations Arg-I
like Arg-I
Japan Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
submerged Arg-I
and Arg-I
weather Arg-I
patterns Arg-I
could Arg-I
change Arg-I
, Arg-I
causing Arg-I
flooding Arg-I
, Arg-I
drought Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
an Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
damaging Arg-I
storms Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
the Arg-B
ecosystem Arg-I
is Arg-I
in Arg-I
its Arg-I
worst Arg-I
condition Arg-I
ever Arg-I
and Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
did Arg-I
n't Arg-I
take Arg-I
harsh Arg-I
measures Arg-I
now Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
never Arg-I
will Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
supporting Arg-B
environment Arg-I
protection Arg-I
will Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
, O
an Arg-B
increasing Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
conservation Arg-I
; O
therefore O
, O
sponsoring Arg-B
conservation Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

Just Arg-B
imagine Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
your Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
sponsoring Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
improves Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
your Arg-I
company Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
known Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
company Arg-I
and Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
consumer Arg-I
- Arg-I
oriented Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
conservation Arg-B
leads Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

I O
confess O
that O
art Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
, O
but O
, O
with Arg-B
exhaust Arg-I
fumes Arg-I
and Arg-I
acid Arg-I
rain Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
energy Arg-I
and Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
to Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
the Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
or Arg-I
photographs Arg-I
. O

Biodiversity Arg-B
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
nature Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
results Arg-I
of Arg-I
abetter Arg-I
environment Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
necessities Arg-I
of Arg-I
photography Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
although O
supporting Arg-B
art Arg-I
will Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
the Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
in Arg-I
short Arg-I
- Arg-I
term Arg-I

, O
I Arg-B
still Arg-I

Luck O
vs O
hard O
work O

There O
are O
many O
instances O
that O
luck O
has O
brought O
people O
things O
that O
they O
never O
could O
even O
imagine O
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
see Arg-I
any Arg-I
rational Arg-I
in Arg-I
believing Arg-I
in Arg-I
luck Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
the O
argument O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
that Arg-I
helps Arg-I
him Arg-I
reach Arg-I
his Arg-I
target Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
depend Arg-I
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
luck Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
your Arg-I
accomplishments Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
risk Arg-I
. O

Luck Arg-B
is Arg-I
something Arg-I
intangible Arg-I
and Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
ever Arg-I
come Arg-I
your Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
it Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
disappointment Arg-I
. O

Instead O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
strive Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
your Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
would Arg-I
take Arg-I
you Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
closer Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
final Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
personal O
experience O
, O
all Arg-B
my Arg-I
accomplishments Arg-I
were Arg-I
backed Arg-I
by Arg-I
my Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
my Arg-I
luck Arg-I
. O

And O
I Arg-B
never Arg-I
did Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
any Arg-I
disappointments Arg-I
of Arg-I
missing Arg-I
my Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
if O
you O
believe O
that O
hard O
work O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success O
, O
it O
would O
make O
you O
a O
visionary O
person O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
those Arg-B
who Arg-I
believe Arg-I
in Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
are Arg-I
clear Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
goals Arg-I
and Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
final Arg-I
destination Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
carefully Arg-I
organize Arg-I
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
achieving Arg-I
their Arg-I
targets Arg-I
and Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
evaluate Arg-I
their Arg-I
progress Arg-I
until Arg-I
they Arg-I
reach Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
believe Arg-I
in Arg-I
luck Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
clueless Arg-I
about Arg-I
where Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
heading Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
friend Arg-I
of Arg-I
mine Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
had Arg-I
severe Arg-I
financial Arg-I
constraints Arg-I
, Arg-I
had Arg-I
the Arg-I
habit Arg-I
of Arg-I
buying Arg-I
lottery Arg-I
tickets Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
day Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
win Arg-I
a Arg-I
lottery Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
was Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
illusion Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
solve Arg-I
his Arg-I
financial Arg-I
issues Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
lottery Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
up Arg-B
to Arg-I
this Arg-I
day Arg-I
his Arg-I
luck Arg-I
has Arg-I
not Arg-I
appeared Arg-I
and Arg-I
problems Arg-I
have Arg-I
got Arg-I
further Arg-I
worsened Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
, Arg-I
luck Arg-I
too Arg-I
might Arg-I
shine Arg-I
on Arg-I
you Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
you Arg-I
some Arg-I
more Arg-I
steps Arg-I
further Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
from Arg-I
your Arg-I
actual Arg-I
target Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
boss Arg-I
worked Arg-I
tirelessly Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
looked Arg-I
at Arg-I
every Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
needed Arg-I
to Arg-I
qualify Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
realized Arg-I
that Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
master Arg-I
's Arg-I
degree Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
credential Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
outperform Arg-I
his Arg-I
competitors Arg-I
. O

Although O
he Arg-B
had Arg-I
many Arg-I
commitments Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
somehow Arg-I
managed Arg-I
to Arg-I
complete Arg-I
this Arg-I
degree Arg-I
before Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
eligible Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
amidst Arg-I
a Arg-I
stiff Arg-I
competition Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
got Arg-I
nominated Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
scholarship Arg-I
since O
he Arg-B
had Arg-I
more Arg-I
credentials Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
officers Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
. O

Although O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
lucky Arg-I
, O
depending Arg-B
on Arg-I
luck Arg-I
for Arg-I
everything Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
good Arg-I
. O

Hence O
I Arg-B
strongly Arg-I
believe Arg-I
in Arg-I
hard Arg-I
working Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
easily Arg-I
disappoint Arg-I
you Arg-I
as Arg-I
luck Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
does Arg-I
. O

Should O
students O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
? O

The O
issue O
at O
hand O
is O
whether O
it O
should O
be O
obligatory O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
classes O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
question O
because O
it O
affects O
a O
great O
amount O
of O
students O
worldwide O
. O

Nonetheless O
there O
are O
various O
different O
policies O
regarding O
this O
topic O
. O

An O
important O
aspect O
might O
be O
whether O
one O
desires O
to O
optimize O
the O
learned O
knowledge O
or O
the O
amount O
of O
valuable O
experiences O
for O
the O
students O
. O

However O
, O
to O
my O
mind O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
free Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
classes Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
improves Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
student Arg-I
life Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
and Arg-I
teaches Arg-I
important Arg-I
life Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
a O
liberal O
policy O
is O
very O
feasible O
. O

Checking O
for O
attendance O
requires O
a O
lot O
of O
bureaucracy O
. O

Especially O
for O
larger O
classes O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
check O
for O
everybody O
to O
attend O
. O

So O
an O
optional O
attendance O
saves O
time O
and O
money O
. O

Secondly O
, O
some Arg-B
students Arg-I
might Arg-I
learn Arg-I
better Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
reading Arg-I
the Arg-I
textbook Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
problem Arg-I
occurs Arg-I
especially Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
lecturer Arg-I
is Arg-I
lethargic Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
letting Arg-I
students Arg-I
choose Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
class Arg-I
you Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
escape Arg-I
bad Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
. O

Thus O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
precious Arg-I
study Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
dive Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
syllabus Arg-I
independently Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
being Arg-B
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
classes Arg-I
improves Arg-I
flexibility Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
student Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
the Arg-I
wild Arg-I
party Arg-I
on Arg-I
Thursday Arg-I
night Arg-I
is Arg-I
too Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
end Arg-I
already Arg-I
at Arg-I
midnight Arg-I
only Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
lecture Arg-I
on Arg-I
Friday Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
a Arg-I
liberal Arg-I
policy Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
postpone Arg-I
the Arg-I
learning Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
afternoon Arg-I
which Arg-I
gives Arg-I
a Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
of Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
and Arg-I
improves Arg-I
time Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
. O

Research Arg-B
has Arg-I
shown Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
with Arg-I
those Arg-I
life Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
better Arg-I
they Arg-I
perform Arg-I
in Arg-I
academic Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
psychology O
knows O
two O
types O
of O
motivation O
. O

There O
is O
intrinsic O
motivation O
which O
comes O
from O
your O
own O
mindset O
. O

And O
there O
is O
extrinsic O
motivation O
which O
comes O
from O
the O
praise O
and O
laud O
of O
other O
people O
. O

Intrinsic Arg-B
motivation Arg-I
is Arg-I
known Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
desirable Arg-I
because Arg-I
it Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
learning Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
intrinsic Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
students Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
strengths Arg-I
and Arg-I
aims Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
giving Arg-I
students Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
about Arg-I
class Arg-I
attendance Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
rather Arg-I
be Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
about Arg-I
why Arg-I
they Arg-I
decided Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
motivate Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
are Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
skills Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
duration Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
optional Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
hold Arg-I
this Arg-I
belief Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
current Arg-I
experience Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
they Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
afterwards Arg-I
. O

Living O
in O
smal O
towns O
Place O
of O
living O
has O
the O
most O
significant O
affect O
on O
our O
lives O
and O
we O
have O
to O
choose O
it O
according O
to O
several O
factors O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
tall O
buildings O
and O
crowded O
areas O
, O
whereas O
others O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
a O
small O
and O
calm O
town O
. O

I Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
and O

I Arg-B
think Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
good Arg-I
weather Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
better Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
first Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
life Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
items Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
that Arg-I
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
weather Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
population Arg-I
that Arg-I
exist Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
with Arg-I
less Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
or Arg-I
sound Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
is Arg-I
less Arg-I
stress Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
foods Arg-I
and Arg-I
materials Arg-I
we Arg-I
need Arg-I
are Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
foods Arg-I
and Arg-I
fruits Arg-I
. O

Regardless O
of O
some O
exceptions O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
that Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
is Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
another Arg-B
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
is Arg-I
living Arg-I
costs Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
cost Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
important Arg-I
concerns Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
society Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
living Arg-I
cost Arg-I
is Arg-I
fewer Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
houses Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
landscapes Arg-I
, O
also O
because Arg-B
of Arg-I
less Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
spaces Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

Transportation Arg-B
cost Arg-I
is Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
less Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
so O
that O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
and O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
less Arg-I
stress Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
better Arg-I
weather Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
, Arg-I
better Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
within Arg-I
a Arg-I
town Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
people Arg-I
know Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
deal Arg-I
together Arg-I
than Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
therefore O
on Arg-B
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
people Arg-I
feel Arg-I
alone Arg-I
and Arg-I
depress Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
small Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

However O
it O
is O
an O
obvious O
fact O
that O
people Arg-B
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
illness Arg-I
and Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

Young O
people O
move O
to O
cities O
These O
days O
, O
there O
are O
increasing O
numbers O
of O
young O
people O
from O
the O
countryside O
moving O
to O
cities O
in O
search O
of O
jobs O
and O
educational O
opportunities O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
it O
has O
some O
drawbacks O
that O
will O
be O
discussed O
in O
this O
essay O
together O
with O
some O
reasons O
about O
this O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
the O
major O
cause O
that O
leads O
to O
urban O
migration O
of O
young O
adults O
is O
that O
cities Arg-B
often Arg-I
offer Arg-I
more Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
paid Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
chances Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
rural Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
many Arg-B
large Arg-I
companies Arg-I
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
often Arg-I
locate Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
hailed Arg-I
as Arg-I
promising Arg-I
lands Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
they Arg-B
move Arg-I
to Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
academic Arg-I
career Arg-I
and Arg-I
find Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
gradate Arg-I
stays Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
after Arg-I
leaving Arg-I
his Arg-I
college Arg-I
and Arg-I
seeks Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
salary Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
returning Arg-I
his Arg-I
village Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
farm Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
could Arg-I
perhaps Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
house Arg-I
or Arg-I
his Arg-I
own Arg-I
car Arg-I
after Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
this O
phenomenon O
sometimes O
poses O
several O
negative O
consequences O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
the Arg-B
burgeoning Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
flocking Arg-I
to Arg-I
cities Arg-I
gives Arg-I
rise Arg-I
to Arg-I
overpopulation Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
cities Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
space Arg-I
for Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
dwellers Arg-I
that Arg-I
might Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
poor Arg-I
housing Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
and Arg-I
sanitation Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
it Arg-B
might Arg-I
put Arg-I
strain Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cities Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
large Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
road Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
causes Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
young Arg-B
people Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
or Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
urban Arg-I
areas Arg-I
since O
these Arg-B
provide Arg-I
them Arg-I
many Arg-I
educational Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
and Arg-I
career Arg-I
potentials Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
however O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
approve Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
trend Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
low Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
affecting Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Basic O
economic O
class O
can O
help O
the O
students O
touch O
the O
surface O
of O
this O
field O

In O
today O
's O
community O
, O
economy O
becomes O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
. O

Getting O
to O
know O
the O
theory O
in O
this O
area O
seems O
really O
important O
for O
our O
students O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
earlier O
we O
jump O
into O
this O
area O
, O
the O
more O
skillful O
we O
will O
be O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
although O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
take Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
it Arg-I
, O
high Arg-B
school Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
on Arg-I
basic Arg-I
economics Arg-I
. O

Let O
me O
explain O
it O
in O
detail O
. O

For O
the O
primary O
concern O
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
students Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
direction Arg-I
in Arg-I
academy Arg-I
. O

Basic Arg-B
economic Arg-I
class Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I

touch Arg-I
the Arg-I

them Arg-I

That Arg-B

On O
the O

economy Arg-B

students Arg-B

get Arg-I

Besides O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
an Arg-I
intimate Arg-I
connection Arg-I
between Arg-I
economy Arg-I

students Arg-B

practical Arg-I

vivid Arg-I

In O
addition O

the Arg-B

That Arg-B

Considering O
all O
those O

I Arg-B

University O
education O
restriction O

Universtiy O
is O
an O
entrance O
to O
life O
. O

It O
equips O
us O
with O
a O
package O
of O
wisdom O
and O
virtue O
to O
succeed O
. O

It O
is O
the O
importance O
of O
university O
that O
raises O
a O
question O
whether O
students O
with O
best O
scholastic O
performance O
deserve O
university O
study O
or O
just O
any O
young O
wishful O
people O
. O

Both O
sides O
are O
to O
be O
discussed O
before O
a O
conclusion O
is O
reached O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
outstanding Arg-B
academic Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
eligible Arg-I
for Arg-I
university Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
intellectual Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
such Arg-B
abstract Arg-I
or Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
informatin Arg-I
, Arg-I
easily Arg-I
absorbed Arg-I
by Arg-I
those Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
may Arg-I
prove Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
matter Arg-I
of Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
lack Arg-I
equivalent Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
deserves Arg-I
what Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
done Arg-I
. O

University Arg-B
is Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
gift Arg-I
presented Arg-I
to Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
gone Arg-I
to Arg-I
great Arg-I
length Arg-I
to Arg-I
attain Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
university Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
about Arg-I
academic Arg-I
studies Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
artistic Arg-I
talent Arg-I
and Arg-I
develop Arg-I
soft Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
up Arg-I
for Arg-I
grabs Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
wish Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
their Arg-I
passion Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
develop Arg-I
comprehensively Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
tendency Arg-I
for Arg-I
social Arg-I
vices Arg-I
to Arg-I
rise Arg-I
if Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
to Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Apart Arg-B
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
disheartened Arg-I
ones Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
devoiding Arg-I
of Arg-I
neccessary Arg-I
preparations Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
recipes Arg-I
for Arg-I
failure Arg-I
when Arg-I
applying Arg-I
for Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
the Arg-I
white Arg-I
- Arg-I
collar Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
university O
restriction O
has O
both O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
yield Arg-I
more Arg-I
negative Arg-I
results Arg-I
than Arg-I
positive Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
why O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

A O
greater O
proportion O
of O
the O
budget O
should O
be O
allotted O
to O
education O
and O
prevention O
issues O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
welfare O
state O
requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O
health O
education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
devote Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
portion Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
budgets Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
means Arg-I
for Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
reason O
why O
education Arg-B
and Arg-I
preventative Arg-I
measures Arg-I
should Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
budget Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
potential Arg-I
improvements Arg-I
in Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing Arg-B
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
and Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
centers Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
managed Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
better Arg-I
treatments Arg-I
for Arg-I
current Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
society Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
educated Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
issues Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
potential Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
allocate Arg-I
more Arg-I
budget Arg-I
on Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
from Arg-I
illness Arg-I
and Arg-I
providing Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
health Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
come Arg-I
with Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
government Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
providing Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
lead Arg-I
its Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
from Arg-I
potential Arg-I
illness Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
cause Arg-I
misery Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
marketing Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
of Arg-I
Ministry Arg-I
of Arg-I
Health Arg-I
in Arg-I
Turkey Arg-I
which Arg-I
aimed Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
problem Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
youth Arg-I
increased Arg-I
the Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
quit Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
and Arg-I
adapted Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
greater Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
allotted Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
issues Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
and Arg-I
greater Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

Work O
in O
team O
or O
independently O
Nowadays O
, O
as O
the O
world O
is O
getting O
smaller O
, O
we O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
cooperate O
. O

Working O
in O
team O
is O
a O
necessary O
skill O
that O
every O
individual O
must O
master O
for O
success O
. O

Despite O
the O
importance O
of O
working O
in O
team O
, O
I O
still O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
capability Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
independly Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
significant Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
effective Arg-B
cooperation Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
things Arg-I
easier Arg-I
and Arg-I
faster Arg-I
, O
but O
in Arg-B
many Arg-I
important Arg-I
cases Arg-I
when Arg-I
team Arg-I
- Arg-I
working Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
alone Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
apperant Arg-I
example Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
tests Arg-I
that Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
allow Arg-I
team Arg-I
- Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

Let Arg-B
's Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
perform Arg-I
really Arg-I
well Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
experience Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
alone Arg-I
, Arg-I
standardized Arg-I
tests Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
SAT Arg-I
, Arg-I
TOEFL Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
your Arg-I
nightmares Arg-I
. O

Testing Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
still Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
tests Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
allow Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
college Arg-I
, Arg-I
acing Arg-I
your Arg-I
school Arg-I
's Arg-I
final Arg-I
tests Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
learning Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
alone Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
increase Arg-I
your Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Working Arg-B
in Arg-I
team Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
your Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

Everybody Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
must Arg-I
have Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
own Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
first Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
them Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
members Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
we Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
team Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
still Arg-I
think Arg-I
individually Arg-I
because O
our Arg-B
brain Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
connected Arg-I
but Arg-I
separate Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
can Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
own Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
, Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
team Arg-I
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
working O
with O
a O
group O
a O
people O
and O
working O
individually O
are O
all O
important O
. O

Both O
skills O
are O
necessary O
for O
a O
successful O
life O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the Arg-B
capablity Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
alone Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
foundation Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
skill Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
team Arg-I
and Arg-I
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
situations Arg-I
. O

Smoking O
should O
not O
be O
promitted O
in O
restaurants O
or O
other O
public O
places O
Smoking O
brings O
a O
person O
great O
enjoyment O
and O
relief O
. O

However O
, O
one O
should O
not O
be O
encouraged O
to O
smoke O
as O
the O
cost O
of O
other O
people O
's O
health O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
I O
advocate O
the O
idea O
that O
smoking Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
prohibited Arg-I
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
other Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
support Arg-I
states Arg-I
laws Arg-I
to Arg-I
ban Arg-I
it Arg-I
because O
smoking Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
damages Arg-I
the Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
's Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
imposes Arg-I
a Arg-I
potential Arg-I
threat Arg-I
on Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
although O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
too Arg-I
strong Arg-I
to Arg-I
assert Arg-I
that Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
prohibited Arg-I
everywhere Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
is Arg-I
considered Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
his Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
ignorance Arg-I
of Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
, O
the Arg-B
second Arg-I
- Arg-I
hand Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
comes Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
's Arg-I
mouth Arg-I
, Arg-I
puts Arg-I
an Arg-I
even Arg-I
greater Arg-I
threat Arg-I
on Arg-I
surrounding Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
person Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
others Arg-I
will Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
unconsciously Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
is Arg-I
under Arg-I
attacked Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
some Arg-B
burned Arg-I
substance Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
cigarette Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
deteriorate Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
respiratory Arg-I
system Arg-I
after Arg-I
he Arg-I
/ Arg-I
she Arg-I
inhales Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
smoking Arg-B
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
strictly Arg-I
banned Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
a Arg-I
polluted Arg-I
place Arg-I
which Arg-I
threatens Arg-I
every Arg-I
customer Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
even O
though O
some O
customers O
do O
not O
worry O
about O
the O
threat O
that O
second O
- O
hand O
smoke O
imposes O
on O
them O
, O
the Arg-B
disgusting Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
will Arg-I
severely Arg-I
affect Arg-I
their Arg-I
appetite Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
words Arg-I
, Arg-I
spoil Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
an Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
smoke Arg-I
exhaled Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
often Arg-I
makes Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
feel Arg-I
uncomfortable Arg-I
or Arg-I
disgusted Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
affecting Arg-I
their Arg-I
mood Arg-I
in Arg-I
having Arg-I
their Arg-I
meals Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
, Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
hand Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
indirectly Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
' Arg-I
popularity Arg-I
because O
fewer Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
consume Arg-I
there Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
smoking Arg-B
does Arg-I
no Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
does Arg-I
it Arg-I
aggravate Arg-I
his Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
him Arg-I
more Arg-I
subject Arg-I
to Arg-I
respiratory Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
it Arg-I
damages Arg-I
his Arg-I
public Arg-I
image Arg-I
and Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
especially Arg-I
true Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
popular Arg-I
political Arg-I
figure Arg-I
or Arg-I
an Arg-I
entertainmening Arg-I
celebrity Arg-I
, O
because O
most Arg-B
people Arg-I
see Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
impolite Arg-I
human Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the Arg-B
public Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
lacks Arg-I
basic Arg-I
civility Arg-I
and Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
public Arg-I
leader Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
smoking Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
and Arg-I
disrespectable Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
spoils Arg-I
the Arg-I
smoker Arg-I
's Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
and Arg-I
threats Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
unwise Arg-I
to Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
other Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
relevant Arg-I
state Arg-I
laws Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
codified Arg-I
to Arg-I
strictly Arg-I
prohibit Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

People O
should O
have O
hobbies O
and O
do O
physical O
activities O

Whether O
or O
not O
people O
should O
have O
hobbies O
and O
do O
physical O
activities O
has O
been O
a O
controversial O
question O
. O

Different O
people O
have O
different O
ideas O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
we O
should O
focus O
on O
our O
jobs O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

Having Arg-B
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
own Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
having Arg-B
hobbies Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
fit Arg-I
. O

Looking Arg-B
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
screen Arg-I
all Arg-I
day Arg-I
long Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
us Arg-I
daze Arg-I
, O
so O
doing Arg-B
some Arg-I
sport Arg-I
and Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
us Arg-I
from Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
too Arg-I
fat Arg-I
or Arg-I
short Arg-I
- Arg-I
sighted Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
neighbor Arg-I
Tom Arg-I
once Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
computer Arg-I
engineer Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
ate Arg-I
fast Arg-I
food Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
and Arg-I
never Arg-I
went Arg-I
out Arg-I
to Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
he Arg-I
found Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
too Arg-I
fat Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
girlfriend Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
made Arg-I
up Arg-I
his Arg-I
mind Arg-I
to Arg-I
loose Arg-I
weight Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
started Arg-I
to Arg-I
jog Arg-I
every Arg-I
morning Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
a Arg-I
moth Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
thinner Arg-I
and Arg-I
finds Arg-I
a Arg-I
girlfriend Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
doing Arg-B
something Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
boring Arg-I
, O
having Arg-B
hobbies Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
can Arg-I
refresh Arg-I
our Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
at Arg-B
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
breaks Arg-I
every Arg-I
class Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
relax Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
and Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Humans Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
robots Arg-I
; Arg-I
we Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
keep Arg-I
working Arg-I
for Arg-I
twenty Arg-I
- Arg-I
four Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

Doing Arg-B
sports Arg-I
or Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
can Arg-I
recharge Arg-I
our Arg-I
batteries Arg-I
. O

Last O
, O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
develop Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
one Arg-I
personal Arg-I
hobby Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
off Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
express Arg-I
our Arg-I
emotion Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
feel Arg-I
depressed Arg-I
or Arg-I
pressured Arg-I
. O

Playing Arg-B
musical Arg-I
instrument Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
play Arg-I
classical Arg-I
guitar Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
meet Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
in Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
take Arg-I
my Arg-I
guitar Arg-I
and Arg-I
play Arg-I
the Arg-I
song Arg-I
Green Arg-I
Sleeves Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
feel Arg-I
better Arg-I
and Arg-I
gives Arg-I
me Arg-I
the Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
. O

Although O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
take Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
times Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
our Arg-I
personal Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
, O
but O
doing Arg-B
so Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
body Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
refreshed Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
release Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
and Arg-I
sadness Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
our Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Government O
should O
regard O
investing O
in O
building O
roads O
as O
the O
most O
important O

The O
population O
explosion O
results O
in O
the O
high O
demands O
of O
transportation O
. O

Many O
countries O
have O
suffered O
from O
pollution O
, O
noisy O
and O
casualty O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
possible Arg-I
solution Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
problems Arg-I
is Arg-I
improving Arg-I
roads Arg-I
and Arg-I
highways Arg-I
because O
of O
three O
crucial O
reasons O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
we Arg-B
all Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
upgrading Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
will Arg-I
surely Arg-I
aggravate Arg-I
the Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
buses Arg-I
, Arg-I
cars Arg-I
and Arg-I
trains Arg-I
regularly Arg-I
emit Arg-I
a Arg-I
noxious Arg-I
gas Arg-I
which Arg-I
causes Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
fatal Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
lung Arg-I
cancer Arg-I
and Arg-I
pneumonia Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
sound Arg-I
emanates Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
engines Arg-I
can Arg-I
worsen Arg-I
our Arg-I
hearing Arg-I
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
happening Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
buses Arg-I
are Arg-I
attributed Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
cause Arg-I
of Arg-I
skyrocketing Arg-I
of Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
. O

Each O
year O
, O
Vietnam Arg-B
has Arg-I
approximately Arg-I
twelve Arg-I
thousand Arg-I
people Arg-I
die Arg-I
of Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
equivalent Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
death Arg-I
toll Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tsunami Arg-I
in Arg-I
Japan Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
investing Arg-B
in Arg-I
roads Arg-I
and Arg-I
highways Arg-I
can Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
the Arg-I
area Arg-I
and Arg-I
allow Arg-I
more Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
buses Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
other Arg-I
personal Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
can Arg-I
move Arg-I
easily Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
always Arg-I
leave Arg-I
school Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
that Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
rushes Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
and Arg-I
hastily Arg-I
goes Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
troublesome Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
escape Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
crowd Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
in Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
hour Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
are Arg-I
enlarged Arg-I
, Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
home Arg-I
in Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
any Arg-I
collisions Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
spending Arg-B
on Arg-I
renovating Arg-I
the Arg-I
highways Arg-I
and Arg-I
roads Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
are Arg-I
afraid Arg-I
of Arg-I
moving Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
rough Arg-I
roads Arg-I
with Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
portholes Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
bad Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
terrible Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
several Arg-I
people Arg-I
feel Arg-I
worried Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
accuse Arg-I
the Arg-I
drivers Arg-I
of Arg-I
causing Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
because O
a Arg-B
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
belongs Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
's Arg-I
more Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
smooth Arg-I
surface Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
movement Arg-I
become Arg-I
safer Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
upgrading Arg-I
the Arg-I
roads Arg-I
which Arg-I
I Arg-I
mentioned Arg-I
above Arg-I
are Arg-I
totally Arg-I
convincing Arg-I
and Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
. O

I O
am O
usually O
inclined O
to O
this O
idea O

and O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
government O
will O
regard O
the O
investment O
in O
building O
roads O
as O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
. O

The O
best O
way O
of O
learning O
life O
Life O
is O
full O
of O
challenges O
, O
difficulties O
and O
unexpected O
obstacles O
. O

Therefore O
, O
learning O
about O
life O
, O
which O
is O
useful O
for O
foreseeing O
problems O
and O
be O
assertive O
enough O
to O
overcome O
them O
are O
needed O
. O

Two O
main O
ways O
of O
learning O
about O
life O
are O
listening O
to O
the O
advice O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
and O
learning O
through O
personal O
experience O
. O

Both O
ways O
are O
good O
to O
follow O
because O
they O
all O
have O
their O
own O
distinct O
advantages O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
the Arg-B
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
life Arg-I
through Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
advice Arg-I
of Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
realistic Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
latter Arg-I
. O

Family Arg-B
members Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
your Arg-I
parents Arg-I
are Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
you Arg-I
proper Arg-I
and Arg-I
sincere Arg-I
guidance Arg-I
on Arg-I
every Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
generation Arg-I
with Arg-I
you Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
understand Arg-I
your Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
and Arg-I
ability Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
tell Arg-I
you Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
you Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
advice Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
many Arg-I
unexpected Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
finding Arg-B
out Arg-I
life Arg-I
through Arg-I
personal Arg-I
experience Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
mature Arg-I
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
many Arg-I
grate Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
missed Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
experience Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
friend Arg-I
told Arg-I
you Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
skydiving Arg-I
because Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
so Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
did Arg-I
as Arg-I
he Arg-I
told Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
could Arg-I
fail Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
how Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
fall Arg-I
freely Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
family Arg-B
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
accidentally Arg-I
harm Arg-I
you Arg-I
by Arg-I
giving Arg-I
you Arg-I
advice Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
will Arg-I
grow Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
dependent Arg-I
and Arg-I
reliant Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
free Arg-B
yourself Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
desire Arg-I
without Arg-I
notice Arg-I
about Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
success Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
. O

According O
to O
myself O
, O
both O
ways O
are O
good O
, O
but O
I O
prefer O
the O
latter O
. O

It O
is O
because O
growth Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
process Arg-I
that Arg-I
experience Arg-I
is Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
experiencing Arg-B
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
by Arg-I
myself Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
learn Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
just Arg-I
obey Arg-I
the Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

Parents O
and O
other O
predecessors O
used O
to O
experience O
their O
own O
life O
by O
themselves O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
the O
younger O
try O
to O
do O
the O
same O
? O

In O
summary O
, O
each O
way O
learning O
life O
has O
its O
own O
benefits O
. O

But O
to O
me O
, O
learning Arg-B
about Arg-I
life Arg-I
through Arg-I
personal Arg-I
experience Arg-I
seems Arg-I
more Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
. O

Modern O
cooking O
methods O
have O
improved O
our O
life O
- O
style O
significantly O
With O
technology O
advances O
, O
food O
has O
become O
easier O
to O
prepare O
in O
modern O
days O
. O

People O
now O
can O
use O
kitchen O
appliances O
such O
as O
microwave O
and O
toaster O
to O
cook O
their O
meals O
easier O
and O
more O
convenient O
than O
before O
. O

Also O
, O
instant O
food O
products O
take O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
be O
made O
into O
delicious O
meals O
. O

These Arg-B
changes Arg-I
make Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
so Arg-I
easy Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
use Arg-I
and Arg-I
time Arg-I
- Arg-I
saving Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
we Arg-I
live Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
extent Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
people Arg-B
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
they Arg-I
like Arg-I
since Arg-I
food Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
time Arg-I
- Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
such Arg-B
a Arg-I
change Arg-I
has Arg-I
liberated Arg-I
many Arg-I
housewives Arg-I
from Arg-I
tedious Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
process Arg-I
and Arg-I
gave Arg-I
them Arg-I
additional Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
something Arg-I
more Arg-I
meaningful Arg-I
like Arg-I
accompanying Arg-I
family Arg-I
or Arg-I
doing Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
more Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
sleep Arg-I
a Arg-I
bit Arg-I
later Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
only Arg-I
need Arg-I
a Arg-I
couple Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
breakfasts Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
second O
point O
, O
since Arg-B
food Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
easier Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
great Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
foods Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
dishes Arg-I
even Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
meal Arg-I
and Arg-I
choose Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
they Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

More Arg-B
men Arg-I
, Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
hand Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
had Arg-I
never Arg-I
done Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
transformation Arg-I
may Arg-I
bring Arg-I
positive Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
to Arg-I
family Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
cases Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
time Arg-I
- Arg-I
saving Arg-I
, Arg-I
simple Arg-I
food Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
process Arg-I
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
select Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
foods Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
willingness Arg-I
to Arg-I
cook Arg-I
meals Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
may O
be O
some O
other O
perspectives O
that O
I O
neglected O
to O
fully O
consider O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
for O
the O
reasons O
that O
I O
have O
presented O
above O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
assert Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
change Arg-I
has Arg-I
improved Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
. O

Are O
parents O
best O
teachers O
? O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
who Arg-I
teach Arg-I
babies Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
walk Arg-I
and Arg-I
speak Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents Arg-B
provide Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
children Arg-B
are Arg-I
taught Arg-I
basic Arg-I
things Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
influence Arg-I
their Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
a Arg-I
baby Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
any Arg-I
thing Arg-I
all Arg-I
around Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
learn Arg-I
everything Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Parents Arg-B
always Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
explain Arg-I
and Arg-I
describe Arg-I
tenderly Arg-I
all Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
simple Arg-I
way Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
baby Arg-I
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
from Arg-I
that Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
parents Arg-B
bring Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
world Arg-I
of Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
and Arg-I
colorful Arg-I
thing Arg-I
into Arg-I
their Arg-I
baby Arg-I
's Arg-I
little Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
parents Arg-B
train Arg-I
their Arg-I
child Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
always Arg-I
make Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
basically Arg-I
say Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
and Arg-I
apology Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
common Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
explain Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
or Arg-I
bad Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children Arg-B
are Arg-I
shown Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
behave Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
easy O
but O
this Arg-B
can Arg-I
influence Arg-I
positively Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
makes Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
better Arg-I
before Arg-I
they Arg-I
face Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
ones Arg-I
who Arg-I
loves Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
most Arg-I
and Arg-I
always Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
they Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
advice Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
experience Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
a Arg-I
professional Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
always Arg-I
support Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
much Arg-I
social Arg-I
skill Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
habit Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
parents Arg-B
' Arg-I
support Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
factor Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
really Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
who Arg-I
give Arg-I
us Arg-I
much Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
love O
, O
they O
always O
try O
their O
best O
to O
make O
good O
condition O
for O
their O
children O
development O
in O
order O
to O
prepare O
children O
's O
future O
life O
. O

Tv O
has O
NO O
negative O
effects O
on O
children O
Nowadays O
, O
we O
have O
undergone O
many O
technology O
innovations O
such O
as O
Tv O
. O

Many O
people O
say O
that O
television O
has O
negative O
effects O
on O
children O
, O
since O
it O
can O
be O
violent O
or O
inappropriate O
for O
children O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
television Arg-B
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
than Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
two O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
idea O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
television Arg-B
has Arg-I
useful Arg-I
and Arg-I
educational Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
up Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
date Arg-I
news Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
programs Arg-I
which Arg-I
has Arg-I
educational Arg-I
purposes Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
those Arg-I
programs Arg-I
wisely Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
many Arg-I
information Arg-I
from Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
Korea Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
's Arg-I
program Arg-I
called Arg-I
EBS Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
targeted Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
teenager Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
through Arg-I
EBS Arg-I
lecture Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
documentary Arg-I
films Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
man Arg-I
in Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
. O

Using Arg-B
those Arg-I
education Arg-I
programs Arg-I
let Arg-I
people Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
inspirations Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
having Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Tv Arg-B
is Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
to Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
our Arg-I
stresses Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
many O
Tv O
programs O
such O
as O
sports O
programs O
. O

Many Arg-B
children Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
stresses Arg-I
recently Arg-I
, O
since O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
about Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
sports Arg-I
programs Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
those Arg-I
stresses Arg-I
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
got Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
stress Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
I Arg-B
was Arg-I
quite Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
, O
however O
. O

After Arg-B
I Arg-I
watch Arg-I
the Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
match Arg-I
between Arg-I
Korea Arg-I
and Arg-I
Japan Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
stress Arg-I
was Arg-I
gone Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
this Arg-B
soccer Arg-I
match Arg-I
helped Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
my Arg-I
academic Arg-I
career Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
school Arg-I
, O
since O
it Arg-B
helped Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
my Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the Arg-B
television Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
violent Arg-I
programs Arg-I
, O
however O
, O
if Arg-B
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
Tv Arg-I
programs Arg-I
wisely Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
than Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
. O

Now O
that O
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
useful Arg-I
and Arg-I
educational Arg-I
programs Arg-I
and Arg-I
quite Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
to Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
stresses Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I Arg-B
strongly Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
statement Arg-I
that Arg-I
television Arg-I
has Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Businesses O
had O
better O
not O
employ O
the O
workers O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
their O
life O
Many O
entrepreneurs O
hypothesize O
that O
it O
is O
safer O
to O
hire O
employees O
for O
their O
entire O
lives O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
productivity O
and O
efficiency O
of O
working O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
those O
assumptions O
are O
not O
only O
conservative O
but O
also O
out O
- O
of O
- O
date O
. O

I O
am O
biased O
towards O
the O
opposite O
side O
that O
businesses Arg-B
had Arg-I
better Arg-I
not Arg-I
employ Arg-I
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
because O
of O
the O
three O
main O
crucial O
reasons O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
various Arg-B
ideas Arg-I
and Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
to Arg-I
flourish Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
invaluable Arg-I
experience Arg-I
of Arg-I
senior Arg-I
employees Arg-I
can Arg-I
pass Arg-I
down Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
apprentices Arg-I
who Arg-I
get Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
new Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
regularly Arg-I
give Arg-I
out Arg-I
creative Arg-I
and Arg-I
novel Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
the Arg-B
rapid Arg-I
development Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
field Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
requires Arg-I
precise Arg-I
updates Arg-I
and Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
new Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
youngsters Arg-I
are Arg-I
capable Arg-I
of Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
those Arg-I
standards Arg-I
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
activeness Arg-I
, Arg-I
inventiveness Arg-I
and Arg-I
enterprise Arg-I
which Arg-I
allow Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
complete Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
vital Arg-I
factors Arg-I
can Arg-I
decide Arg-I
whether Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
can Arg-I
thrive Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
staff Arg-I
soon Arg-I
gets Arg-I
boring Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
stable Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
presume Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
securing Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
and Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Thereafter O
, O
the Arg-B
bulk Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
high Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
and Arg-I
competition Arg-I
can Arg-I
assist Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
horizons Arg-I
also O
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
challenging Arg-I
them Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
don Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
monotonous Arg-I
and Arg-I
passive Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
same Arg-I
- Arg-I
old Arg-I
- Arg-I
same Arg-I
- Arg-I
old Arg-I
environment Arg-I
soon Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
depressed Arg-I
, O
so O
this Arg-B
situation Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
enterprise Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the Arg-B
economic Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
and Arg-I
financial Arg-I
recession Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B
businesses Arg-I
ought Arg-I
to Arg-I
recruit Arg-I
many Arg-I
workers Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
this Arg-I
aching Arg-I
issue Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
enables Arg-I
the Arg-I
jobless Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
earn Arg-I
a Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
factories Arg-I
and Arg-I
companies Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
abundant Arg-I
human Arg-I
sources Arg-I
to Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
manufacture Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
devising Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
unique Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
varied O
characteristics O
of O
various O
people O
, O
feeling O
tired O
of O
having O
the O
same O
occupation O
and O
solving O
the O
unemployed O
problem O
drive O
me O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
the Arg-B
employer Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
hire Arg-I
the Arg-I
staff Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
brilliant Arg-B
bosses Arg-I
are Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
need Arg-I
for Arg-I
giving Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
employees Arg-I
. O

Childhood O
is O
the O
happiest O
time O
of O
a O
person O
's O
life O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
daily Arg-I
struggle Arg-I
that Arg-I
make Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
factors Arg-I
like Arg-I
learning Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
and Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
and Arg-I
say Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
think Arg-I
. O

Starting Arg-B
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
adulthood Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
strictly Arg-I
bounded Arg-I
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
daily Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
are Arg-I
told Arg-I
at Arg-I
what Arg-I
hour Arg-I
we Arg-I
shall Arg-I
wake Arg-I
up Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
we Arg-I
shall Arg-I
dress Arg-I
up Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
we Arg-I
shall Arg-I
behave Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
action Arg-I
we Arg-I
make Arg-I
are Arg-I
watched Arg-I
closely Arg-I
and Arg-I
judged Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

But O
during Arg-B
our Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
, Arg-I
though Arg-I
responsibilies Arg-I
exist Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
what Arg-I
we Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
late Arg-I
for Arg-I
school Arg-I
or Arg-I
laughing Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
where Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
n't Arg-I
supposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
as Arg-I
serious Arg-I
as Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
were Arg-I
an Arg-I
adult Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
great Arg-I
thing Arg-I
about Arg-I
being Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
is Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
learning Arg-I
new Arg-I
and Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
things Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
you Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
single Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
new Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
every Arg-I
single Arg-I
thing Arg-I
around Arg-I
you Arg-I
is Arg-I
there Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
discovered Arg-I
by Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
facts Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
stories Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
and Arg-I
things Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
surprised Arg-I
most Arg-I
. O

Using Arg-B
your Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
and Arg-I
saying Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
think Arg-I
freely Arg-I
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
great Arg-I
thing Arg-I
about Arg-I
being Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
judged Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
things Arg-I
they Arg-I
say Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
adults Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
developing Arg-I
a Arg-I
colorful Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
adulthood Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
boundaries Arg-I
, O
therefore O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
no Arg-I
way Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
or Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
. O

Childhood Arg-B
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
of Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
and Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
are Arg-I
changed Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
adults Arg-I
. O

In O
an O
ideal O
world O
with O
less O
boundaries O
, O
social O
judgement O
and O
more O
freedom O
of O
thought O
, O
things O
could O
be O
different O
; O
but O
since O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
we O
will O
always O
be O
missing O
our O
childhood O
days O
. O

Success O
and O
knowledge O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
" O
Past O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
present O
, O
as O
time O
never O
stops O
, O
the O
next O
generations O
are O
completely O
different O
from O
the O
predecessors O
" O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
life Arg-B
changes Arg-I
rapidly Arg-I
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
, Arg-I
success Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
fields Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
predecessors Arg-I
' Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
when Arg-I
learning Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
too Arg-I
short Arg-I
to Arg-I
risk Arg-I
trying Arg-I
anything Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
all Arg-I
should Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
other Arg-I
's Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
so O
that O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
making Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

Each Arg-B
mistake Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
smallest Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
one Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
treasure Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
full Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
us Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
situations Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
past Arg-B
obviously Arg-I
saves Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
a Arg-I
bunch Arg-I
of Arg-I
failures Arg-I
and Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
people Arg-B
's Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
is Arg-I
as Arg-I
significant Arg-I
as Arg-I
those Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
predecessors Arg-I
' Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
indirect Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
leads Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
goals Arg-I
, O
others Arg-B
' Arg-I
accomplishment Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
served Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
direct Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
looking Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
ways Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
use Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
their Arg-I
targets Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
those Arg-I
mine Arg-I
, Arg-I
put Arg-I
them Arg-I
into Arg-I
practice Arg-I
and Arg-I
, Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
, Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
like Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Edison Arg-B
's Arg-I
statement Arg-I
" Arg-I
Genius Arg-I
is Arg-I
1 Arg-I
percent Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
and Arg-I
99 Arg-I
percent Arg-I
perspiration Arg-I
" Arg-I
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
today Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
probably Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the Arg-B
past Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
basis Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
to Arg-I
develope Arg-I
new Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
it Arg-I
had Arg-I
not Arg-I
been Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
could Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
as Arg-I
modern Arg-I
as Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

How Arg-B
can Arg-I
America Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
leading Arg-I
country Arg-I
if Arg-I
Columbus Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
accidentally Arg-I
discover Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
search Arg-I
for Arg-I
India Arg-I
. O

How Arg-B
can Arg-I
the Arg-I
comtemporary Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
study Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
's Arg-I
gravity Arg-I
without Arg-I
the Arg-I
apple Arg-I
which Arg-I
fall Arg-I
on Arg-I
Newton Arg-I
's Arg-I
head Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
only Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
precious Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
presents Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
ignore Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
past Arg-I
's Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
, Arg-I
success Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
all Arg-I
have Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

We O
should O
make O
full O
use O
of O
the O
past O
, O
instead O
of O
ignoring O
it O
, O
for O
a O
better O
and O
brighter O
future O
. O

Television O
destroys O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
family O
Television O
is O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
innovations O
that O
we O
use O
every O
day O
. O

Besides O
, O
watching O
television O
has O
some O
cons O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
has O
very O
good O
pros O
. O

However O
, O
while O
some O
people O
argue O
that O
TV O
has O
devastated O
communication O
among O
friends O
and O
families O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
has O
done O
the O
opposite O
. O

I O
think O
TV Arg-B
programs Arg-I
are Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
popular Arg-I
topics Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
talk Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
gathering Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
Modern Arg-B
TV Arg-I
has Arg-I
smart Arg-I
system Arg-I
that Arg-I
let Arg-I
you Arg-I
be Arg-I
connected Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
it O
's O
true O
watching Arg-B
TV Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
day Arg-I
, O
nevertheless O
it Arg-B
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
meet Arg-I
and Arg-I
start Arg-I
a Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
about Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
watch Arg-I
at Arg-I
other Arg-I
times Arg-I
like Arg-I
weather Arg-I
forecast Arg-I
and Arg-I
sport Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
people Arg-B
like Arg-I
having Arg-I
meals Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
. O

Families Arg-B
usually Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
television Arg-I
either Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
or Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
my Arg-B
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
sit Arg-I
together Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
watching Arg-I
movies Arg-I
using Arg-I
VHS Arg-I
player Arg-I
at Arg-I
nights Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
was Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
little Arg-I
bit Arg-I
similar Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
cinema Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
TV Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
TV Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
connected Arg-I
to Arg-I
multimedia Arg-I
devices Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
smart Arg-I
operating Arg-I
system Arg-I
like Arg-I
Google Arg-I
TV Arg-I
, Arg-I
WDTV Arg-I
using Arg-I
Skype Arg-I
, Arg-I
tango Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
apps Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
Teenagers Arg-B
can Arg-I
play Arg-I
games Arg-I
online Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
; O
therefore O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
through Arg-I
TV Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
TV Arg-B
may Arg-I
take Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
time Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
your Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
but O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
family Arg-I
get Arg-I
together Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
in Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
. O

As O
well O
as O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
one Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
recent Arg-I
communications Arg-I
, O
based O
on O
that O

I O
think O
TV Arg-B
helps Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
connected Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Parents O
can O
help O
their O
teenage O
children O
prepare O
for O
adult O
life O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
society O
has O
become O
exceedingly O
competitive O
than O
ever O
before O
, O
parents O
have O
the O
responsibilitis O
to O
teach O
their O
children O
to O
survive O
and O
to O
be O
indepedent O
from O
them O
, O
just O
as O
animals O
teach O
their O
offspring O
skills O
of O
finding O
foods O
. O

Parents O
can O
use O
many O
methods O
to O
guide O
them O
to O
achieve O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
asking O
them O
to O
do O
some O
housework O
or O
clean O
the O
rooms O
by O
themselves O
. O

In O
my O
views O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
teenage Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
their Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when Arg-B
children Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
by Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
pocket Arg-I
money Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
oppertunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Take O
me O
as O
an O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
16 Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
found Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
during Arg-I
summer Arg-I
vacation Arg-I
and Arg-I
earned Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
by Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
the Arg-I
beginning Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
semester Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
told Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
text Arg-I
book Arg-I
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I Arg-B
spent Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
salary Arg-I
hanging Arg-I
out Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I Arg-B
finally Arg-I
realized Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
should Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
plan Arg-I
before Arg-I
I Arg-I
spend Arg-I
my Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
did Arg-I
influence Arg-I
me Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
now Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
by Arg-B
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
anything Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
done Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
frequently Arg-I
late Arg-I
for Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
may Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
his Arg-I
payment Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
fire Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
compare Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
school Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Under Arg-B
the Arg-I
circumstances Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
obey Arg-I
the Arg-I
rule Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
to Arg-B
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
should Arg-I
let Arg-I
them Arg-I
experience Arg-I
it Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
. O

Due O
to O
the O
reasons O
given O
above O
, O
to Arg-B
encourage Arg-I
children Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
for Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Children O
should O
grow O
up O
in O
a O
big O
city O
! O

It Arg-B
’s Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
better Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
you O
need O
to O
choose O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
. O

I Arg-B
hold Arg-I
this Arg-I
belief Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
two Arg-I
main Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
, Arg-I
academic Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
thinks O
that O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
grows Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
all Arg-I
day Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
or Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
video Arg-I
- Arg-I
game Arg-I
, O
but O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
true Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
neighborhood Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
about Arg-I
your Arg-I
age Arg-I
as Arg-I
I Arg-I
did Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
, Arg-I
bike Arg-I
, Arg-I
climb Arg-I
trees Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
stuff Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
did Arg-I
play Arg-I
video Arg-I
- Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
that Arg-I
was Arg-I
n't Arg-I
our Arg-I
main Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
things Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
that Arg-I
grew Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
said Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
test Arg-I
to Arg-I
enter Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
another O
downside O
of O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
countryside O
. O

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

Growing Arg-B
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, O
you Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
know Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
gossips Arg-I
everywhere Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
your Arg-I
life Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
really Arg-I
limited Arg-I
. O

If O
someday O
I O
have O
children O
, O
I O
’m O
absolutely O
sure O
that O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
neighborhood Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
happy Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Parents O
are O
the O
best O
teachers O
because O
they O
are O
more O
special O
than O
everybody O
else O
I O
completely O
agree O
that O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
normally Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
are Arg-I
somehow Arg-I
special Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
’s Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
parents Arg-I
say Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
power Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

More Arg-B
power Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
friend Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
adult Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
someone Arg-I
tells Arg-I
a Arg-I
kid Arg-I
that Arg-I
something Arg-I
is Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
n't Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
his Arg-I
father Arg-I
told Arg-I
him Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
right Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
kid Arg-I
will Arg-I
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
father Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
person Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
if Arg-I
his Arg-I
father Arg-I
is Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
a Arg-B
child Arg-I
normally Arg-I
spends Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
than Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, O
so O
their Arg-B
parents Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
him Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
than Arg-I
anybody Arg-I
else Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
contact Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
intimacy Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
children Arg-B
usually Arg-I
mirror Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

That O
’s O
as O
important O
thing O
because O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
intend Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
something Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
observing Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
that Arg-I
beats Arg-I
his Arg-I
wife Arg-I
and Arg-I
treats Arg-I
her Arg-I
bad Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
child Arg-I
probably Arg-I
is Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
rude Arg-I
and Arg-I
treat Arg-I
girls Arg-I
bad Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and O
I O
think O
that O
they O
should O
be O
very O
careful O
with O
what O
they O
say O
and O
do O
in O
front O
of O
their O
child O
, O
because O
it O
can O
define O
who O
he O
is O
going O
to O
be O
. O

Easy O
preparation O
of O
food O
leads O
to O
a O
better O
life O

The O
Technology O
has O
developed O
a O
lot O
. O

With O
that O
development O
, O
food O
can O
be O
prepared O
more O
easily O
and O
it O
can O
taste O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
it O
used O
to O
. O

With O
that O
change O
, O
people O
’s O
lives O
are O
a O
lot O
better O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Some O
good O
reasons O
are O
about O
having O
more O
time O
and O
being O
able O
to O
prepare O
better O
food O
without O
being O
a O
good O
cook O
. O

Firstly O
, O
people Arg-B
normally Arg-I
have Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
have Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
kitchen Arg-I
. O

But O
being Arg-B
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
tasty Arg-I
food Arg-I
just Arg-I
putting Arg-I
it Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
microwave Arg-I
or Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
oven Arg-I
is Arg-I
awesome Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
an Arg-I
engineer Arg-I
needs Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
needs Arg-I
to Arg-I
deliver Arg-I
it Arg-I
tomorrow Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
could Arg-I
save Arg-I
hours Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
a Arg-I
food Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
microwave Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
everything Arg-I
from Arg-I
scratch Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
when Arg-B
someone Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
food Arg-I
alone Arg-I
for Arg-I
some Arg-I
reason Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
ago Arg-I
he Arg-I
/ Arg-I
she Arg-I
would Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
good Arg-I
cook Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
that Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
and Arg-I
tasty Arg-I
food Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
guy Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
a Arg-I
dinner Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
girlfriend Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
could Arg-I
just Arg-I
buy Arg-I
some Arg-I
food Arg-I
that Arg-I
comes Arg-I
with Arg-I
instructions Arg-I
. O

Normally Arg-B
you Arg-I
just Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
put Arg-I
it Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
oven Arg-I
and Arg-I
wait Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
that O
ease Arg-B
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
food Arg-I
has Arg-I
improved Arg-I
people Arg-I
’s Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

And O
that O
happened O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
technology O
. O

But Arg-B
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
careful Arg-I
with Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
eat Arg-I
, O
because O
some Arg-B
industrial Arg-I
foods Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
bad Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
should Arg-I
buy Arg-I
only Arg-I
food Arg-I
from Arg-I
well Arg-I
known Arg-I
brands Arg-I
. O

Should O
University O
education O
be O
free O
for O
everyone O
interested O
? O

A O
famous O
proverb O

“ O
Knowledge O
is O
power O
” O
has O
demonstrated O
the O
value O
of O
education O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
universities Arg-B
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
free Arg-I
of Arg-I
cost Arg-I
education Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
interested Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
because O
now Arg-B
- Arg-I
a Arg-I
- Arg-I
days Arg-I
universities Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
name Arg-I
charge Arg-I
high Arg-I
fees Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
leads Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
affordability Arg-I
. O

I O
have O
observed O
that O
many Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
interested Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
failed Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
admission Arg-I
in Arg-I
good Arg-I
universities Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
work Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
left Arg-I
them Arg-I
with Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
choice Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

University Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
money Arg-I
making Arg-I
business Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
issue Arg-I
of Arg-I
affordability Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
today Arg-I
’s Arg-I
world Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
getting Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
tending Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
for Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
finance Arg-I
education Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
admission Arg-I
. O

Whereas O
, O
the Arg-B
scholars Arg-I
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
apart Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
of Arg-I
previous Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
and Arg-I
burden Arg-I
while Arg-I
getting Arg-I
admission Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
, Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
, Arg-I
clothing Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
manage Arg-I
two Arg-I
things Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
working Arg-I
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
an Arg-I
easy Arg-I
job Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

MPhils Arg-B
and Arg-I
PhDs Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
are Arg-I
probably Arg-I
engage Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
research Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
takes Arg-I
their Arg-I
full Arg-I
concentration Arg-I
and Arg-I
surveys Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
idea Arg-I
of Arg-I
free Arg-I
of Arg-I
charge Arg-I
education Arg-I
inspires Arg-I
those Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
who Arg-I
really Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
put Arg-I
their Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
degree Arg-I
from Arg-I
best Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
universities Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
issues Arg-I
face Arg-I
by Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
; Arg-I
their Arg-I
message Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
spread Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
making Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
motivate Arg-I
those Arg-I
scholars Arg-I
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Their O
notion O
should O
be O
inspirational O
in O
such O
a O
way O
which O
makes O
our O
society O
educative O
and O
increase O
our O
literacy O
rate O
. O

Should O
professors O
doing O
more O
research O
or O
educating O
students O
more O
? O

Although O
professors O
in O
a O
university O
are O
basically O
teachers O
who O
do O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
, O
teaching O
, O
we O
can O
not O
ignore O
one O
more O
influential O
aspect O
that O
they O
are O
always O
busy O
with O
, O
doing O
research O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
a Arg-B
professor Arg-I
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
educating Arg-I
students Arg-I
for O
a O
few O
reasons O
following O
. O

A Arg-B
professor Arg-I
means Arg-I
a Arg-I
researcher Arg-I
or Arg-I
an Arg-I
expert Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
specific Arg-I
science Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
should Arg-I
always Arg-I
keep Arg-I
the Arg-I
passion Arg-I
in Arg-I
her Arg-I
field Arg-I
so O
that O
he Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
could Arg-I
push Arg-I
him Arg-I
/ Arg-I
herself Arg-I
forward Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

And O
then O
he Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
impressive Arg-I
professor Arg-I
during Arg-I
my Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
Mr. Arg-I
Yang Arg-I
who Arg-I
keeps Arg-I
in Arg-I
researching Arg-I
and Arg-I
reading Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
gave Arg-I
us Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
and Arg-I
taught Arg-I
us Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
by Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
gave Arg-I
him Arg-I
a Arg-I
rank Arg-I
of Arg-I
AAA Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
what Arg-I
we Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
from Arg-I
textbooks Arg-I
, Arg-I
webs Arg-I
or Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

But O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
turn Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
professors Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
research Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
a Arg-I
professor Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
get Arg-I
any Arg-I
researching Arg-I
works Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
us Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a Arg-B
professor Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
and Arg-I
creating Arg-I
new Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
may Arg-I
stimulate Arg-I
us Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
creative Arg-I
sugesstions Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
professor Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
all Arg-B
professors Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
are Arg-I
fortune Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
leaders Arg-I
almost Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
fields Arg-I
of Arg-I
science Arg-I
, Arg-I
arts Arg-I
, Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
new Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
come Arg-I
out Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
artcrafts Arg-I
being Arg-I
ruined Arg-I
by Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
information Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
ancestors Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
known Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
professor Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
research Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
careers Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

And O
it O
's O
worth O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
it O
than O
on O
teaching O
. O

Television O
and O
Movies O
influence O
our O
lives O
both O
negatively O
and O
positively O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
television O
or O
movies O
influence O
people O
’s O
behavior O
and O
they O
influence O
us O
in O
both O
bad O
ways O
and O
good O
ways O
. O

But O
I O
think O
in Arg-B
general Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
influence Arg-I
our Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
in Arg-I
bad Arg-I
ways Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
good Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
eat Arg-I
more Arg-I
rubbish Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
spend Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
be Arg-I
someone Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
eating Arg-I
foods Arg-I
or Arg-I
snacks Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
foods Arg-I
they Arg-I

foods Arg-I
like Arg-I
chips Arg-I
or Arg-I
pizzas Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
rocket Arg-I
science Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
foods Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
’s Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
companies Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
this Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
and Arg-I
use Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
on Arg-I
television Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
buy Arg-I
more Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
foods Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
turn Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
consume Arg-I
these Arg-I
rubbish Arg-I
foods Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
fat Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

Television Arg-B
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
couch Arg-I
than Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
communicate Arg-I
less Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
because O
a Arg-B
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
used Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
together Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
also Arg-I
talk Arg-I
less Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
compare Arg-I
to Arg-I
when Arg-I
playing Arg-I
social Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
parlor Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

Television O
and O
movies O
nowadays O
contain O
a O
lot O
of O
advertisements O
. O

These Arg-B
advertisements Arg-I
build Arg-I
ideal Arg-I
images Arg-I
that Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
bad Arg-I
about Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
and Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
like Arg-I
these Arg-I
images Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
see Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
women Arg-I
and Arg-I
men Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
ugly Arg-I
. O

Thus O
they Arg-B
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
products Arg-I
or Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
gym Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
better Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
or Arg-I
body Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
a Arg-I
cool Arg-I
hero Arg-I
characters Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
movie Arg-I
smokes Arg-I
and Arg-I
yet Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
like Arg-I
him Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
idolize Arg-I
him Arg-I
may Arg-I
also Arg-I
begin Arg-I
to Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
although Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
television Arg-B
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
are Arg-I
entertaining Arg-I
but O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
they Arg-I
influence Arg-I
people Arg-I

’s Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
in Arg-I
bad Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
healthy O
, O
be O
yourself O
and O
spend O
time O
with O
your O

then O
you O

Reasons O
why O

Many O

when O
they O
travel O
to O
new O
places O
, O
other O
people O
do O
n't O

I Arg-B
personaly Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
museums Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
'm Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
and Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
reason O
why O
people O
are O
willing O
to O
visit O
museums O
when O
they O
travel O
to O
a O
new O
territory O
is O
that O
museums Arg-B
provide Arg-I
a Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
different Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
place Arg-I
, O
as O
I O
said O
back O
. O

And Arg-B
also Arg-I
taking Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
for Arg-I
making Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Visit Arg-B
museums Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
you Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
establish Arg-I
relations Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
conversations Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
that Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
speaks Arg-I
very Arg-I
highly Arg-I
of Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
other Arg-B
people Arg-I
visit Arg-I
museums Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
boring Arg-I
expirience Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
trip Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
cousin Arg-I
Pedro Arg-I
literaly Arg-I
hates Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
museums Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
really Arg-I
enjoyed Arg-I
his Arg-I
visit Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
famous Arg-I
London Arg-I
- Arg-I
Madame Arg-I
Tussaud Arg-I
museum Arg-I

, Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
that Arg-I
visit Arg-I
helped Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
artist Arg-I
works Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
addition Arg-I
he Arg-I
started Arg-I
to Arg-I
respect Arg-I
and Arg-I
admire Arg-I
other Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
arts Arg-I
that Arg-I
offers Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
museums Arg-I
. O

In O
coclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
museums Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
visual Arg-I
source Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
, Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
any Arg-I
place Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
educational Arg-I
. O

A O
man O
's O
manner O
is O
a O
mirror O
that O
reflects O
his O
virtues O

Once O
a O
celebrity O
said O
: O
A O
man O
's O
manner O
is O
a O
mirror O
that O
reflects O
his O
virtues O
. O

Recently O
, O
the O
social O
environment O
we O
lived O
with O
busy O
noises O
and O
crowded O
spaces O
in O
case O
that O
people O
pay O
less O
attentions O
on O
their O
behaviors O
and O
manners O
. O

They O
are O
being O
rude O
towards O
others O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
phenomenon O
, O
someone O
suggests O
that O
we O
should O
not O
expect O
people O
to O
be O
polite O
to O
other O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
such O
kind O
of O
altitudes O
, O
the O
explanations O
I O
explored O
would O
be O
stated O
as O
following O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a Arg-B
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
manner Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
others Arg-I
a Arg-I
fine Arg-I
personal Arg-I
impression Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
those Arg-I
impressions Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
was Arg-I
easily Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
acquired Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
and Arg-I
blended Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
that Arg-I
surrounded Arg-I
him Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
worked Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
company Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
a Arg-I
guy Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
manners Arg-I
and Arg-I
treating Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
well Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
new Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
will Arg-I
accept Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
then Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
approved Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
employers Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
opposite Arg-I
situation Arg-I
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
being Arg-I
rude Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
get Arg-I
along Arg-I
well Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
I Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
fired Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
other Arg-I
choice Arg-I
but Arg-I
lost Arg-I
my Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
people Arg-B
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
respect Arg-I
from Arg-I
politeness Arg-I
within Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Politeness Arg-B
and Arg-I
tender Arg-I
words Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
speaker Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
that Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
the Arg-I
listeners Arg-I
who Arg-I
were Arg-I
in Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
successful Arg-I
corporation Arg-I
must Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
with Arg-I
respect Arg-I
and Arg-I
pleasure Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
more Arg-I
facts Arg-I
have Arg-I
improved Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
politeness Arg-I
are Arg-I
easily Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
, O
because O
from Arg-B
their Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
made Arg-I
their Arg-I
partners Arg-I
or Arg-I
opponents Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
individual Arg-I
dignity Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
the Arg-B
society Arg-I
needs Arg-I
a Arg-I
civilized Arg-I
environment Arg-I
and Arg-I
orders Arg-I
. O

And O
a Arg-B
degree Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
its Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
living Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
and Arg-I
our Arg-I
offsprings Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
asked Arg-I
with Arg-I
politeness Arg-I
and Arg-I
good Arg-I
manners Arg-I
. O

Benefit Arg-B
from Arg-I
those Arg-I
effective Arg-I
measures Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
of Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
suppose O
that O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
polite Arg-I
to Arg-I
others Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
such Arg-I
busy Arg-I
and Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Your O
job O
has O
more O
effect O
on O
your O
happiness O
than O
your O
living O
environment O
does O
With O
the O
development O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
people O
become O
more O
and O
more O
rich O
. O

They O
start O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
mental O
requirement O
like O
happiness O
. O

While O
I O
accept O
that O
job O
can O
offer O
happiness O
to O
some O
people O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living Arg-B
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
job Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
job Arg-B
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
us Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
values Arg-I
and Arg-I
respected Arg-I
from Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
receive Arg-I
respect Arg-I
from Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
and Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
job Arg-B
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
concern Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
living Arg-I
environment Arg-I
than Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
for Arg-B
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
, Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
tool Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Few Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
feel Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
30 Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Workers Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
FOXCONN Arg-I
factory Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
manufacture Arg-I
of Arg-I
APPLE Arg-I
Company Arg-I
, Arg-I
just Arg-I
repeat Arg-I
one Arg-I
action Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
8 Arg-I
hours Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
labor Arg-I
works Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
workers Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
feel Arg-I
tired Arg-I
and Arg-I
frustrated Arg-I
after Arg-I
long Arg-I
hour Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
beautiful Arg-B
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
basic Arg-I
physiological Arg-I
needs Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
beautiful Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
fell Arg-I
anxiety Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
fast Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
economy Arg-I
is Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
destroying Arg-I
our Arg-I
environment Arg-I
very Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

Factories Arg-B
released Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
wasters Arg-I
into Arg-I
river Arg-I
and Arg-I
soil Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
city Arg-I
and Arg-I
factory Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
destroy Arg-I
huge Arg-I
forests Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
China Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
residents Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
nearby Arg-I
some Arg-I
toxic Arg-I
factories Arg-I
became Arg-I
sick Arg-I
because O
these Arg-B
factories Arg-I
release Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
toxic Arg-I
water Arg-I
and Arg-I
wasters Arg-I
into Arg-I
environment Arg-I
around Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Even O
though O
local Arg-B
residents Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
from Arg-I
an Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
those Arg-I
factories Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
feel Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
from Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
paying Arg-I
job Arg-I
yet O
because O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
cancer Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
far Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
our Arg-I
living Arg-I
environment Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
job Arg-I
or Arg-I
work Arg-I
since O
the Arg-B
goal Arg-I
people Arg-I
is Arg-I
for Arg-I
good Arg-I
livers Arg-I
. O

Television O
has O
more O
bad O
than O
good O
in O
respect O
of O
bonds O
with O
family O
and O
friends O

There O
are O
many O
interesting O
programs O
on O
television O
which O
anyone O
can O
enjoy O
at O
little O
cost O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
hobbies O
such O
as O
going O
to O
theater O
or O
going O
to O
sports O
stadium O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
cost O
- O
effective O
hobby O
that O
gives O
viewer O
quiet O
a O
few O
indirect O
experiences O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
television Arg-B
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
bad Arg-I
than Arg-I
good Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
made Arg-I
people Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
television Arg-B
shows Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
forget Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
programs Arg-I
tends Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
obessed Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
on Arg-I
air Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
make Arg-I
appointment Arg-I
or Arg-I
go Arg-I
out Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
or Arg-I
friends Arg-I
at Arg-I
that Arg-I
time Arg-I
since O
they Arg-B
think Arg-I
the Arg-I
programs Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
once Arg-I
cancelled Arg-I
an Arg-I
appointment Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
with Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
the Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
television Arg-I
show Arg-I
" Arg-I
Infinete Arg-I
Challenges Arg-I
" Arg-I

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
about Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
about Arg-I
our Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
often Arg-I
we Arg-I
meet Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
, O
watching Arg-B
television Arg-I
alone Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
lost Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
cohesion Arg-I
between Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
even Arg-B
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
watch Arg-I
television Arg-I
together Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
chance Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

Watching Arg-B
television Arg-I
program Arg-I
together Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
that Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
watching Arg-I
same Arg-I
program Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
television Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
closeness Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
my O
point O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
reported Arg-I
that Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
converse Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
natural Arg-I
they Arg-I
behave Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
way Arg-I
because O
television Arg-B
shows Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
require Arg-I
any Arg-I
participation Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
to Arg-I
communication Arg-I
among Arg-I
members Arg-I
in Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
family Arg-I
or Arg-I
friends Arg-I
or Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
sit Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
just Arg-I
stare Arg-I
forward Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
because Arg-I
television Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
be Arg-I
obsessed Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
makes Arg-I
their Arg-I
mouth Arg-I
close Arg-I
. O

Haste O
makes O
waste O

This O
saying O
is O
stating O
that O
every Arg-B
fast Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
well Arg-I
thought Arg-I
decision Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
statement O
is O
completely O
true O
, O
for O
these O
few O
reasons O
: O
For O
one O
thing O
, O
making Arg-B
a Arg-I
quick Arg-I
decision Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
not Arg-I
very Arg-I
thought Arg-I
out Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
n't Arg-I
been Arg-I
checked Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
its Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
making Arg-B
quick Arg-I
decisions Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
probable Arg-I
bad Arg-I
results Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
: O
if Arg-B
someone Arg-I
decided Arg-I
to Arg-I
quit Arg-I
his Arg-I
job Arg-I
without Arg-I
really Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
alternative Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
plan Arg-I
B Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
could Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
being Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
speedy Arg-I
decision Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
making Arg-B
a Arg-I
rushed Arg-I
decision Arg-I
could Arg-I
also Arg-I
mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
missing Arg-I
out Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
potential Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
. O

In O
another O
word O
, O
if Arg-B
this Arg-I
person Arg-I
had Arg-I
waited Arg-I
and Arg-I
thought Arg-I
his Arg-I
decision Arg-I
through Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
missed Arg-I
out Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
job Arg-I
opening Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
firm Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
different Arg-I
position Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
he Arg-B
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
that O
hasty Arg-B
decisions Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
goes Arg-I
to Arg-I
waste Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
, Arg-I
could Arg-I
affect Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
put Arg-I
it Arg-I
differently Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
after Arg-I
this Arg-I
person Arg-I
has Arg-I
quit Arg-I
his Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
pay Arg-I
his Arg-I
bills Arg-I
nor Arg-I
buy Arg-I
what Arg-I
he Arg-I
needs Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
needs Arg-I
, O
thus O
, O
his Arg-B
life Arg-I
had Arg-I
taken Arg-I
a Arg-I
turn Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
worst Arg-I
. O

As O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
this O
, O
is O
that O
a Arg-B
hurried Arg-I
decision Arg-I
is Arg-I
almost Arg-I
never Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
why O
one O
should O
always O
study O
his O
decision O
carefully O
and O
slowly O
, O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
decision O
that O
the O
person O
is O
making O
is O
the O
best O
for O
him O
. O

People O
are O
now O
able O
to O
overcome O
long O
distances O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time O

Nowadays O
the O
automobile O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
forms O
of O
transportation O
in O
everyday O
life O
. O

Many O
people O
own O
cars O
and O
use O
them O
daily O
, O
which O
clearly O
shows O
how O
important O
they O
are O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
I O
definitely O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
cars Arg-B
have Arg-I
improved Arg-I
modern Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
overcome Arg-I
long Arg-I
distances Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
in O
relationships O
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
over Arg-I
great Arg-I
distances Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
visit Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
regularly Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
their Arg-I
vehicle Arg-I
. O

From O
my O
personal O
experience O
I O
recall O
that O
my Arg-B
car Arg-I
has Arg-I
always Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
my Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
friends Arg-I
very Arg-I
often Arg-I
although Arg-I
I Arg-I
lived Arg-I
in Arg-I
another Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
was Arg-I
also Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
establish Arg-I
a Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
living Arg-I
89 Arg-I
kilometers Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
car Arg-I
we Arg-I
could Arg-I
see Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
weekends Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
a Arg-I
happy Arg-I
couple Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
my Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
we Arg-I
would Arg-I
probably Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
a Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
cars Arg-B
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
employment Arg-I
because O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
drive Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
further Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
flexible Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
father Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
has Arg-I
always Arg-I
been Arg-I
working Arg-I
all Arg-I
around Arg-I
Germany Arg-I
and Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
earned Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
used Arg-I
his Arg-I
car Arg-I
to Arg-I
drive Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
worked Arg-I
there Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
week Arg-I
and Arg-I
came Arg-I
home Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
weekend Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
no Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
weekends Arg-I
so Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
his Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
- Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
financial Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
in Arg-I
social Arg-I
terms Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
the Arg-B
automobile Arg-I
allows Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
more Arg-I
often Arg-I
and Arg-I
thus Arg-I
get Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
own Arg-I
cars Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
hometown Arg-I
or Arg-I
village Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
using Arg-I
public Arg-I
transport Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
thus Arg-I
limited Arg-I
in Arg-I
accessing Arg-I
certain Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
nearly Arg-I
every Arg-I
country Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
reached Arg-I
by Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
be Arg-I
visited Arg-I
by Arg-I
car Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
own Arg-I
a Arg-I
vehicle Arg-I
have Arg-I
greater Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
places Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
see Arg-I
more Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
above O
stated O
reasons O
clearly O
outweigh O
the O
fact O
that O
cars Arg-B
cause Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
provide Arg-I
flexibility Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
nearly Arg-I
all Arg-I
areas Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Travelling Arg-B
, Arg-I
social Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
employment Arg-I
are Arg-I
highly Arg-I
dependent Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
flexibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
that Arg-I
makes Arg-I
more Arg-I
flexible Arg-I
than Arg-I
an Arg-I
own Arg-I
car Arg-I
. O

Choosing O
the O
job O
that O
is O
similar O
to O
parents O
' O
jobs O
could O
benefit O
to O
one O
's O
career O

When O
choosing O
a O
job O
, O
one O
need O
to O
consider O
it O
thoroughly O
. O

Whether O
to O
choose O
a O
job O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
parents O
' O
job O
or O
not O
, O
different O
people O
may O
hold O
different O
opinions O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
think O
choosing Arg-B
the Arg-I
job Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
similar Arg-I
to Arg-I
parents Arg-I
' Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
could Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
to Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
as Arg-B
parents Arg-I
are Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
environment O
, O
they Arg-B
could Arg-I
thus Arg-I
support Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
domain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
industry Arg-I
- Arg-I
related Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
father Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
software Arg-I
programmer Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
he Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
teaches Arg-I
me Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
in Arg-I
programming Arg-I
and Arg-I
some Arg-I
computer Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Whenever Arg-B
I Arg-I
met Arg-I
a Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
reach Arg-I
him Arg-I
for Arg-I
consulting Arg-I
. O

Because O
he Arg-B
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
, O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
save Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
finding Arg-I
solution Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
truly Arg-I
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
more Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
than Arg-I
my Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
I Arg-I
worked Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
field Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
faced Arg-I
much Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
than Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
now Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
since O
parents Arg-B
have Arg-I
worked Arg-I
in Arg-I
tens Arg-I
of Arg-I
years Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
accumulated Arg-I
a Arg-I
rich Arg-I
network Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
deep Arg-I
insight Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
and Arg-I
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
much Arg-I
support Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
they Arg-B
know Arg-I
which Arg-I
company Arg-I
has Arg-I
better Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
or Arg-I
provides Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
their Arg-B
friends Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
industry Arg-I
can Arg-I
even Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
write Arg-I
recommendation Arg-I
letters Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
certain Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
undoubted Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
recommendation Arg-I
letter Arg-I
is Arg-I
extraordinary Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
others Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
struggling Arg-I
in Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
their Arg-I
resume Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
recommendation Arg-I
letter Arg-I
has Arg-I
already Arg-I
passed Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
stage Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
interviewing Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

Some O
may O
argue O
that O
as O
time O
is O
different O
, O
the Arg-B
condition Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
market Arg-I
is Arg-I
completely Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
choosing Arg-B
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
similar Arg-I
to Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
parents Arg-I
' Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
a Arg-I
correct Arg-I
decision Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
but O
when Arg-B
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
trend Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
predict Arg-I
it Arg-I
correctly Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
condition Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
market Arg-I
changes Arg-I
enormously Arg-I
fast Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
flash Arg-I
, O
so O
that O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
predict Arg-I
any Arg-I
job Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
popular Arg-I
for Arg-I
30 Arg-I
years Arg-I
or Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

In O
considering O
whether O
one O
should O
choose O
a O
job O
similar O
to O
his O
or O
her O
parents O
' O
, O
I O
have O
mentioned O
a O
few O
reasons O
that O
one Arg-B
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
support Arg-I
from Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
parents Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
industry Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
parents Arg-B
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
smooth Arg-I
career Arg-I
path Arg-I
. O

Should O
parents O
limit O
their O
children O
watching O
TV O
to O
make O
them O
do O
well O
in O
school O
? O

In O
19th O
century O
, O
television O
is O
one O
of O
an O
significant O
inventions O
and O
has O
become O
a O
indispensible O
appliance O
in O
every O
house O
. O

For O
its O
accessible O
and O
containing O
fancy O
programs O
, O
television O
attracts O
audiences O
from O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
age O
and O
background O
. O

Children O
, O
who O
are O
addicted O
to O
TV O
, O
causes O
broad O
argument O
about O
whether O
they O
should O
be O
limited O
in O
watching O
television O
in O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
forbidden Arg-I
in Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
excessively Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
children Arg-B
generally Arg-I
have Arg-I
weak Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
control Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
thus Arg-I
they Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

Watching Arg-B
TV Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
without Arg-I
doing Arg-I
homework Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
major Arg-I
headaches Arg-I
that Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
have Arg-I
brought Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

I O
, O
in O
my O
childhood O
, O
was O
just O
a O
typical O
case O
. O

Whenever Arg-B
I Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
home Arg-I
from Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
thing Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
do Arg-I
is Arg-I
turning Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
sit Arg-I
there Arg-I
for Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
could Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
for Arg-I
hours Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
sit Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
desk Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
homework Arg-I
for Arg-I
few Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
could Arg-I
memorize Arg-I
all Arg-I
channels Arg-I
that Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
was Arg-I
playing Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
barely Arg-I
memorize Arg-I
any Arg-I
word Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
textbook Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
, Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
did Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
bad Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
sometimes Arg-B
programs Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
are Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
and Arg-I
sex Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
mature Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
judgment Arg-I
of Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
or Arg-I
bad Arg-I
, O
therefore O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
imitate Arg-I
the Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
curiosity Arg-I
. O

Recently Arg-B
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
children Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
imitate Arg-I
actors Arg-I
' Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
even O
worse O
, O
according Arg-B
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
statistics Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
children Arg-I
have Arg-I
violent Arg-I
tendency Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
reports Arg-I
attribute Arg-I
this Arg-I
to Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
programs Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
in Arg-I
metal Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

How O
can O
anyone O
expect O
children O
could O
do O
well O
at O
school O
if O
they O
have O
those O
abnormal O
behaviors O
? O

Admittedly O
, O
in O
concerning O
the O
social O
relationship O
with O
peers O
, O
some O
may O
support O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
rich Arg-I
contents Arg-I
that Arg-I
could Arg-I
give Arg-I
children Arg-I
some Arg-I
topics Arg-I
in Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
viewpoint O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
overtime Arg-I
and Arg-I
without Arg-I
being Arg-I
taken Arg-I
care Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
watching Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
considering Arg-I
whether Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
children Arg-I
watching Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
constrained Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
hold Arg-I
a Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
positive Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
toward Arg-I
this Arg-I
issue Arg-I
. O

Because O
children Arg-B
are Arg-I
poor Arg-I
at Arg-I
time Arg-I
management Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
mature Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
judgment Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
too Arg-I
serious Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
care Arg-I
when Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

Should O
we O
pay O
professional O
athletes O
( O
entertainers O
) O
a O
high O
salary O
? O

Professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
earn O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
money O
that O
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
people O
spending O
their O
whole O
life O
can O
never O
achieve O
this O
. O

This O
salary O
gap O
between O
those O
famous O
people O
and O
us O
leads O
to O
a O
question O
- O
do O
those O
professional O
athletes O
and O
entertainers O
deserve O
this O
money O
? O

From O
my O
prospect O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
this Arg-I
high Arg-I
payment Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a Arg-B
worker Arg-I
's Arg-I
salary Arg-I
can Arg-I
properly Arg-I
reflect Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
competence Arg-I
and Arg-I
value Arg-I
on Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
those Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
paid Arg-I
high Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
must Arg-I
exceed Arg-I
others Arg-I
and Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
something Arg-I
incredible Arg-I
in Arg-I
certain Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
paid Arg-I
for Arg-I
no Arg-I
reason Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
competent Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
must Arg-I
show Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
great Arg-I
enough Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
convince Arg-I
the Arg-I
employer Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
payment Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
profession Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
why O
the Arg-B
richest Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
usually Arg-I
correspond Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
fields Arg-I
, Arg-I
namely Arg-I
Michael Arg-I
Jordan Arg-I
or Arg-I
Tiger Arg-I
Woods Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
such Arg-B
high Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
and Arg-I
support Arg-I
the Arg-I
athlete Arg-I
's Arg-I
great Arg-I
performances Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
only Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
luxurious Arg-I
side Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
rich Arg-I
athlete Arg-I
and Arg-I
ignore Arg-I
how Arg-I
may Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
they Arg-I
've Arg-I
gone Arg-I
through Arg-I
and Arg-I

how Arg-I
much Arg-I
cost Arg-I
they Arg-I
've Arg-I
thrown Arg-I
into Arg-I
investing Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
shall Arg-I
reap Arg-I
within Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
paid Arg-I
high Arg-I
enough Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
conform Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
performances Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
such Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
performances Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
amazed Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
the Arg-B
gap Arg-I
between Arg-I
the Arg-I
rich Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
and Arg-I
normal Arg-I
people Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
huge Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
as Arg-B
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
has Arg-I
equal Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
dreams Arg-I
and Arg-I
careers Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
fair Arg-I
. O

Fairness Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
about Arg-I
equal Arg-I
payments Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
equal Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
goal Arg-I
or Arg-I
accomplishment Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
high Arg-B
salary Arg-I
for Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
is Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
in Arg-I
accordance Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
guarantee Arg-I
for Arg-I
quality Arg-I
performances Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
encouragement Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
more Arg-I
talented Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
of Arg-I
athletics Arg-I
and Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
, Arg-I
giving Arg-I
us Arg-I
awesome Arg-I
performances Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
. O

People O
who O
ca O
n’t O
accept O
others O
’ O
criticism O
ca O
n’t O
succeed O
in O
group O
working O

In O
everyday O
life O
we O
encounter O
different O
people O
, O
and O
we O
receive O
different O
opinions O
about O
us O
or O
our O
works O
, O
no O
matter O
positive O
or O
negative O
. O

It O
might O
be O
easy O
to O
take O
praises O
but O
hard O
to O
accept O
criticism O
. O

Therefore O
, O
here O
goes O
the O
point O
that O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
accept Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
in Arg-I
group Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
statement O
. O

First O
, O
the Arg-B
core Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
working Arg-I
is Arg-I
" Arg-I
consensus Arg-I
" Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
’s Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
accounts Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
group Arg-I
works Arg-I
, Arg-I
group Arg-I
members Arg-I
gather Arg-I
together Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
brain Arg-I
- Arg-I
storming Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
, Arg-I
think Arg-I
over Arg-I
every Arg-I
possible Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
finally Arg-I
reach Arg-I
an Arg-I
agreement Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
long O
process O
of O
discussion O
, O
there O
must O
be O
different O
opinions O
sparkling O
out O
. O

It Arg-B
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
work Arg-I
if Arg-I
one Arg-I
member Arg-I
solely Arg-I
insists Arg-I
on Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
idea Arg-I
and Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
take Arg-I
other Arg-I
member Arg-I
's Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
work Arg-I
belongs Arg-I
to Arg-I
every Arg-I
member Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
show Arg-I
for Arg-I
specific Arg-I
one Arg-I
member Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
every Arg-I
member Arg-I
's Arg-I
duty Arg-I
to Arg-I
respect Arg-I
other Arg-I
's Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
taking Arg-B
criticism Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
virtue Arg-I
as Arg-I
you Arg-I
take Arg-I
someone Arg-I
's Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
against Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
. O

Criticism Arg-B
definitely Arg-I
hurts Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
points Arg-I
out Arg-I
your Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
and Arg-I
forces Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
confront Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
criticism Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
detect Arg-I
those Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
and Arg-I
fix Arg-I
them Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
even Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
word Arg-I
of Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
will Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
lose Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
improved Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
take Arg-I
any Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
will Arg-I
you Arg-I
fail Arg-I
in Arg-I
cooperating Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
get Arg-I
defeated Arg-I
in Arg-I
personal Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
one Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
idiom Arg-I
goes Arg-I
: Arg-I
" Arg-I
The Arg-I
good Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
tastes Arg-I
bitter Arg-I
“ Arg-I
. O

Criticism Arg-B
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
solution Arg-I
to Arg-I
heal Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
might O
ask O
: O
what O
if O
the O
criticism O
proves O
to O
be O
wrong O
? O

What O
if O
that O
I O
was O
at O
first O
right O
but O
the O
seemingly O
reasonable O
criticism O
led O
me O
to O
the O
wrong O
direction O
? O

Does O
n't O
insistence O
also O
a O
good O
character O
? O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
right Arg-I
, Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
because O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
it Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
fixer Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
also Arg-I
serves Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
practice Arg-I
to Arg-I
test Arg-I
you Arg-I
how Arg-I
much Arg-I
you Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
your Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Taking Arg-B
criticism Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
necessary Arg-I

mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
it Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
judgments Arg-I
too Arg-I
! O

And Arg-B
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
criticism Arg-B
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
group Arg-I
working Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
we Arg-I
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
criticism Arg-I
. O

It O
's O
just O
like O
a O
picky O
mirror O
through O
which O
we O
can O
see O
the O
bad O
side O
of O
us O
and O
thus O
try O
to O
become O
more O
beautiful O
and O
confident O
. O

How O
teachers O
can O
make O
the O
subject O
interesting O
to O
students O
! O

There O
are O
many O
ways O
of O
teaching O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
strictly O
and O
carefully O
presenting O
theories O
in O
the O
class O
is O
the O
best O
way O
of O
teaching O
, O
while O
others O
assert O
that O
involving O
applications O
on O
that O
theory O
will O
be O
more O
convincing O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
second O
idea O
that O
the Arg-B
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
subject Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
explain Arg-I
how Arg-I
that Arg-I
subject Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
and Arg-I
apply Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
outside Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
by Arg-B
explaining Arg-I
how Arg-I
the Arg-I
subject Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
vivid Arg-I
impression Arg-I
on Arg-I
that Arg-I
subject Arg-I
thus Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
and Arg-I
active Arg-I
in Arg-I
acquiring Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
that Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
chemistry Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
merely Arg-I
memorizing Arg-I
the Arg-I
names Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
substances Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
structural Arg-I
formulas Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
boring Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
representing Arg-I
where Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
those Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
reactions Arg-I
really Arg-I
happen Arg-I
near Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
raise Arg-I
their Arg-I
curiosity Arg-I
and Arg-I
lead Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
digest Arg-I
those Arg-I
theories Arg-I
learned Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
senior Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
once Arg-I
showed Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
the Arg-I
detergent Arg-I
dissolves Arg-I
oil Arg-I
by Arg-I
an Arg-I
experiment Arg-I
and Arg-I
later Arg-I
on Arg-I
taught Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
describe Arg-I
this Arg-I
process Arg-I
with Arg-I
formal Arg-I
structural Arg-I
formulas Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
method Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
the Arg-I
results Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
connected Arg-I
the Arg-I
visual Arg-I
images Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
experiment Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
formula Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
barely Arg-I
forget Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
now Arg-I
I Arg-I
'm Arg-I
not Arg-I
studying Arg-I
chemistry Arg-I
anymore Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
by Arg-B
bridging Arg-I
the Arg-I
theories Arg-I
with Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
events Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
and Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
problem Arg-I
- Arg-I
solving Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
address Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
interests Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
the Arg-I
assignment Arg-I
that Arg-I
needs Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
participation Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
law Arg-I
class Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
informed Arg-I
their Arg-I
rights Arg-I
and Arg-I
duties Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
taught Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
apply Arg-I
law Arg-I
to Arg-I
different Arg-I
situations Arg-I
that Arg-I
might Arg-I
happen Arg-I
upon Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
any Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
situations Arg-I
occurs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
think Arg-I
independently Arg-I
and Arg-I
figure Arg-I
out Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
react Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
using Arg-B
life Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
and Arg-I
examples Arg-I
to Arg-I
demonstrate Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
subject Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
effective Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
attract Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
attention Arg-I
and Arg-I
keep Arg-I
them Arg-I
eager Arg-I
on Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, O
not O
only O
because O
it Arg-B
reinforces Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
impression Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
invites Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
practice Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
out Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

Environmental O
protection O
vs O
Economic O
developments O
Environmental O
protection O
and O
economic O
developments O
might O
be O
the O
biggest O
issues O
in O
the O
21st O
century O
. O

They O
are O
both O
important O
because O
they O
are O
vital O
to O
human O
's O
future O
and O
welfare O
. O

However O
, O
since O
the O
budget O
and O
the O
recourse O
are O
limited O
, O
governments O
must O
choose O
between O
these O
two O
issues O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
tackling Arg-B
down Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
priority Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
. O

The O
following O
are O
reasons O
why O
. O

First O
, O
environmental Arg-B
protection Arg-I
is Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
urgent Arg-I
than Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
the Arg-I
living Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
live Arg-I
together Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
mother Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
and Arg-I
she Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
Earth Arg-I
, Arg-I
whatever Arg-I
great Arg-I
civil Arg-I
constructions Arg-I
and Arg-I
economic Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
will Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
vain Arg-I
because O
we Arg-B
will Arg-I
all Arg-I
perish Arg-I
as Arg-I
she Arg-I
's Arg-I
gone Arg-I
. O

Just Arg-B
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
that Arg-I
needs Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
body Arg-I
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
living Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
whole Arg-I
needs Arg-I
a Arg-I
strong Arg-I
planet Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
the Arg-B
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
are Arg-I
boarder Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
profound Arg-I
than Arg-I
economic Arg-I
issues Arg-I
. O

Environmental Arg-B
problems Arg-I
are Arg-I
global Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
local Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
no Arg-I
countries Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
spared Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
global Arg-I
warming Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
temperature Arg-I
increases Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
globe Arg-I
is Arg-I
affected Arg-I
, Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
the Arg-I
hotter Arg-I
weather Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
melting Arg-I
ice Arg-I
mountain Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
jeopardizes Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
polar Arg-I
region Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
its Arg-I
effects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
rising Arg-I
sea Arg-I
level Arg-I
also Arg-I
endangers Arg-I
the Arg-I
residents Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
small Arg-I
island Arg-I
near Arg-I
the Arg-I
equator Arg-I
, O
since O
the Arg-B
rising Arg-I
sea Arg-I
water Arg-I
could Arg-I
drown Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Environmental Arg-B
issues Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
divided Arg-I
by Arg-I
nationality Arg-I
because O
all Arg-B
humans Arg-I
are Arg-I
simply Arg-I
entwined Arg-I
together Arg-I
by Arg-I
our Arg-I
only Arg-I
home Arg-I
- Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
economic Arg-B
issues Arg-I
are Arg-I
global Arg-I
and Arg-I
critical Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
thus Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
aside Arg-I
. O

They O
may O
say O
that O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
is Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
bad Arg-I
situation Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
revolt Arg-I
instantly Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
seem Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
like Arg-I
chronic Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
burst Arg-I
out Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
truth Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
've Arg-I
been Arg-I
encountering Arg-I
so Arg-I
many Arg-I
sighs Arg-I
and Arg-I
warnings Arg-I
of Arg-I
global Arg-I
climate Arg-I
anomalies Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
right Arg-I
now Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
unwise Arg-I
to Arg-I
still Arg-I
deny Arg-I
the Arg-I
truth Arg-I
and Arg-I
keep Arg-I
focusing Arg-I
on Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
and Arg-I
unfortunately Arg-I
, Arg-I
usually Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
are Arg-I
even Arg-I
the Arg-I
causes Arg-I
of Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
damages Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
environmental Arg-B
conservation Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
essential Arg-I
than Arg-I
economic Arg-I
developments Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
urgency Arg-I
and Arg-I
ranges Arg-I
of Arg-I
influence Arg-I
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
the O
second O
paragraph O
, O
how O
can O
a O
man O
live O
happily O
if O
he O
is O
unhealthy O
? O

Similarly O
, O
how O
can O
we O
live O
safely O
and O
joyfully O
when O
our O
home O
is O
devastated O
by O
, O
ironically O
, O
by O
ourselves O
? O

University O
students O
should O
attend O
classes O
or O
not O
? O

In O
university O
education O
, O
students O
are O
given O
much O
independence O
in O
the O
ways O
of O
learning O
. O

Some O
students O
still O
rely O
on O
classes O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
courses O
, O
while O
some O
students O
do O
n't O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
attend O
classes O
because O
they O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
handle O
the O
exams O
. O

These O
different O
ideas O
of O
learning O
methods O
lead O
to O
a O
question O
whether O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
the O
class O
as O
long O
as O
they O
can O
pass O
their O
examinations O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
always Arg-I
attend Arg-I
class Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
what Arg-I
the Arg-I
outcome Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
is Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
in Arg-B
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
attending Arg-I
class Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
than Arg-I
simply Arg-I
studying Arg-I
alone Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
exams Arg-I
. O

Classes Arg-B
are Arg-I
designed Arg-I
diligently Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
professors Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
bear Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Professors Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
equip Arg-I
with Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
, Arg-I
knowing Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
guide Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
toward Arg-I
their Arg-I
academic Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
basic Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Attending Arg-B
class Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
persuasive Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
respect Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
professor Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
professors Arg-I
grade Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
with Arg-I
class Arg-I
attendances Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
class Arg-B
attendances Arg-I
are Arg-I
regarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
critical Arg-I
as Arg-I
examination Arg-I
performances Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
who Arg-I
even Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
high Arg-I
scores Arg-I
on Arg-I
exams Arg-I
could Arg-I
fail Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
n't Arg-I
show Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
if Arg-B
students Arg-I
already Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
contents Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
exams Arg-I
or Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

Why O
wasting O
time O
going O
to O
classes O
? O

Does O
n't O
self O
- O
study O
more O
efficient O
? O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
rather Arg-I
immodest Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
professors Arg-B
can Arg-I
always Arg-I
give Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
students Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
could Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
qualifications Arg-I
as Arg-I
professors Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
students Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
to Arg-I
surpass Arg-I
their Arg-I
professors Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
still Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
with Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
more Arg-I
thoroughly Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
showing Arg-I
respect Arg-I
for Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
through Arg-I
attending Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

Passing O
the O
exams O
is O
not O
the O
terminal O
purpose O
of O
learning O
. O

The O
learning O
process O
itself O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
most O
important O
and O
powerful O
way O
of O
evaluating O
a O
student O
. O

What O
's O
more O
important O
: O
hard O
work O
or O
luck O
? O

What O
do O
you O
think O
when O
you O
see O
a O
beautiful O
building O
? O

And O
also O
when O
you O
see O
an O
airport O
? O

Do O
you O
think O
they O
have O
built O
by O
chance O
? O

Of O
course O
do O
n't O
. O

Also O
it O
is O
ridiculous O
if O
you O
think O
world O
wide O
webs O
such O
as O
Google O
, O
Yahoo O
etc O
. O

created O
by O
chance O
. O

Howbeit O

some O
people O
think O
that O
luck O
is O
cause O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
success O
, O
but O
to O
be O
frank O
I O
can O
not O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

I O
would O
explore O
my O
primary O
reasons O
here O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
famous Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
diligent Arg-I
people Arg-I
not Arg-I
lucky Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Hard Arg-B
work Arg-I
make Arg-I
you Arg-I
a Arg-I
professional Arg-I
man Arg-I
/ Arg-I
woman Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

I O
mean O
, O
when Arg-B
you Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
you Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
portion Arg-I
of Arg-I
chance Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
in Arg-B
football Arg-I
game Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
said Arg-I
that Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
- Arg-I
kick Arg-I
need Arg-I
good Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Statically Arg-B
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
goal Arg-I
is Arg-I
fifty Arg-I
- Arg-I
fifty Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
I Arg-I
think Arg-I
Ronaldo Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
goal Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
- Arg-I
kick Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
than Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
for Arg-I
which Arg-I
Ronaldo Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
fortune Arg-I
than Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

Definitely Arg-B
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
for Arg-I
which Arg-I
he Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
practice Arg-I
and Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
than Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
do Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
in Arg-I
football Arg-I
field Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
, O
so O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
for Arg-I
which Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
luckier Arg-I
than Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
lean Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
luck Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
disavow Arg-I
the Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
luck Arg-I
in Arg-I
success Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
as Arg-I
you Arg-I
know Arg-I
it Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
accompany Arg-I
us Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
you Arg-B
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
TOEFL Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
- Arg-I
choice Arg-I
test Arg-I
which Arg-I
has Arg-I
four Arg-I
option Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
question Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
it Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
Rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
luck Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
lucky Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
pick Arg-I
up Arg-I
any Arg-I
choice Arg-I
by Arg-I
chance Arg-I
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
fail Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

Undoubtedly O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
wise Arg-I
advice Arg-I
which Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
hard Arg-I
study Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
on Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
you Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
before Arg-I
doing Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
in Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
most Arg-I
fortunate Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
word Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
manufacture Arg-I
an Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
or Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
tower Arg-I
just Arg-I
by Arg-I
her Arg-I
or Arg-I
his Arg-I
chance Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
plans Arg-I
is Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
mastered Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Undoubtedly O
such Arg-B
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
hard Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
I O
think O
any Arg-B
great Arg-I
success Arg-I
need Arg-I
great Arg-I
work Arg-I
not Arg-I
great Arg-I
luck Arg-I
, O
even O
though O
luck Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
factor Arg-I
in Arg-I
reaching Arg-I
goal Arg-I
but O
its Arg-B
impact Arg-I
is Arg-I
extraneous Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
must Arg-I
not Arg-I
reckon Arg-I
on Arg-I
luck Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
plans Arg-I
. O

Sometimes O
it O
is O
good O
to O
learn O
with O
a O
teacher O
and O
sometimes O
on O
my O
own O
Different O
people O
prefer O
different O
styles O
of O
learning O
. O

I O
think O
both Arg-B
learning Arg-I
by Arg-I
myself Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
one Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
confused Arg-I
and Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
rate Arg-I
and Arg-I
speed Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

Another O
important O
point O
is O
that O
for Arg-B
practical Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
sometimes Arg-B
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
rather Arg-I
learning Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
good Arg-I
and Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
me Arg-I
learn Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
when Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
by Arg-I
myself Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
confusing Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
and Arg-I
has Arg-I
few Arg-I
sources Arg-I
available Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
get Arg-I
discouraged Arg-I
after Arg-I
spending Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
situation Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
'll Arg-I
look Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
and Arg-I
request Arg-I
for Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
him Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
then Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
will Arg-I
teach Arg-I
me Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
and O
therefore O
I Arg-B
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
better Arg-I
and Arg-I
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
get Arg-I
discouraged Arg-I
and Arg-I
confused Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
practical Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
learn Arg-I
them Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
or Arg-I
an Arg-I
instructor Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
driving Arg-I
a Arg-I
car Arg-I
or Arg-I
some Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
like Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
and Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
and Arg-I
some Arg-I
sports Arg-I
like Arg-I
skiing Arg-I
and Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
'll Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
almost Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
and Arg-I
inefficient Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
those Arg-I
things Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
some Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
may Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
understand Arg-I
them Arg-I
incorrectly Arg-I
! O

For O
example O
, O
from Arg-B
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
started Arg-I
learning Arg-I
playing Arg-I
the Arg-I
guitar Arg-I
without Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
got Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
habits Arg-I
regarding Arg-I
strumming Arg-I
and Arg-I
tempo Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
after Arg-I
finding Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
tutor Arg-I
and Arg-I
identifying Arg-I
and Arg-I
eliminating Arg-I
those Arg-I
incorrect Arg-I
habits Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
properly Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
them Arg-I
without Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
extra Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
and Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
either Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
world Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
great Arg-I
and Arg-I
useful Arg-I
sources Arg-I
available Arg-I
like Arg-I
books Arg-I
, Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
books Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
and Arg-I
TV Arg-I
and Arg-I
satellite Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
them Arg-I
as Arg-I
tutorials Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
English Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
languages Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
online Arg-I
websites Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
sometimes O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
both Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
and Arg-I
each Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

Once O
you O
are O
unique O
enough O
, O
you O
are O
already O
on O
the O
way O
to O
success O

Achieving O
success O
is O
everybody O
's O
goal O
for O
life O
and O
there O
are O
absolutely O
many O
different O
directions O
that O
can O
lead O
people O
to O
success O
. O

Some O
people O
choose O
to O
be O
normal O
to O
wait O
for O
chances O
, O
while O
some O
other O
people O
prefer O
to O
be O
different O
from O
everyone O
else O
. O

Which O
one O
is O
the O
promising O
way O
to O
succeed O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
once Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
unique Arg-I
enough Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
already Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
being Arg-B
positively Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
else Arg-I
usually Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
've Arg-I
achieved Arg-I
something Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
superior Arg-I
than Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
competent Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
like Arg-I
playing Arg-I
a Arg-I
survival Arg-I
game Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
sharpest Arg-I
weapon Arg-I
can Arg-I
survive Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
make Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
enough Arg-I
or Arg-I
you Arg-I
fail Arg-I
to Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
from Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
easily Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
and Arg-I
eliminated Arg-I
by Arg-I
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

Take O
myself O
for O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
always Arg-I
chosen Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
presenter Arg-I
of Arg-I
group Arg-I
report Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
was Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
group Arg-I
who Arg-I
could Arg-I
present Arg-I
the Arg-I
report Arg-I
thoroughly Arg-I
and Arg-I
fluently Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
being Arg-B
unique Arg-I
can Arg-I
create Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
value Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
by Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
once Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
special Arg-I
and Arg-I
unique Arg-I
, Arg-I
pursuing Arg-I
success Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
matter Arg-I
of Arg-I
actively Arg-I
creating Arg-I
the Arg-I
fashion Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
passively Arg-I
waiting Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
recognize Arg-I
and Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
popular Arg-I
and Arg-I
prestigious Arg-I
technology Arg-I
company- Arg-I

Apple- Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
it Arg-I
gains Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
success Arg-I
is Arg-I
because Arg-I
it Arg-I
achieves Arg-I
some Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
qualities Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
caught Arg-I
up Arg-I
by Arg-I
other Arg-I
competitors Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
operating Arg-I
systems Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
run Arg-I
smoother Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
companies Arg-I
and Arg-I
its Arg-I
design Arg-I
always Arg-I
wins Arg-I
the Arg-I
popularity Arg-I
among Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
uniqueness Arg-I
of Arg-I
Apple Arg-I
design Arg-I
that Arg-I
creates Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
value Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
being Arg-B
different Arg-I
and Arg-I
unique Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
shows Arg-I
your Arg-I
competence Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
creates Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
value Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
you Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
lead Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
way Arg-I
towards Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

Younger O
school O
children O
should O
study O
art O
and O
music O
Undoubtedly O
, O
math O
, O
language O
, O
science O
and O
history O
are O
all O
extremely O
important O
subjects O
in O
student O
's O
education O
since O
these O
subjects O
provide O
students O
the O
basic O
understanding O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Therefore O
, O
some O
people O
assert O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
learn O
other O
subjects O
for O
younger O
students O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the Arg-B
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
younger Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
because O
those Arg-B
subjects Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
this Arg-I
planet Arg-I
from Arg-I
another Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
release Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
agree O
that O
the Arg-B
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
art Arg-B
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
would Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
horizon Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
thoughtful Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
well Arg-I
known Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
bound Arg-I
by Arg-I
country Arg-I
border Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
something Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
shared Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
every Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
world Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
symbols Arg-I
of Arg-I
various Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

Under O
this O
circumstance O
, O
learning Arg-B
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
enables Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
the Arg-I
fruits Arg-I
of Arg-I
eminent Arg-I
artists Arg-I
and Arg-I
musicians Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
the Arg-I
fascination Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
music Arg-I
masterpiece Arg-I
in Arg-I
Euopren Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
symphony Arg-I
of Arg-I
destiny Arg-I
- Arg-I
Beethoven Arg-I
's Arg-I
most Arg-I
notable Arg-I
workpiece Arg-I
is Arg-I
played Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
studying Arg-B
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
outlets Arg-I
of Arg-I
stress Arg-I
and Arg-I
superb Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
rhythm Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
currently Arg-I
suffered Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
or Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
these Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
destroy Arg-I
one Arg-I
person Arg-I
if Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
emancipate Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

Art Arg-B
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
are Arg-I
, Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
most Arg-I
accessible Arg-I
tools Arg-I
for Arg-I
modern Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
liberate Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
enjoying Arg-I
one Arg-I
piece Arg-I
of Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
paintings Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
Mona Arg-I
Lisa Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
put Arg-I
all Arg-I
their Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
down Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
ground Arg-I
and Arg-I
just Arg-I
think Arg-I
about Arg-I
what Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
proficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
mysterious Arg-I
smile Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
world Arg-I
stands Arg-I
for Arg-I
. O

At O
this O
moment O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
totally Arg-I
involve Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
ocean Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
nervous Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
relieved Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
this Arg-B
sense Arg-I
towards Arg-I
art Arg-I
is Arg-I
built Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
initial Arg-I
study Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
study Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
is Arg-I
supposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
younger Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
own Arg-I
interest Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
education Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
work Arg-I
if Arg-I
students Arg-I
resist Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
school Arg-I
should Arg-I
replace Arg-I
some Arg-I
basic Arg-I
science Arg-I
class Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
class Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
cultivate Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
interest Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
without Arg-I
adding Arg-I
extra Arg-I
study Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
since Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
lengthen Arg-I
and Arg-I
depth Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
and Arg-I
meanwhile Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
burdened Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
, O
younger Arg-B
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
art Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
education Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
second Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Challenges O
are O
different O
from O
generation O
to O
generation O

While O
debating O
about O

, O
people O
always O
have O
different O
opinions O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O

while O
others O
claim O
that O
generation O
differences O
are O
presented O
in O
every O
way O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
every Arg-B
prospective Arg-I
between Arg-I
generations Arg-I
alters Arg-I
and Arg-I
especially Arg-I
the Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
for Arg-I
this Arg-I

are Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
last Arg-I

First O

under Arg-B

are Arg-I
getting Arg-I
more Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
and Arg-I
challenging Arg-I
. O

The O
successful O
people O
are O
those O
who O
can O
quickly O
respond O
to O
this O
rapid O
- O
changing O
world O
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
focusing Arg-I
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
skill Arg-I
was Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
because O
every Arg-B
industry Arg-I
was Arg-I
rather Arg-I
small Arg-I
in Arg-I
size Arg-I
and Arg-I
simple Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
as Arg-B
those Arg-I
industries Arg-I
expand Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
internationalized Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
required Arg-I
to Arg-I
equip Arg-I
with Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
skills Arg-I
to Arg-I
answer Arg-I
those Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
now Arg-B
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
business Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, O
so O
besides Arg-B
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
own Arg-I
profession Arg-I
, Arg-I
language Arg-I
ability Arg-I
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

For O
another O
example O
, O
financial Arg-B
crimes Arg-I
are Arg-I
rampant Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
21st Arg-I
century Arg-I
, O
thus O
surging Arg-B
up Arg-I
demands Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
excel Arg-I
at Arg-I
both Arg-I
laws Arg-I
and Arg-I
financial Arg-I
management Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
this Arg-B
generation Arg-I
is Arg-I
encountering Arg-I
the Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
recognition Arg-I
issue Arg-I
which Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
previous Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
past Arg-I
generation Arg-I
was Arg-I
given Arg-I
less Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
and Arg-I
was Arg-I
usually Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
paths Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
had Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
young Arg-B
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
generation Arg-I
are Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
creative Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
and Arg-I
rather Arg-I
think Arg-I
individually Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
eager Arg-I
for Arg-I
finding Arg-I
who Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
and Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
really Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
fortunate Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
struggle Arg-I
with Arg-I
these Arg-I
sweet Arg-I
worries Arg-I
and Arg-I
these Arg-I
worries Arg-I
are Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
never Arg-I
easy Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
decisions Arg-I
between Arg-I
so Arg-I
many Arg-I
possibilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
taking Arg-I
the Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
challenges Arg-B
for Arg-I
this Arg-I
generation Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
and Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
generation Arg-I
, Arg-I
whether Arg-I
in Arg-I
career Arg-I
or Arg-I
in Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
identification Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
judge O
which O
generation O
's O
problems O
are O
more O
difficult O
but O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
that Arg-I
until Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
generation Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
whole Arg-I
new Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
waiting Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
broad O
knowledge O
or O
not O
Views O
differ O
considerably O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
having O
broad O
knowledge O
of O
many O
academic O
subjects O
is O
better O
than O
specializing O
in O
one O
specific O
subject O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
having O
a O
broad O
knowledge O
can O
give O
you O
a O
higher O
chance O
to O
success O
, O
while O
others O
think O
that O
professional O
in O
a O
specific O
subject O
is O
the O
key O
to O
enroll O
a O
success O
. O

Both O
of O
the O
opposite O
arguments O
appear O
to O
be O
somewhat O
convincing O
and O
stand O
to O
reason O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
having Arg-B
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
scale Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
key Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

The O
following O
will O
present O
my O
points O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when Arg-B
one Arg-I
knows Arg-I
different Arg-I
region Arg-I
's Arg-I
works Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
worked O
in O
a O
large O
company O
, O
which O
has O
many O
different O
departments O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
Management O
Information O
System O
department O
. O

What O
we O
do O
every O
day O
is O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
that O
our O
clients O
asked O
in O
the O
phone O
. O

While Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
Engineering Arg-I
department Arg-I
's Arg-I
part Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
went Arg-I
there Arg-I
and Arg-I
discussed Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
there Arg-I
, O
since O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
studied Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
courses Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
contact Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
person Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
department Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
made Arg-I
me Arg-I
popular Arg-I
there Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
when Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
translate Arg-I
your Arg-I
major Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
things Arg-I
about Arg-I
different Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

Take O
my O
cousin O
Jeff O
and O
his O
friend O
as O
an O
example O
. O

They O
majored O
in O
financing O
when O
they O
were O
in O
college O
. O

But O
, O
they O
decided O
to O
enroll O
in O
the O
art O
system O
after O
graduated O
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
Jeff Arg-I
's Arg-I
hard Arg-I
working Arg-I
during Arg-I
his Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
learned Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

Things Arg-B
ended Arg-I
up Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
joined Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
team Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
his Arg-I
friend Arg-I
who Arg-I
only Arg-I
knew Arg-I
financing Arg-I
issues Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
but Arg-I
worked Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
bank Arg-I
. O

Although O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
knowing O
different O
fields O
is O
important O
. O

I O
think O
I O
still O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
there O
are O
some O
different O
points O
of O
view O
. O

People O
who O
hold O
different O
opinion O
may O
argue O
that O
if Arg-B
one Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
success Arg-I
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
own Arg-I
major Arg-I
, Arg-I
what Arg-I
else Arg-I
things Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
filed Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
may O
be O
true O
when O
talking O
about O
this O
topic O
. O

However O
, O
what Arg-B
if Arg-I
one Arg-I
finally Arg-I
find Arg-I
out Arg-I
him Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
talent Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
filed Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
it O
wo O
n’t O
be O
a O
problem O
at O
all O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
given O
the O
reasons O
described O
above O
, O
when O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
whether O
having O
the O
knowledge O
in O
different O
fields O
is O
better O
or O
not O
are O
carefully O
compared O
. O

The O
best O
choice O
is O
obviously O
stand O
on O
my O
side O
, O
which O
is O
that O
a Arg-B
broad Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Successful O
people O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O

I O
have O
my O
own O
reasons O
why O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
successful O
people O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O
. O

There O
are O
many O
viewpoints O
regarding O
what O
the O
main O
characteristics O
of O
successful O
people O
are O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
supporting O
this O
statement O
is O
that O
successful Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
important Arg-I
and Arg-I
very Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
points Arg-I
from Arg-I
trying Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

The O
other O
reason O
is O
that O
great Arg-B
success Arg-I
requires Arg-I
taking Arg-I
great Arg-I
risks Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
and Arg-I
useful Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
successful Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
them Arg-I
only Arg-I
by Arg-I
trying Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
act Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
when Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
try Arg-I
something Arg-I
new Arg-I
like Arg-I
salesmanship Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
stores Arg-I
and Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
selling Arg-I
goods Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
commodities Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
face Arg-I
different Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
different Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
and Arg-I
personalities Arg-I
and O
as O
a O
result O
you Arg-B
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
behave Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
situations Arg-I
and Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
be Arg-I
obtained Arg-I
by Arg-I
trying Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
be Arg-I
always Arg-I
found Arg-I
in Arg-I
books Arg-I
. O

I O
do O
believe O
that O
great Arg-B
success Arg-I
requires Arg-I
taking Arg-I
great Arg-I
risks Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
very Arg-I
high Arg-I
profits Arg-I
in Arg-I
investments Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
should Arg-I
use Arg-I
great Arg-I
and Arg-I
very Arg-I
high Arg-I
amounts Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
in Arg-I
very Arg-I
risky Arg-I
financial Arg-I
decisions Arg-I
and Arg-I
dealings Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
you Arg-I
may Arg-I
lose Arg-I
much Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
a Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
exam Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
should Arg-I
risk Arg-I
studying Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
sacrificing Arg-I
your Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
your Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
hobbies Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
more Arg-I
you Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
greater Arg-I
your Arg-I
successes Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
take Arg-I
any Arg-I
risks Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
average Arg-I
successes Arg-I
. O

That O
’s O
why O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
success Arg-B
and Arg-I
trying Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
taking Arg-I
risks Arg-I
go Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
hand Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
success Arg-I
you Arg-I
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

TV O
has O
adverse O
effects O
on O
friends O
and O
family O
Nowdays O
there O
are O
different O
resources O
to O
entertain O
, O
educate O
and O
inform O
people O
. O

One O
of O
this O
resource O
is O
television O
; O
however O
television O
has O
some O
negative O
effects O
among O
some O
people O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
Television Arg-B
has Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
communication Arg-I
among Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
People Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
, Arg-I
others Arg-I
even Arg-I
eat Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
some Arg-I
others Arg-I
make Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
media Arg-I
a Arg-I
priority Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

Instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
seat Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
chair Arg-I
for Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
know Arg-I
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
wakes Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
and Arg-I
before Arg-I
even Arg-I
eat Arg-I
he Arg-I
turns Arg-I
the Arg-I
television Arg-I
on Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
even Arg-I
records Arg-I
the Arg-I
programs Arg-I
he Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
watch Arg-I
during Arg-I
work Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
his Arg-I
wife Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
before Arg-I
they Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
only Arg-I
let Arg-I
her Arg-I
talk Arg-I
during Arg-I
commercials Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
she Arg-B
is Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
habit Arg-I
that Arg-I
she Arg-I
prefers Arg-I
to Arg-I
write Arg-I
him Arg-I
an Arg-I
email Arg-I
. O

Time Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
family Arg-I
is Arg-I
gold Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
way Arg-I
television Arg-I
has Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
communication Arg-I
is Arg-I
when Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
even Arg-I
seat Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
table Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
dinner Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
share Arg-I
everything Arg-I
about Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
concerns Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
when Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
dinner Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
fluid Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
television Arg-I
is Arg-I
again Arg-I
in Arg-I
between Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
family Arg-I
or Arg-I
friends Arg-I
gather Arg-I
together Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
time Arg-I
eating Arg-I
and Arg-I
talking Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
reality Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
cases Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
television Arg-I
a Arg-I
priority Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
remember Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
told Arg-I
me Arg-I
one Arg-I
day Arg-I
that Arg-I
because Arg-I
she Arg-I
was Arg-I
watching Arg-I
a Arg-I
telenovela Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
her Arg-I
house Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
time Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
night Arg-I
. O

Honestly O
, O
I O
was O
in O
shock O
! O

How O
she O
could O
say O
that O
to O
me O
? O
. O

As O
I O
have O
said O
, O
television Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
tool Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
entertain Arg-I
and Arg-I
inform Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
happening Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
agree O
that O
television Arg-B
has Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
communication Arg-I
among Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
family Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
as Arg-I
television Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
priority Arg-I
, Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
watching Arg-I
it Arg-I
and Arg-I
eat Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
television Arg-I
. O

Spending O
equal O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
libraries O
and O
sports O
? O

University O
students O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
groups O
, O
one O
group O
with O
less O
interest O
to O
study O
and O
the O
other O
which O
include O
hard O
working O
students O
. O

Usually O
the O
second O
group O
's O
members O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
time O
to O
do O
exercise O
. O

We O
all O
know O
doing O
exercise O
for O
at O
least O
30 O
minutes O
form O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
healthy O
and O
happy O
life O
. O

But O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
equal Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
academic Arg-I
issues Arg-I
like Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
and Arg-I
laboratories Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
or Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
in O
my O
view O
spending Arg-B
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
equipping Arg-I
the Arg-I
gyms Arg-I
or Arg-I
constructing Arg-I
football Arg-I
/ Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
courts Arg-I
are Arg-I
really Arg-I
not Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
sports Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
roommate Arg-I
, Arg-I
Mary Arg-I
, Arg-I
always Arg-I
wakes Arg-I
up Arg-I
6 Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
and Arg-I
spends Arg-I
1 Arg-I
hour Arg-I
doing Arg-I
sport Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
park Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
near Arg-I
our Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
she Arg-I
gets Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
dorm Arg-I
, Arg-I
she Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
and Arg-I
after Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
shower Arg-I
, Arg-I
she Arg-I
is Arg-I
ready Arg-I
to Arg-I
start Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

As O
you O
see O
, O
she Arg-B
is Arg-I
doing Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
without Arg-I
spending Arg-I
a Arg-I
cent Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
is Arg-I
informing Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
sport Arg-I
by Arg-I
hanging Arg-I
some Arg-I
posters Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
, Arg-I
inviting Arg-I
some Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
to Arg-I
lecture Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
body Arg-I
and Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
students Arg-B
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
major Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
interests Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
needed Arg-I
for Arg-I
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Because O
their Arg-B
major Arg-I
in Arg-I
completely Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
for Arg-B
an Arg-I
engineer Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
medicine Arg-I
student Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
fair Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
equip Arg-I
gyms Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
laboratories Arg-I
, O
because O
it Arg-B
really Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
enthusiastic Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
innovative Arg-I
technology Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
find Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
spending Arg-B
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
looks Arg-I
like Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
or Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
out Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
new Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
university Arg-I
programs Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
last Arg-I
place Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
choose Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
and Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
places Arg-I
where Arg-I
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
disturbed Arg-I
by Arg-I
any Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
deny Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
success Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
think O
both Arg-B
sports Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
receive Arg-I
equal Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
with Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
and Arg-I
laboratories Arg-I

that Arg-I

relating Arg-I

also Arg-I
a Arg-I
importent Arg-I

If Arg-B

prerequisit Arg-I

the Arg-I

Consequently O

make Arg-B

On O
the O

side O

if Arg-B

to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I

their Arg-I
boss Arg-I

only Arg-B
if Arg-I
the Arg-I

considered Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
boss Arg-I

eyes Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
enhance Arg-I
position Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
someone O
may O
maintain O
that O
good Arg-B
specify Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
for Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Studying Arg-B
harder Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
resume Arg-I
and Arg-I
absorbing Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I

which Arg-I

make Arg-I
these Arg-I

more Arg-I
competitive Arg-I

other Arg-I
applicants Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
certain Arg-I
job Arg-I

But O
imagine O
it O
, O
a O
person O
who O
is O
good O
at O
working O
knowledge O
but O
has O
an O
poorly O
relate O

a O

his O
working O

is O
less O
better O
than O
the O
former O
, O
which O
person O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
? O

I O
think O
majority Arg-B
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
choose Arg-I
the Arg-I
former Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
latter Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
good Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
really Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
my Arg-I
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
relating Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
more Arg-I
friends Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
studying Arg-I
hard Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
essential O
to O
have O
ability O
to O
plan O
and O
organize O
With O
the O
fast O
rolling O
wheels O
of O
modern O
society O
, O
life O
becomes O
more O
complex O
and O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
handle O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
young Arg-I
ones Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
possess Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
since O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
and Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
actions Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
eliminating O
meaningless O
actions O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
great Arg-B
planning Arg-I
and Arg-I
organizing Arg-I
ability Arg-I
is Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
cause Arg-I
our Arg-I
actions Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
productive Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
myself Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
overwhelmed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
burden Arg-I
of Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
exam Arg-I
, Arg-I
submitting Arg-I
my Arg-I
paper Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
finishing Arg-I
my Arg-I
internship Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
term Arg-I
. O

Yet Arg-B
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
year Arg-I
, Arg-I
following Arg-I
the Arg-I
suggestion Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
, Arg-I
John Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
do Arg-I
list Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
everything Arg-I
I Arg-I
should Arg-I
get Arg-I
done Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
and Arg-I
hence Arg-I
take Arg-I
every Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
and Arg-I
trivials Arg-I
into Arg-I
control Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
plan Arg-I
ability Arg-I
helps Arg-I
me Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
me Arg-I
climb Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
top Arg-I
rank Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
while Arg-I
finishing Arg-I
everything Arg-I
else Arg-I
. O

Equally O
important O
, O
the Arg-B
capacity Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
also Arg-I
help Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
eliminate Arg-I
the Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
actions Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
ruin Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
whole Arg-I
effort Arg-I
over Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
, O
the Arg-B
employees Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
company Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
profit Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
supervisors Arg-I
and Arg-I
complete Arg-I
their Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
some Arg-I
employees Arg-I
lack Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
procrastination Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
take Arg-I
into Arg-I
action Arg-I
until Arg-I
the Arg-I
deadline Arg-I
is Arg-I
imminent Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
things O
have O
been O
changing O
all O
the O
time O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the Arg-B
deadline Arg-I
of Arg-I
task Arg-I
is Arg-I
shifted Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
earlier Arg-I
date Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
change Arg-I
of Arg-I
company Arg-I
's Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
those Arg-B
employees Arg-I
who Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
finish Arg-I
their Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
perhaps Arg-I
are Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
these Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
penalized Arg-I
or Arg-I
get Arg-I
fired Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
employee Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
this Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
loss Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
some O
assert O
that O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
learned Arg-I
until Arg-I
obtaining Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
possess Arg-I
this Arg-I
ability Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
this Arg-B
ability Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
since O
young Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
overcome Arg-I
their Arg-I
bad Arg-I
habits Arg-I
and Arg-I
fulfill Arg-I
their Arg-I
goals Arg-I
more Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
ability Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
searching Arg-I
information Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
probably Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
by Arg-I
other Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
online Arg-I
games Arg-I
or Arg-I
social Arg-I
webs Arg-I
. O

At O
this O
circumstances O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
surf Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
for Arg-I
hours Arg-I
and Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
no Arg-I
where Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

But O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
make Arg-I
their Arg-I
plan Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
stick Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
plans Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
get Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
done Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
beyond Arg-I
their Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
complex Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
, Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
encompassed Arg-I
with Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
, O
so O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
and Arg-I
organize Arg-I
is Arg-I
undoubtedly Arg-I
a Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
and Arg-I
sharp Arg-I
weapon Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
armed Arg-I
with Arg-I
. O

Students O
should O
attend O
to O
classes O
or O
it O
should O
be O
optional O
? O

Nowadays O
, O
it O
is O
often O
claimed O
that O

classes O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
benefits O
for O
students O
and O
provide O
them O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
learning O
opportunities O
( O
options O
) O
as O
well O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
to O
this O
popular O
belief O
, O
there O
are O
still O
those O
who O
subscribe O
to O
this O
view O
that O
having O
a O
choice O
for O
attending O
classes O
enable O
students O
to O
study O
at O
home O
and O
through O
this O
way O
they O
do O
not O
waste O
their O
time O
for O
commuting O
and O
also O
they O
can O
save O
their O
money O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
being Arg-B
present Arg-I
at Arg-I
classes Arg-I
seems Arg-I
a Arg-I
wiser Arg-I
option Arg-I
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
I O
truly O
believe O
that O
being Arg-B
present Arg-I
at Arg-I
classes Arg-I
provide Arg-I
students Arg-I
with Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
of Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
students Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
new Arg-I
material Arg-I
by Arg-I
reviewing Arg-I
them Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
the Arg-I
free Arg-I
times Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
materials Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
attend Arg-I
classes Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
others Arg-I
for Arg-I
assisting Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Another O
significant O
fact O
which O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
is O
that O
by Arg-B
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
since O
teachers Arg-B
explain Arg-I
them Arg-I
thoroughly Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
and Arg-I
after Arg-I
that Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
examples Arg-I
to Arg-I
clarify Arg-I
the Arg-I
points Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
way Arg-I
attending Arg-I
classes Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
wastes Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
facilitates Arg-I
their Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
process Arg-I
that Arg-I
takes Arg-I
them Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
comprehending Arg-I
materials Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Finally O
yet O
importantly O
, O
appearing Arg-B
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
makes Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
conscientious Arg-I
since O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
obey Arg-I
class Arg-I
’s Arg-I
disciplines Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
practice Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
perseverance Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
their Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
ones Arg-I
who Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
any Arg-I
discipline Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
force Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
particular Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

Through O
this O
way O
, O
they Arg-B
may Arg-I
miss Arg-I
some Arg-I
important Arg-I
parts Arg-I
in Arg-I
virtue Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
chaotic Arg-I
and Arg-I
incoherent Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
points O
mentioned O
above O
, O
I O
convinced O
that O
communicating Arg-B
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
with Arg-I
peer Arg-I
group Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
materials Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
teachers Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
conspicuous Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
assisting Arg-I
students Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
materials Arg-I
that Arg-I
being Arg-I
present Arg-I
at Arg-I
classes Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
requisite Arg-I
for Arg-I
benefiting Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
attending Arg-B
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
makes Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
attentive Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
lead Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

Telephones O
and O
emails O
have O
made O
personal O
communication O
less O
required O
There O
are O
many O
advantage O
of O
these O
invention O
, O
telephones O
and O
email O
. O

Communication Arg-B
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
telephones Arg-I
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
made Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
personally Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
notion Arg-I
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
telephones Arg-I
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
, Arg-I
made Arg-I
people Arg-I
less Arg-I
personal Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
give O
several O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
telephones Arg-B
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
far Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
connect Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
email Arg-I
, Arg-I
send Arg-I
message Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
mail Arg-I
service Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
lost Arg-I
and Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
sent Arg-I
to Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
address Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
using Arg-I
telephones Arg-I
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
or Arg-I
write Arg-I
directly Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
connect Arg-I
with Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
right O
now O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
U.S. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
phone Arg-I
call Arg-I
or Arg-I
write Arg-I
email Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

Telephones Arg-B
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
made Arg-I
me Arg-I
feel Arg-I
close Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
using Arg-B
telephones Arg-I
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
could Arg-I
express Arg-I
some Arg-I
important Arg-I
words Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

For O
instant O
, O
sometime Arg-B
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
argue Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
express Arg-I
my Arg-I
self Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
at Arg-I
that Arg-I
moment Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
realize Arg-I
what Arg-I
had Arg-I
happened Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
explain Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
thought Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
without Arg-I
emotion Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
these Arg-B
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
communications Arg-I
make Arg-I
me Arg-I
feel Arg-I
personal Arg-I
. O

Telephones Arg-B
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
make Arg-I
me Arg-I
feel Arg-I
personal Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
directly Arg-I
connect Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
love Arg-I
. O

Beside O
, O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
express Arg-I
my Arg-I
personal Arg-I
thought Arg-I
through Arg-I
telephones Arg-I
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
telephones Arg-B
and Arg-I
email Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
make Arg-I
communication Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
less Arg-I
personal Arg-I
. O

Big O
city O
vs O
small O
town O

I Arg-B
highly Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
to Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
have Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
. O

Where Arg-B
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
lives Arg-I
and Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
because O
the Arg-B
environment Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
, Arg-I
build Arg-I
the Arg-I
personality Arg-I
and Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
like Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
, Arg-I
museums Arg-I
, Arg-I
bars Arg-I
, Arg-I
sporting Arg-I
clubs Arg-I
, Arg-I
cinemas Arg-I
, Arg-I
theatre Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
options Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
spend Arg-I
their Arg-I
times Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
in Arg-I
social Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
contrary Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
few Arg-I
choices Arg-I
and Arg-I
at Arg-I
most Arg-I
cases Arg-I
one Arg-I
bar Arg-I
or Arg-I
one Arg-I
cinema Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
educational Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
is Arg-I
quite Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
and Arg-I
profession Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

It O
’s O
undisputed O
that O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
modern Arg-I
world Arg-I
education Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
human Arg-I
kind Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Better Arg-B
education Arg-I
results Arg-I
better Arg-I
career Arg-I
and Arg-I
been Arg-I
well Arg-I
paid Arg-I
. O

So O
persons Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
better Arg-I
job Arg-I
than Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
. O

Also O
lots Arg-B
of Arg-I
companies Arg-I
placed Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
job Arg-I
positions Arg-I
in Arg-I
there Arg-I
than Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
. O

But O
by Arg-B
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
one Arg-I
sacrifices Arg-I
quiet Arg-I
and Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
breathing Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
air Arg-I
and Arg-I
loses Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
and Arg-I
anyway Arg-I
for Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, O
because O
distances Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
often Arg-I
are Arg-I
too Arg-I
far Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
it Arg-I
’s Arg-I
good Arg-I
and Arg-I
bad Arg-I
effects Arg-I

but Arg-I
I Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
having Arg-I
the Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
to Arg-I
living Arg-I
like Arg-I
16 Arg-I
century Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
what O
mentioned O
, O
medical Arg-B
technologies Arg-I
is Arg-I
completely Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
and Arg-I

in Arg-I
my Arg-I
view Arg-I
this Arg-I
profit Arg-I
overcomes Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
bad Arg-I
influences Arg-I
of Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
kind Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
in O
my O
view O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
is Arg-I
quite Arg-I
funnier Arg-I
and Arg-I
better Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
exciting Arg-I
than Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
more Arg-I
social Arg-I
places Arg-I
, Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
, Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
medical Arg-I
services Arg-I
. O

Which O
do O
you O
prefer O
: O
do O
only O
what O
you O
already O
do O
well O
, O
or O
not O
. O

You O
may O
love O
to O
try O
new O
things O
and O
take O
risks O
even O
if O
you O
are O
n't O
good O
at O
the O
things O
. O

That O
may O
help O
you O
expand O
experiences O
, O
look O
for O
your O
personalities O
and O
find O
your O
new O
talents O
. O

This O
ideal O
, O
however O
, O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
be O
accomplished O
. O

If O
not O
, O
you O
might O
lose O
another O
chance O
that O
you O
could O
use O
to O
accomplish O
other O
things O
. O

So O
, O
I O
definitely O
believe O
that O
you Arg-B
should Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
. O

Focusing Arg-B
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
helps Arg-I
you Arg-I
attain Arg-I
your Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Without O
doubt O
, O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
you Arg-I
spend Arg-I
on Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
well Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
something Arg-I
great Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Albert Arg-B
Einstein Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
competent Arg-I
physicians Arg-I
in Arg-I
history Arg-I
, Arg-I
devoted Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
theory Arg-I
in Arg-I
physics Arg-I
and Arg-I
finally Arg-I
established Arg-I
special Arg-I
and Arg-I
general Arg-I
relativity Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
he Arg-B
hardly Arg-I
cared Arg-I
about Arg-I
something Arg-I
else Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
said Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
surprisingly Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
never Arg-I
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
a Arg-I
hand Arg-I
soup Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
facial Arg-I
soup Arg-I
because O
, O
at O
least O
for O
him O
, O
using Arg-B
two Arg-I
different Arg-I
soups Arg-I
properly Arg-I
was Arg-I
quite Arg-I
annoying Arg-I
. O

As O
the O
example O
above O
indicates O
, O
you Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
accomplish Arg-I
your Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
by Arg-I
concentrating Arg-I
on Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
keep Arg-I
doing Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
already Arg-I
do Arg-I
well Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
're Arg-I
doing Arg-I
something Arg-I
well Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Then O
, O
you Arg-B
will Arg-I
motivate Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

To O
give O
an O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
math Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
junior Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Because O
I Arg-B
was Arg-I
really Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
do Arg-I
preferably Arg-I
, O
I Arg-B
became Arg-I
to Arg-I
absorb Arg-I
myself Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
more Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
math Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
get Arg-I
higher Arg-I
scores Arg-I
in Arg-I
math Arg-I
test Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
- Arg-I
level Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
by Arg-B
doing Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
at Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

In O
summary O
, O
doing Arg-B
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
already Arg-I
do Arg-I
well Arg-I
helps Arg-I
you Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
accomplishment Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

the O
best O
way O
to O
learn O
responsibility O
? O

many O
people O
argue O
about O
learning O
their O
children O
the O
financial O
responsibility O
in O
young O
ages O
or O
in O
adulthood O
. O

I O
am O
a O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
believes O
to O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
money Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
young Arg-I
age Arg-I
, O
due O
to O
reasons O
that O
I O
stated O
below O
. O

The O
first O
important O
point O
that O
I O
want O
to O
make O
is O
that O
sociologists Arg-B
found Arg-I
that Arg-I
our Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
and Arg-I
personality Arg-I
forms Arg-I
early Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
borne Arg-I
. O

So O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
financially Arg-I
issues Arg-I
. O

To O
clarify O
my O
point O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
memory O
from O
my O
childhood O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
at Arg-I
age Arg-I
7 Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
gave Arg-I
me Arg-I
monthly Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
liked Arg-I
. O

First Arg-B
time Arg-I
I Arg-I
spend Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
eat Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
my Arg-I
money Arg-I
finished Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
asked Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
for Arg-I
extra Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
refuse Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
it Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
found Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
should Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

From O
then O
I Arg-B
learned Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
economical Arg-I

and Arg-I
now Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
every Arg-I
thing Arg-I
I Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
. O

Another O
aspect O
of O
learning O
children O
to O
manage O
their O
money O
is O
on O
the O
finance O
of O
the O
family O
. O

If Arg-B
parents Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
all Arg-I
they Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
run Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
essential Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
in Arg-I
rich Arg-I
families Arg-I
if Arg-I
children Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
unappreciative Arg-I
and Arg-I
dependent Arg-I
persons Arg-I
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
just Arg-I
used Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
prosperity Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
I Arg-B
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
to Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
rich Arg-I
and Arg-I
prosperous Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
parent Arg-I
gave Arg-I
him Arg-I
everything Arg-I
he Arg-I
demanded Arg-I
from Arg-I
his Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
became Arg-I
an Arg-I
arrogant Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
stand Arg-I
on Arg-I
his Arg-I
feet Arg-I
and Arg-I
always Arg-I
asked Arg-I
for Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

His Arg-B
parent Arg-I
tried Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
and Arg-I
hired Arg-I
some Arg-I
experts Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
him Arg-I
manage Arg-I
his Arg-I
financial Arg-I
and Arg-I
carrier Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
unfortunately Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
useless Arg-I
. O

Finally Arg-B
one Arg-I
night Arg-I
, Arg-I
having Arg-I
fun Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
irresponsible Arg-I
friend Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
luxuries Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
crashed Arg-I
a Arg-I
truck Arg-I
and Arg-I
died Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
did Arg-I
he Arg-I
cause Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
damage Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
property Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
bring Arg-I
sorry Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

Although O
some O
people O
argue O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
they Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
, O
In O
my O
opinion O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
beginning Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
financially Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
persons Arg-I
, O
because O
our Arg-B
personality Arg-I
form Arg-I
in Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
it Arg-I
in Arg-I
adulthood Arg-I
. O

Dancing O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
culture O
. O

In O
every O
country O
, O
people O
do O
dance O
for O
fun O
, O
for O
entertrain O
, O
and O
for O
decrease O
a O
stress O
. O

Dancing O
is O
also O
one O
of O
important O
parts O
of O
culture O
that O
represent O
to O
something O
that O
people O
believe O
. O

Many O
cultures O
do O
dance O
to O
show O
a O
great O
prosperous O
of O
its O
culture O
. O

And O
also O
dancing O
to O
entertain O
people O
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

First O
, O
dancing Arg-B
are Arg-I
significant Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
that Arg-I
could Arg-I
show Arg-I
to Arg-I
something Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
believe Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
some Arg-B
culture Arg-I
people Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
dance Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
sacrifice Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
god Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
happy Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Or Arg-B
some Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
arid Arg-I
area Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
danced Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
rain Arg-I
would Arg-I
come Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
dancing Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
belief Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
dancing Arg-B
can Arg-I
represent Arg-I
to Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
seen Arg-I
many Arg-I
western Arg-I
movies Arg-I
that Arg-I
when Arg-I
a Arg-I
kingdom Arg-I
have Arg-I
visitor Arg-I
from Arg-I
another Arg-I
kingdom Arg-I
, Arg-I
king Arg-I
or Arg-I
queen Arg-I
would Arg-I
dance Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
a Arg-I
splendid Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
kingdom Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
movement Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
costume Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
music Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
dance Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
many Arg-B
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
entertain Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

And O
dancing Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Both Arg-B
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
see Arg-I
and Arg-I
dance Arg-I
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
many Arg-B
event Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
christmas Arg-I
, Arg-I
last Arg-I
christmas Arg-I
I Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
mall Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
gifts Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
entertained Arg-I
by Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
santa Arg-I
custom Arg-I
dancing Arg-I
in Arg-I
christmas Arg-I
song Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
felt Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
me Arg-I
happy Arg-I
and Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
santas Arg-I
also Arg-I
happy Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
people Arg-I
happy Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
notion O
that O
dancing Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
because O
dancing Arg-B
are Arg-I
represent Arg-I
to Arg-I
believe Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
dancing Arg-B
could Arg-I
show Arg-I
how Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
culture Arg-I
is Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
people Arg-B
use Arg-I
dancing Arg-I
to Arg-I
entertain Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

So O
dancing Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

The O
internet O
provides O
a O
lot O
of O
valuable O
information O

In O
the O
modern O
society O
, O
internet O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
inventions O
over O
the O
past O
century O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
several O
problems O
occur O
from O
an O
information O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

However O
, O
some O
say O
that O
the Arg-B
internet Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
latter O
because O
the Arg-B
internet Arg-I
gives Arg-I
daily Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
explore Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
everybody Arg-B
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
going Arg-I
on Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
an Arg-I
information Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
which Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
businessman Arg-I
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
a Arg-I
television Arg-I
or Arg-I
read Arg-I
a Arg-I
newspaper Arg-I
can Arg-I
receive Arg-I
news Arg-I
and Arg-I
check Arg-I
stock Arg-I
markets Arg-I
easily Arg-I
via Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
useful Arg-I
technology Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
take Arg-I
online Arg-I
courses Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
or Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
watch Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
videos Arg-I
which Arg-I
also Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
students Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
could Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
can Arg-I
search Arg-I
for Arg-I
more Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
The Arg-B
internet Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
smaller Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
or Arg-I
have Arg-I
financial Arg-I
problems Arg-I
could Arg-I
travel Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
see Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
picture Arg-I
and Arg-I
videos Arg-I
of Arg-I
many Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
's Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
them Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
that Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
even Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
it Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
in Arg-I
studying Arg-I
, Arg-I
doing Arg-I
business Arg-I
and Arg-I
exploring Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
valuable Arg-I
information Arg-I
it Arg-I
provides Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Universities O
require O
students O
to O
study O
many O
subjects O
or O
specialize O
in O
one O
subject O
University O
is O
the O
place O
that O
provides O
people O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
to O
use O
in O
their O
real O
life O
. O

Some O
universities O
require O
students O
to O
study O
in O
one O
subject O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
others O
require O
students O
to O
study O
in O
several O
subjects O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
studying Arg-B
many Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
because O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
one Arg-I
field Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
when Arg-B
students Arg-I
finished Arg-I
their Arg-I
high Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
confused Arg-I
about Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
they Arg-B
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
them Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
pupil Arg-B
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
science Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
music Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
requiring Arg-B
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
know Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
know Arg-I
just Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
different Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
thy Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
university Arg-B
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
study Arg-I
business Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
know Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
gain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
experience Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
meet Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
they Arg-B
all Arg-I
can Arg-I
share Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
one Arg-I
another Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
graduated Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
courses Arg-I
during Arg-I
university Arg-I
and Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
are Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
or Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
graduates Arg-B
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
works Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
select Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
they Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
will Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
career Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
including Arg-I
the Arg-I
job Arg-I
with Arg-I
high Arg-I
salary Arg-I
include Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
bachelors Arg-B
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
by Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
fields Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

In O
concluding O
, O
learning Arg-B
several Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
in Arg-I
universities Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
specialize Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
subject Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
makes Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
and Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Governments O
should O
spend O
money O
on O
space O
exploration O
or O
for O
basic O
needs O
of O
people O

Although O
developing O
technologies O
to O
discover O
amazing O
thing O
in O
galaxy O
is O
interesting O
, O
there O
are O
many O
people O
in O
the O
world O
are O
in O
poverty O
or O
starvation O
. O

Thus O
, O
these O
technologies O
mean O
nothing O
if O
people O
lack O
of O
prosperity O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
accede O
with O
notion O
that O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
basic Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
first Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
that O
after Arg-B
great Arg-I
economic Arg-I
recession Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
were Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
. O

Then O
, O
many O
people O
did O
not O
have O
money O
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
They Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
rob Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
were Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
in Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
rate Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
quality Arg-B
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
were Arg-I
dropping Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
unhappy Arg-I
. O

So O
that O
, O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
invest Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
more Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
steal Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
criminal Arg-B
rate Arg-I
were Arg-I
drop Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
people Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
quality Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
environment Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
important Arg-I
issue Arg-I
that Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Nowaday O
, O
industrial Arg-B
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
still Arg-I
emit Arg-I
high Arg-I
intense Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
caused Arg-I
of Arg-I
greenhouse Arg-I
effect Arg-I
. O

Greenhouse Arg-B
effect Arg-I
causes Arg-I
of Arg-I
climate Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
every Arg-I
living Arg-I
creature Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
government Arg-B
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
issue Arg-I
by Arg-I
declare Arg-I
regulate Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
emission Arg-I
of Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
controlling O
emission O
carbon O
dioxide O
, O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
invest Arg-I
in Arg-I
alternative Arg-I
energy Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
using Arg-I
solar Arg-I
energy Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
coal Arg-I
energy Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
lived Arg-I
in Arg-I
good Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
family Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
root Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
in Arg-I
family Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
family Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
If Arg-I
family Arg-I
had Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
mean Arg-I
society Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
society Arg-I
had Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
could Arg-I
impact Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
create Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
to Arg-I
fill Arg-I
love Arg-I
to Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
setting Arg-B
event Arg-I
once Arg-I
a Arg-I
week Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
in Arg-I
family Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
family Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
mean Arg-I
society Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
nation Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
much Arg-I
trouble Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
agree O
with O
statement O
that O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
basic Arg-I
people Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

The O
basic O
needs O
: O
jobs O
, O
good O
environment O
, O
and O
love O
in O
family O
. O

These Arg-B
three Arg-I
issues Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
basic Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
that Arg-I
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
quality Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Best O
ways O
of O
reducing O
stress O
: O
listening O
to O
music O
, O
exercise O
, O
meditation O

Nowadays O
, O
we O
are O
living O
in O
in O
the O
world O
which O
is O
absolutely O
complicated O
. O

Everything O
seem O
to O
be O
rush O
, O
and O
it O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
competition O
. O

These O
make O
people O
get O
stress O
. O

Thus O
, O
many O
people O
try O
to O
reduce O
their O
stress O
. O

There O
are O
many O
activities O
that O
could O
relieve O
those O
people O
who O
are O
in O
stress O
. O

in O
my O
opinion O
, O
reducing Arg-B
stress Arg-I
by Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
playing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
meditation Arg-I
are Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
practical Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
listening Arg-B
to Arg-I
music Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
office O
, O
I O
use O
public O
transport O
. O

I O
see O
many O
things O
such O
as O
traffic O
jam O
, O
crowded O
people O
at O
bus O
stop O
, O
and O
all O
so O
crowded O
people O
in O
buses O
. O

These O
make O
me O
stress O
. O

So O
that O
I Arg-B
always Arg-I
listen Arg-I
music Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
mp3 Arg-I
player Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
could Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
listening Arg-I
music Arg-I
without Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
I Arg-B
feel Arg-I
happy Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
listen Arg-I
music Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
another Arg-B
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
stress Arg-I
is Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I O
alway O
have O
many O
things O
in O
my O
mind O
such O
as O
a O
difficult O
of O
my O
work O
that O
I O
have O
to O
finish O
in O
time O
. O

These O
problem O
sometime O
make O
me O
hard O
to O
fall O
asleep O
because O
it O
make O
me O
stress O
. O

Thus O
, O
after Arg-B
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
always Arg-I
do Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
jogging Arg-I
is Arg-I
my Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
sport Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
feel Arg-I
that Arg-I
after Arg-I
working Arg-I
out Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
easily Arg-I
to Arg-I
fall Arg-I
asleep Arg-I
. O

Exercising Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
my Arg-I
stress Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
me Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
meditation Arg-B
also Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

when O
I O
have O
many O
things O
to O
think O
about O
, O
and O
this O
make O
me O
stress O
, O
I O
will O
do O
meditation O
. O

Meditation Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
require Arg-I
any Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
take Arg-I
few Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
meditation Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
just Arg-I
sit Arg-I
down Arg-I
, Arg-I
close Arg-I
my Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
count Arg-I
my Arg-I
breath Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
could Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
me Arg-I
from Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
to O
reduce O
the O
stress O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
listening Arg-B
to Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
exercising Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
doing Arg-I
meditation Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
activities Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
could Arg-I
do Arg-I
to Arg-I
escape Arg-I
from Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
are Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
usable Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
should Arg-I
find Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
feel Arg-I
better Arg-I
physically Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

Should O
teachers O
be O
paid O
according O
to O
how O
much O
their O
students O
learn O
? O

Everyone O
is O
different O
. O

Although O
students O
are O
in O
the O
same O
process O
of O
education O
system O
, O
learning O
abilities O
in O
each O
students O
are O
not O
equal O
. O

Some O
students O
are O
fast O
learner O
, O
but O
some O
students O
are O
not O
. O

Thus O
, O
paying Arg-B
for Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
base Arg-I
on Arg-I
grade Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
got Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
fair Arg-I
for Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

So O
that O
, O
I O
disagree O
with O
this O
notion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
in O
schools O
, O
main Arg-B
task Arg-I
of Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
role Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
in Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

there Arg-B
are Arg-I
certain Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
these Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
for Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
individual Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
every Arg-I
topics Arg-I
by Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
teachers Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
specific Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
finish Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
might Arg-I
make Arg-I
many Arg-I
student Arg-I
miss Arg-I
some Arg-I
field Arg-I
in Arg-I
topics Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
know Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
learning Arg-B
abilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
all Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
all Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
students Arg-I
might Arg-I
understand Arg-I
all Arg-I
topics Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
had Arg-I
learnt Arg-I
but Arg-I
some Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
testing Arg-B
result Arg-I
are Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
problems Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
hard Arg-I
study Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
fault Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
teachers Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
paid Arg-I
by Arg-I
testing Arg-I
result Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
there Arg-B
could Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
problem Arg-I
if Arg-I
schools Arg-I
pay Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
by Arg-I
grade Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
is Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Teacher Arg-B
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
care Arg-I
about Arg-I
how Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
topics Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
may Arg-I
just Arg-I
give Arg-I
high Arg-I
grades Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
higher Arg-I
salary Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
problem Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
happened Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
grade Arg-B
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
evaluating Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
totally Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
statement Arg-I
that Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
paid Arg-I
by Arg-I
how Arg-I
much Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
because O
teacher Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
pay Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
learning Arg-B
abilities Arg-I
of Arg-I
student Arg-I
are Arg-I
different Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
problems Arg-I
if Arg-I
paying Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
by Arg-I
grade Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
. O

Should O
good O
people O
are O
rewarded O
and O
bad O
people O
are O
punished O
in O
movies O
or O
dramas O
? O

When O
we O
watch O
movies O
or O
dramas O
, O
some O
of O
us O
like O
to O
see O
good O
people O
have O
a O
good O
ending O
and O
bad O
people O
are O
punished O
. O

While O
there O
are O
also O
some O
people O
who O
do O
not O
like O
this O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
prefer O
to O
see O
good O
people O
get O
rewarded O
. O

However O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
always Arg-I
get Arg-I
an Arg-I
happy Arg-I
ending Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I

think Arg-I
it Arg-I
’s Arg-I
proper Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
if Arg-B
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
story Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
way Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
boring Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
always Arg-I
win Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
guess Arg-I
the Arg-I
ending Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
movies Arg-I
or Arg-I
dramas Arg-I
. O

Then Arg-B
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
less Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
the Arg-I
movie Arg-I
or Arg-I
dramas Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
story Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Hollywood Arg-B
stories Arg-I
usually Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
happy Arg-I
ending Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
hero Arg-I
beats Arg-I
a Arg-I
crime Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
girl Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
now Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
tired Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
ending Arg-I
again Arg-I
and Arg-I
again Arg-I
. O

So O
we Arg-B
ca Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
always Arg-I
let Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
be Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
in Arg-I
movies Arg-I
or Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
ending Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
. O

And O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
happen Arg-I
more Arg-I
often Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
those Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

So O
if Arg-B
children Arg-I
always Arg-I
watch Arg-I
the Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
that Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
get Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
think Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
true Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
by Arg-I
those Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

And O
they Arg-B
may Arg-I
act Arg-I
like Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
reward Arg-I
. O

Once Arg-B
they Arg-I
find Arg-I
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
get Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
feel Arg-I
upset Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

But O
in O
fact O
, O
the Arg-B
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
good Arg-I
things Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
the Arg-I
ending Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

So O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
tell Arg-I
this Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
the Arg-I
misunderstanding Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
those Arg-B
good Arg-I
endings Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
are Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
good Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

But O
like O
I O
said O
, O
this Arg-B
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
wo Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
last Arg-I
long Arg-I
, O
because O
someday Arg-B
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
realize Arg-I
the Arg-I
truth Arg-I
. O

So O
I O
suggest O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
show Arg-I
people Arg-I
the Arg-I
truth Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
stories Arg-I
. O

And O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
how Arg-I
the Arg-I
story Arg-I
ends Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
my O
arguments O
above O
, O
I O
think O
movies Arg-B
and Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
should Arg-I
present Arg-I
different Arg-I
stories Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
good Arg-I
people Arg-I
get Arg-I
reward Arg-I
or Arg-I
get Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
. O

Should O
replace O
normal O
classroom O
with O
online O
computer O
classes O
? O

There O
are O
many O
advantages O
of O
distance O
learning O
, O
but O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
replace Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
in Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
more Arg-I
information Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
learning Arg-B
in Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
learning Arg-I
academic Arg-I
skills Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
learning Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
I Arg-B
completely Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
statement Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
replace Arg-I
normal Arg-I
course Arg-I
with Arg-I
online Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
learning Arg-B
in Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
more Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
in Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
had Arg-I
learnt Arg-I
. O

Because O
in Arg-B
classroom Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
to Arg-I
demonstrate Arg-I
real Arg-I
example Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
biology Arg-I
class Arg-I
, Arg-I
learning Arg-I
anatomy Arg-I
by Arg-I
operating Arg-I
fog Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

Learner Arg-B
could Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
tools Arg-I
and Arg-I
see Arg-I
actual Arg-I
organs Arg-I
of Arg-I
fog Arg-I
. O

Unlike O
classroom O
, O
online Arg-B
class Arg-I
just Arg-I
only Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
textbook Arg-I
not Arg-I
learnin Arg-I
real Arg-I
situation Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
online Arg-B
class Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
In Arg-B
a Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
, Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
could Arg-I
give Arg-I
assignment Arg-I
to Arg-I
student Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
could Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
collaborate Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
group Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
important Arg-I
skill Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
gotten Arg-I
in Arg-I
online Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
learning Arg-B
in Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
, Arg-I
student Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
life Arg-I
because O
in Arg-B
school Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
class Arg-I
which Arg-I
train Arg-I
student Arg-I
to Arg-I
move Arg-I
their Arg-I
body Arg-I
. O

Classroom Arg-B
have Arg-I
specialist Arg-I
trainer Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
it Arg-I
right Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
student Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
life Arg-I
which Arg-I
online Arg-I
class Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
provide Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
personally Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
this Arg-I
this Arg-I
notion Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
replace Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
with Arg-I
online Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Because O
, O
classroom Arg-B
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
real Arg-I
actual Arg-I
example Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
understand Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
classroom Arg-B
courses Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
provide Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
social Arg-I
skill Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
classroom Arg-B
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
class Arg-I
to Arg-I
set Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
having Arg-B
classroom Arg-I
could Arg-I
provide Arg-I
abundant Arg-I
skills Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Experiences O
that O
have O
shaped O
your O
outlook O
and O
the O
way O
you O
live O

Many Arg-B
circumstances Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
change Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
I Arg-I
think Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
improve Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
improve Arg-I
how Arg-I
I Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
improve Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
for Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
studying Arg-B
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
taught Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
prudent Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
math Arg-I
class Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
learnt Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
an Arg-I
answer Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
step Arg-I
by Arg-I
step Arg-I
. O

Start Arg-B
with Arg-I
find Arg-I
cause Arg-I
of Arg-I
problem Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
research Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
problem Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
could Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
this Arg-I
method Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
my Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
somewhere Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
to Arg-I
destination Arg-I
. O

Which Arg-B
ways Arg-I
are Arg-I
shortest Arg-I
and Arg-I
which Arg-I
ways Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
consume Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
could Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
Some Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
could Arg-I
teach Arg-I
me Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
myself Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
reading Arg-B
and Arg-I
listening Arg-I
the Arg-I
news Arg-I
about Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
diet Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
myself Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I Arg-B
am Arg-I
always Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
quality Arg-I
food Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
organic Arg-I
food Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
food Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
. O

So O
that O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
experience Arg-I
teach Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
aware Arg-I
my Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
experiences Arg-B
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
change Arg-I
to Arg-I
plan Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
read Arg-I
about Arg-I
saving Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
retire Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
plan Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
I Arg-B
start Arg-I
changing Arg-I
myself Arg-I
from Arg-I
spending Arg-I
many Arg-I
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
saving Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
entire Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
experience Arg-I
change Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
concern Arg-I
about Arg-I
making Arg-I
plan Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
experiences Arg-B
that Arg-I
shape Arg-I
my Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
are Arg-I
teach Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

Because O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
experiences Arg-B
could Arg-I
shape Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
aware Arg-I
about Arg-I
my Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
could Arg-I
make Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
plan Arg-I
for Arg-I
my Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
taught Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

One O
important O
thing O
that O
I O
want O
to O
change O
about O
my O
hometown O
Public O
utilities O
and O
surroundings O
are O
the O
primary O
factors O
which O
we O
basically O
consider O
before O
we O
decide O
to O
live O
in O
a O
place O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
community O
which O
can O
perfectly O
meet O
our O
requirements O
. O

In O
my O
hometown O
, O
there O
are O
almost O
complete O
public O
utilities O
for O
one O
’s O
needs O
but O
transportation O
. O

So O
the Arg-B
thing Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
really Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
. O

Since O
I Arg-B
’m Arg-I
facing Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
congestion Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

And O
this O
problem O
seem O
to O
get O
worst O
. O

At O
first O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
alternatives Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
subway Arg-I
train Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
sky Arg-I
train Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
people Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Since O
now Arg-B
buses Arg-I
are Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
community Arg-I
, O
It Arg-B
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
area Arg-I
have Arg-I
no Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
must Arg-I
take Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
another Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
a Arg-I
subway Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
sky Arg-I
train Arg-I
are Arg-I
available Arg-I
here Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
estimate Arg-I
time Arg-I
from Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
subway Arg-I
train Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
train Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
. O

On Arg-B
the Arg-I
contrary Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
so Arg-I
in Arg-I
case Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
this Arg-B
improvement Arg-I
will Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
road Arg-I
indirectly Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
buses Arg-I
provide Arg-I
merely Arg-I
two Arg-I
routes Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
problem Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
I Arg-I
intend Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
route Arg-I
of Arg-I
buses Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
still Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
that Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
bring Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
destination Arg-I
but Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
center Arg-I
station Arg-I
first Arg-I
to Arg-I
exchange Arg-I
to Arg-I
another Arg-I
bus Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
should Arg-I
increase Arg-I
more Arg-I
routes Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
transport Arg-I
more Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
having Arg-B
more Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
can Arg-I
dwindle Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
using Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
cars Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
it O
provides O
many O
advantages O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
their Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
form Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
is Arg-I
getting Arg-I
more Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
necessary Arg-I
energy Arg-I
will Arg-I
slowly Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
up Arg-I
, O
since O
people Arg-B
use Arg-I
less Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
cars Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
the Arg-B
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
elementary Arg-I
factor Arg-I
which Arg-I
directly Arg-I
affects Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
’s Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

I O
wish O
one O
day O
this O
problem O
would O
be O
changed O
. O

And O
then O
, O
the O
transportation O
in O
my O
hometown O
is O
no O
longer O
difficult O
for O
everyone O
in O
this O
community O
. O

Some O
people O
prefer O
to O
work O
for O
a O
large O
company O
Companies O
vary O
from O
small O
to O
large O
ones O
based O
on O
the O
context O
, O
success O
and O
needs O
of O
their O
work O
. O

Small O
companies O
usually O
have O
a O
local O
job O
in O
the O
area O
, O
while O
large O
companies O
work O
in O
an O
international O
context O
providing O
for O
the O
entire O
nation O
or O
even O
for O
other O
foreign O
countries O
. O

I Arg-B
personally Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
company Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
to Arg-B
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
way Arg-I
more Arg-I
easier Arg-I
than Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

Large Arg-B
companies Arg-I
always Arg-I
look Arg-I
for Arg-I
new Arg-I
skilled Arg-I
employees Arg-I
to Arg-I
fill Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
distributing Arg-I
, Arg-I
managing Arg-I
and Arg-I
selling Arg-I
their Arg-I
products Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
company Arg-I
decides Arg-I
to Arg-I
open Arg-I
a Arg-I
branch Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
need Arg-I
more Arg-I
employees Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
there Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
Large Arg-B
company Arg-I
equals Arg-I
more Arg-I
job Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
I O
think O
that O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
company Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
better Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
than Arg-I
a Arg-I
smaller Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
one Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
this Arg-B
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
more Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
to Arg-I
its Arg-I
employees Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
common Arg-B
sense Arg-I
would Arg-I
tell Arg-I
us Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
famous Arg-I
and Arg-I
international Arg-I
known Arg-I
company Arg-I
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
give Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
salary Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
local Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
I O
love O
travelling O
around O
the O
world O
. O

large Arg-B
companies Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
international Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
organize Arg-I
international Arg-I
conferences Arg-I
, Arg-I
meetings Arg-I
and Arg-I
workshops Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
me Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
meet Arg-I
new Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
learning Arg-I
new Arg-I
skills Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
field Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
workshops Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
i O
can O
certainly O
state O
that O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
rather Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
company Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
different Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
to Arg-I
hold Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
salary Arg-I
and Arg-I
having Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
international Arg-I
conferences Arg-I
. O

Higher O
education O
should O
be O
available O
only O
to O
good O
students O
or O
not O

No O
one O
can O
disagree O
that O
knowledge O
is O
the O
most O
important O
for O
everyone O
. O

College O
and O
university O
are O
playing O
in O
an O
important O
role O
to O
provide O
academic O
skills O
to O
people O
in O
order O
to O
pursue O
their O
goal O
. O

There O
are O
an O
issue O
that O
some O
people O
agree O
that O
this O
opportunity O
should O
be O
preserved O
for O
good O
students O
however O
there O
are O
others O
people O
who O
think O
that O
everyone O
should O
have O
this O
chance O
to O
gain O
these O
advance O
skills O
from O
college O
or O
university O
. O

This O
issue O
will O
be O
discussed O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many O
people O
think O
that O
college Arg-B
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
only Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
studying Arg-B
in Arg-I
advance Arg-I
education Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

College Arg-B
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
not Arg-I
qualify Arg-I
for Arg-I
to Arg-I
waste Arg-I
their Arg-I
money Arg-I
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
courses Arg-I
and Arg-I
waste Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

They O
believe O
that O
only Arg-B
good Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
potentials Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
programs Arg-I
more Arg-I
that Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
good Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
mediocre Arg-B
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
these Arg-I
advance Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
from Arg-I
college Arg-I
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O

some O
people O
think O
that O
all Arg-B
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
equal Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
higher Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
higher Arg-B
education Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
however O
moderate Arg-B
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
. O

Everyone Arg-B
that Arg-I
has Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
ambition Arg-I
could Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
and Arg-I
success Arg-I
their Arg-I
goal Arg-I
even Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
classified Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
student Arg-I
because Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
environment Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
or Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
encouraging Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
harder Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
mediocre Arg-B
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
trained Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
agree O
with O
that O
college Arg-B
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
their Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
practice Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
and Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Studying Arg-B
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
that Arg-I
all Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
. O

Disagree O
Playing O
Computer O
Games O
wastes O
time O
and O
students O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
! O

It O
is O
a O
debatable O
subject O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
since O
playing Arg-B
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

I O
hold O
a O
positive O
view O
against O
this O
opinion O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
obsessed Arg-I
in Arg-I
on Arg-I
- Arg-I
line Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
their Arg-I
performance Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
are Arg-I
declined Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
investigation Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
University Arg-I
shows Arg-I
that Arg-I
80 Arg-I
% Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
failed Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
final Arg-I
exam Arg-I
paid Arg-I
2 Arg-I
hours Arg-I
or Arg-I
more Arg-I
on Arg-I
- Arg-I
online Arg-I
games Arg-I
every Arg-I
week Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
90 Arg-I
% Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
students Arg-I
expressed Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
touch Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
days Arg-I
. O

Recent Arg-B
research Arg-I
by Arg-I
Scientist Arg-I
also Arg-I
reveals Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
youngs Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
attacted Arg-I
by Arg-I
and Arg-I
lose Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
low Arg-I
control Arg-I
ability Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
children Arg-B
could Arg-I
learn Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
, O
therefore O
time Arg-B
on Arg-I
this Arg-I
activity Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
time Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
. O

Since O
all Arg-B
these Arg-I
games Arg-I
are Arg-I
developed Arg-I
for Arg-I
commercial Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
catch Arg-I
the Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
majority Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
games Arg-I
use Arg-I
war Arg-I
, Arg-I
violence Arg-I
, Arg-I
bloody Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
sexual Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
to Arg-I
lure Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
those Arg-B
subjects Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
bad Arg-I
effects Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
youths Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I

a Arg-I
few Arg-I
students Arg-I
paying Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
playing Arg-I
finally Arg-I
choose Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
related Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

But O
we O
have O
to O
realize O
the O
fact O
: O
majority Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
failed Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
playing Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
studying Arg-I
, Arg-I
sleeping Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
exerice Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
these Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
uncommon Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
teenages Arg-I
are Arg-I
found Arg-I
sleepless Arg-I
for Arg-I
several Arg-I
days Arg-I
playing Arg-I
on Arg-I
- Arg-I
line Arg-I
games Arg-I
at Arg-I
public Arg-I
internet Arg-I
bar Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
some Arg-I
media Arg-I
reports Arg-I
regarding Arg-I
the Arg-I
sudden Arg-I
death Arg-I
case Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
teenages Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
bar Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

The O
computer O
games O
are O
like O
cigerate O
to O
adults O
and O
we O
need O
to O
set O
up O
rules O
to O
regulate O
this O
area O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
classmates O
or O
colleagues O
should O
work O
on O
projects O
in O
person O
or O
by O
e O
- O
mail O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
question O
whether O
classmates O
or O
colleagues O
should O
work O
on O
projects O
in O
person O
or O
by O
email O
, O
I O
am O
of O
the O
view O
that O
wok Arg-B
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
preferred Arg-I
because O
this Arg-B
means Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
team Arg-B
members Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
different Arg-I
views Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
a Arg-I
union Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
discussion Arg-B
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
by Arg-I
emails Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
experiment Arg-I
conducted Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
University Arg-I
asked Arg-I
two Arg-I
groups Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
first Arg-I
group Arg-I
was Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
the Arg-I
second Arg-I
group Arg-I
was Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
by Arg-I
email Arg-I
. O

The O
result O
shows O
that O
the Arg-B
1st Arg-I
group Arg-I
used Arg-I
30 Arg-I
minutes Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
the Arg-I
agreement Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
it Arg-I
takes Arg-I
30 Arg-I
hours Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
later Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
similar Arg-I
experiment Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
other Arg-I
scientist Arg-I
show Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
result Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
reach Arg-I
an Arg-I
agreement Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
work Arg-B
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
can Arg-I
indirectly Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
because O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
or Arg-I
fight Arg-I
amongst Arg-I
the Arg-I
team Arg-I
members Arg-I
. O

Writing Arg-B
an Arg-I
email Arg-I
for Arg-I
an Arg-I
informal Arg-I
matter Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
that Arg-I
matter Arg-I
looks Arg-I
official Arg-I
, O
therefore O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
receives Arg-I
the Arg-I
email Arg-I
may Arg-I
feel Arg-I
nervous Arg-I
or Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
feel Arg-I
offended Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
words Arg-I
in Arg-I
writing Arg-I
. O

While O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
words Arg-I
are Arg-I
expressed Arg-I
in Arg-I
talking Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
counterparty Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
relaxed Arg-I
since O
their Arg-B
response Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
recorded Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
misunderstand Arg-I
the Arg-I
informal Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
official Arg-I
claim Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
less Arg-B
misunderstanding Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
less Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
and Arg-I
fights Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
enhance Arg-I
the Arg-I
communication Arg-I
amongst Arg-I
the Arg-I
team Arg-I
members Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
sometimes Arg-B
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
emails Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
team Arg-I
members Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
located Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Although O
emails Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
none Arg-I
. O

Since O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
or Arg-I
campus Arg-I
projects Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
few Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
members Arg-I
are Arg-I
located Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

While O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
coordination Arg-I
works Arg-I
are Arg-I
required Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
each Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
is Arg-I
communicated Arg-I
via Arg-I
email Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
hundreds Arg-I
or Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
emails Arg-I
there Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
know Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
members Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
rather Arg-I
them Arg-I
by Arg-I
email Arg-I
because O
work Arg-B
in Arg-I
person Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
. O

Professors O
should O
do O
more O
research O
or O
teach O
students O
? O

These O
days O
, O
more O
and O
more O
university O
professors O
are O
involved O
in O
scientific O
research O
. O

Some O
are O
afraid O
that O
this O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
decline O
of O
education O
quality O
and O
suggest O
them O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
teaching O
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
my O
experiences O
, O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
to Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
do Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
doing Arg-B
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
for Arg-I
professors Arg-I
. O

Universities Arg-B
are Arg-I
relatively Arg-I
fenced Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
research Arg-I
projects Arg-I
provide Arg-I
communication Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
outside Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
by Arg-B
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
professors Arg-I
could Arg-I
catch Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
latest Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
still Arg-I
remembered Arg-I
that Arg-I
my Arg-I
professor Arg-I
took Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
research Arg-I
projects Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
was Arg-I
often Arg-I
invited Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
speech Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Although O
my Arg-B
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
ranking Arg-I
list Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
gained Arg-I
a Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
by Arg-I
those Arg-I
projects Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
research Arg-I
projects Arg-I
like Arg-I
windows Arg-I
opened Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
wider Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
fully Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
research Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
environment Arg-I
provided Arg-I
by Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
common Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
state Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
the Arg-I
- Arg-I
art Arg-I
laboratories Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
you Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
another Arg-I
place Arg-I
with Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
talent Arg-I
people Arg-I
gathering Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
no Arg-I
reason Arg-I
to Arg-I
discourage Arg-I
professors Arg-I
from Arg-I
using Arg-I
those Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
all Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
Einstein Arg-I
developed Arg-I
the Arg-I
theory Arg-I
of Arg-I
general Arg-I
relativity Arg-I
when Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
professor Arg-I
in Arg-I
HU Arg-I
Berlin Arg-I
. O

Universities Arg-B
positively Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
the Arg-I
professors Arg-I
' Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
doing Arg-B
research Arg-I
could Arg-I
also Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
projects Arg-I
, Arg-I
professors Arg-I
could Arg-I
lead Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
practical Arg-I
world Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
imply Arg-I
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
practice Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
still Arg-I
remembered Arg-I
the Arg-I
experience Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
an Arg-I
assistant Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
professor Arg-I
's Arg-I
research Arg-I
project Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
participating Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
theories Arg-I
on Arg-I
textbooks Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
experiments Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
research Arg-I
project Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
. O

For O
those O
reasons O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
natural Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
the Arg-I
professors Arg-I
spending Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
extending Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
development Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
outcomes Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
researches Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Learning O
with O
a O
teacher O
is O
more O
efficient O
than O
by O
myself O
. O

Every O
person O
learn O
in O
their O
own O
manner O
which O
they O
think O
that O
is O
most O
expedient O
to O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
learning O
by O
yourself O
, O
it O
has O
some O
certain O
profit O
. O

It O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
concentrate O
on O
what O
you O
learn O
cause O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
distracts O
your O
attention O
in O
presence O
of O
you O
, O
and O
your O
learning O
becomes O
more O
profound O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
learning O
with O
a O
teacher O
makes O
us O
bear O
more O
burdens O
of O
studies O
cause O
they O
assign O
us O
homework O
, O
Nevertheless O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
learn Arg-I
by Arg-I
myself Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
The O
distinguishing O
fact O
of O
the O
learning Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
ask Arg-I
about Arg-I
problems Arg-I
related Arg-I
your Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
when Arg-B
we Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
study Arg-I
which Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
make Arg-I
out Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
asking Arg-I
the Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
from Arg-I
our Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
is Arg-I
propitious Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
it Arg-I
instantly Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
professors Arg-B
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
have Arg-I
much Arg-I
experience Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
dextrous Arg-I
with Arg-I
letting Arg-I
students Arg-I
understand Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
know Arg-I
something Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
incorporated Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
materials Arg-I
as Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
webpages Arg-I
. O

Hence O
I Arg-B
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
class Arg-I
, Arg-I
often Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
coordinated Arg-I
answer Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
my Arg-I
faced Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
my Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
accustomed Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
the Arg-B
learning Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
than Arg-I
by Arg-I
myself Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
accomplish Arg-I
our Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
with Arg-I
little Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
within Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
than Arg-I
do Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
ourself Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
teachers Arg-I
play Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
leading Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
right Arg-I
direction Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
This Arg-B
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
rise Arg-I
our Arg-I
educational Arg-I
level Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
exited Arg-I
degree Arg-I
. O

knowledge Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
thereby Arg-I
better Arg-I
improved Arg-I
and Arg-I
strengthened Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
of O
course O
, O
being Arg-B
without Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
has Arg-I
shortcomings Arg-I
. O

Notable O
one O
of O
the O
shortcomings O
is O
that O
if Arg-B
someone Arg-I
faced Arg-I
so Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
confusion Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
his Arg-I
many Arg-I
endeavors Arg-I
on Arg-I
making Arg-I
out Arg-I
it Arg-I
were Arg-I
miscarried Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
ended Arg-I
in Arg-I
disappointment Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
that O
for Arg-B
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
only Arg-I
himself Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
ability Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
regard Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
and Arg-I
express Arg-I
his Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
unpromising Arg-I
. O

Hence O
I Arg-B
support Arg-I
this Arg-I
point Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
learning Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Technology O
designed O
to O
make O
people O
's O
lives O
simpler O
often O
make O
them O
more O
complicated O
Many O
people O
think O
they O
are O
blessed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
era O
of O
high O
technology O
. O

With O
newly O
developing O
technologies O
, O
people O
are O
able O
to O
carry O
various O
tasks O
more O
convenient O
and O
easy O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
to O
travel O
to O
DMV O
to O
renew O
our O
driver O
's O
license O
or O
drive O
to O
bank O
for O
sending O
money O
. O

Ancient O
people O
would O
probably O
think O
that O
we O
are O
like O
magicians O
. O

However O
, O
even O
with O
all O
the O
conveniences O
, O
we O
would O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
technologies Arg-B
made Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
more Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
couple O
reasons O
and O
examples O
to O
support O
my O
answer O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
new Arg-B
technologies Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
great Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
takes Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Since O
we Arg-B
are Arg-I
informed Arg-I
with Arg-I
devices Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
produced Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
features Arg-I
nearly Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
, O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
often Arg-I
get Arg-I
lost Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
use Arg-I
new Arg-I
Iphone Arg-I
which Arg-I
I Arg-I
personally Arg-I
think Arg-I
is Arg-I
great Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
even Arg-B
though Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
it Arg-I
for Arg-I
couple Arg-I
months Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
still Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
features Arg-I
proficiently Arg-I
. O

At O
first O
, O
I Arg-B
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
through Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
instructions Arg-I
but Arg-I
, Arg-I
soon Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
gave Arg-I
up Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
found Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
time Arg-I
- Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
too Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
. O

Next O
, O
technology Arg-B
destroys Arg-I
the Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Ever O
since O
people Arg-B
used Arg-I
computers Arg-I
or Arg-I
cellphones Arg-I
to Arg-I
chat Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
created Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
language Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
. O

Because O
people Arg-B
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
type Arg-I
as Arg-I
fast Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
talking Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
use Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
abbreviations Arg-I
and Arg-I
broken Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
has Arg-I
gotten Arg-I
worse Arg-I
with Arg-I
twitter Arg-I
, Arg-I
myspace Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
facebook Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
are Arg-I
even Arg-I
worse Arg-I
, Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
ages Arg-I
are Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
impeded Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
newly Arg-I
developed Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
. O

To O
clarify O
, O
my Arg-B
younger Arg-I
brother Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
spell Arg-I
the Arg-I
words Arg-I
correctly Arg-I
and Arg-I
he Arg-I
talks Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
friends Arg-I
with Arg-I
terms Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
never Arg-I
heard Arg-I
of Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
correct Arg-I
him Arg-I
for Arg-I
couple Arg-I
times Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
just Arg-I
thinks Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
too Arg-I
conservative Arg-I
. O

Although O
technologies Arg-B
allowed Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
made Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
more Arg-I
chaotic Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
mentioned Arg-I
above Arg-I
. O

Classroom O
learnng O
vs O
online O
education O

There O
are O
some O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
distance O
learning O
and O
online O
computer O
classes O
should O
replace O
classroom O
learning O
while O
there O
are O
some O
people O
who O
strongly O
disagree O
with O
this O
opinion O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
online Arg-B
classes Arg-I
should Arg-I
never Arg-I
replace Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

I O
list O
my O
reasons O
as O
follows O
. O

First O
, O
indeed O
classroom Arg-B
learning Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
education Arg-I
comparing Arg-I
to Arg-I
online Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
environment Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
from Arg-I
your Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
, O
because O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
see Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
performing Arg-I
better Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
force Arg-I
you Arg-I
for Arg-I
making Arg-I
your Arg-I
performance Arg-I
more Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
When Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
First Arg-I
Year Arg-I
in Arg-I
B Arg-I
Com Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
serious Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
study Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
saw Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
who Arg-I
took Arg-I
better Arg-I
grades Arg-I
than Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
me Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
intended Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

Finally O
I Arg-B
got Arg-I
1st Arg-I
rank Arg-I
in Arg-I
final Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
in Arg-B
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
complete Arg-I
study Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
makes Arg-I
you Arg-I
perfect Arg-I
in Arg-I
time Arg-I
management Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
by Arg-I
participating Arg-I
in Arg-I
group Arg-I
studies Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
makes Arg-I
you Arg-I
communication Arg-I
and Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
your Arg-I
group Arg-I
skills Arg-I
better Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
future Arg-I
and Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
professors Arg-B
play Arg-I
vital Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
specialists Arg-I
is Arg-I
their Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
by Arg-I
giving Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
useful Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
your Arg-I
skills Arg-I
by Arg-I
work Arg-I
under Arg-I
any Arg-I
professor Arg-I
; Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
ask Arg-I
questions Arg-I
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
clear Arg-I
your Arg-I
doubts Arg-I
. O

In O
result O
you Arg-B
learn Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
have O
my O
personal O
experience O
. O

For Arg-B
Toefl Arg-I
IBT Arg-I
Coaching Arg-I
first Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
some Arg-I
online Arg-I
courses Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
after Arg-I
1 Arg-I
month Arg-I
I Arg-I
realized Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I

so Arg-I
I Arg-I
joined Arg-I
an Arg-I
institute Arg-I
for Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
of Arg-I
Toefl Arg-I
IBT Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
1 Arg-I
month Arg-I
I Arg-I
felt Arg-I
that Arg-I
my Arg-I
English Arg-I
skills Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
improving Arg-I
faster Arg-I
. O

It O
's O
undeniable O
that O
online Arg-B
classes Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
as Arg-I
supplementary Arg-I
, O
but O
they Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
substitute Arg-I
of Arg-I
existing Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

From O
the O
discussed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
easily O
draw O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the Arg-B
classroom Arg-I
learning Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
education Arg-I
for Arg-I
these Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
. O

Part O
time O
job O
for O
teenage O
students O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
student O
, O
we O
generally O
mean O
a O
boy O
or O
a O
girl O
who O
study O
in O
school O
or O
college O
. O

In O
some O
country O
, O
teenage O
students O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
do O
some O
part O
time O
job O
beside O
their O
study O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
do O
not O
support O
the O
concept O
of O
teenagers O
doing O
job O
beside O
study O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
teenager Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
while Arg-I
he Arg-I
/ Arg-I
she Arg-I
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
and O
this O
is O
for O
two O
reasons O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
is O
that O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
from Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
before Arg-I
starting Arg-I
their Arg-I
real Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
time Arg-I
management Arg-I
, Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
and Arg-I
convince Arg-I
people Arg-I
by Arg-I
their Arg-I
words Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
I Arg-I
worked Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
sales Arg-I
- Arg-I
man Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
shop Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
year Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
i Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
job Arg-I
, O
therefore O
, O
i Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
my Arg-I
boss Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
my Arg-I
homework Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
taught Arg-I
me Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
time Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
and Arg-I
do Arg-I
any Arg-I
job Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
and Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
I Arg-B
learn Arg-I
money Arg-I
management Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
my Arg-I
boss Arg-I
was Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
shop Arg-I
, Arg-I
i Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
accounts Arg-I
section Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
shop Arg-I
. O

From Arg-B
this Arg-I
i Arg-I
learned Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
money Arg-I
correctly Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
experience Arg-I
taught Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
doing Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
from Arg-B
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when O
i O
was O
in O
high O
school O
I O
worked O
as O
a O
home O
tutor O
. O

I O
taught O
math O
to O
two O
kids O
of O
my O
neighbor O
. O

I O
helped O
them O
to O
understand O
the O
difficult O
topics O
of O
the O
books O
. O

By Arg-B
tutoring Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
i Arg-I
earned Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
bought Arg-I
me Arg-I
books Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
after Arg-B
taking Arg-I
that Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
i Arg-I
stopped Arg-I
taking Arg-I
my Arg-I
pocket Arg-I
money Arg-I
form Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
part Arg-B
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
financially Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
; O
some O
people O
will O
oppose O
the O
idea O
of O
part O
time O
job O
for O
students O
. O

They O
will O
argue O
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
destruct Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
as O
i Arg-B
did Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I

and Arg-I
it Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
my Arg-I
academic Arg-I
result Arg-I
; O
therefore O
, O
i O
believe O
part Arg-B
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Every O
Student O
should O
do O
part O
time O
job O
beside O
their O
study O
if O
they O
want O
to O
prepare O
more O
efficiently O
for O
their O
future O
. O

Which O
is O
better- O

Learning O
foreign O
language O
in O
home O
or O
host O
country O
? O

Our O
World O
has O
varied O
cultures O
and O
each O
culture O
has O
its O
own O
language O
. O

It O
has O
become O
essential O
for O
a O
person O
to O
learn O
at O
least O
one O
foreign O
language O
as O
one O
do O
interacts O
with O
foreigners O
once O
in O
a O
lifetime O
and O
learning O
a O
foreign O
langauge O
adds O
on O
to O
a O
person O
skill O
- O
set O
as O
well O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
think O
its Arg-B
better Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
learn Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

The O
reasons O
for O
holding O
that O
opinion O
are O
illustrated O
in O
the O
subsequent O
paragraphs O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
possible Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
to Arg-I
visit Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
as O
it Arg-B
requires Arg-I
large Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
legal Arg-I
formalities Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
earlier Arg-I
periods Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
languge Arg-I
. O

But O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
advent Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalization Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
Indian Arg-I
sub Arg-I
- Arg-I
continent Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
centers Arg-I
opened Arg-I
for Arg-I
getting Arg-I
trained Arg-I
in Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
languages Arg-I
like Arg-I
french Arg-I
, Arg-I
german Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
colleges Arg-B
and Arg-I
universities Arg-I
have Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
course Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
curriculum Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
choose Arg-I
any Arg-I
language Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
set Arg-I
of Arg-I
languages Arg-I
available Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
highly Arg-B
qualified Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
are Arg-I
easily Arg-I
accessible Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
also Arg-I
played Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
the Arg-I
separation Arg-I
between Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
languge Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
courses Arg-I
are Arg-I
available Arg-I
online Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
various Arg-I
forums Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
their Arg-I
problems Arg-I
on Arg-I
different Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
cost Arg-I
effective Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
pool Arg-I
of Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
available Arg-I
now Arg-I
to Arg-I
accomplish Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
. O

One O
long O
vacation O
or O
several O
long O
vacation O

Everybody O
require O
some O
break O
from O
their O
tight O
schedules O
likewise O
students O
also O
require O
vacation O
form O
their O
intense O
academic O
schedules O
. O

Many O
people O
promote O
one O
long O
vacation O
system O
of O
the O
school O
because O
it O
would O
help O
student O
to O
start O
their O
course O
or O
academic O
year O
with O
strong O
zeal O
of O
learning O
. O

So O
other O
several O
, O
prefer O
numbers O
of O
short O
breaks O
during O
the O
year O
so O
that O
student O
can O
get O
rejuvenate O
periodically O
. O

In O
both O
the O
scenario O
students O
relief O
themselves O
. O

However O
, O
i Arg-B
discern Arg-I
that Arg-I
several Arg-I
small Arg-I
breaks Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
active Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
academics Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
several Arg-B
vacations Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
the Arg-I
year Arg-I
will Arg-I
keep Arg-I
stress Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
low Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
educational Arg-I
bodies Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
its Arg-I
small Arg-I
vacations Arg-I
after Arg-I
term Arg-I
exams Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
get Arg-I
relief Arg-I
form Arg-I
exam Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
research Arg-B
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
universities Arg-I
proves Arg-I
that Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
performance Arg-I
improves Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
regular Arg-I
breaks Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
and Arg-I
examination Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
colleges Arg-I
in Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
countries Arg-I
provide Arg-I
vacations Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
after Arg-I
each Arg-I
semester Arg-I
that Arg-I
facilitate Arg-I
student Arg-I
to Arg-I
entertain Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
next Arg-I
semester Arg-I
. O

Also O
several Arg-B
holidays Arg-I
aid Arg-I
these Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
amuse Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
arrange Arg-I
fund Arg-I
and Arg-I
materials Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
references Arg-I
material Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
upcoming Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
scientific O
research O
provide O
several O
authentic O
survey O
of O
the O
students O
' O
performance O
after O
break O
. O

It O
states O
that O
students Arg-B
learning Arg-I
capability Arg-I
increase Arg-I
after Arg-I
having Arg-I
refreshing Arg-I
vacation Arg-I
. O

To O
quote O
an O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
my Arg-I
school Arg-I
we Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
several Arg-I
vacations Arg-I
after Arg-I
our Arg-I
quarterly Arg-I
exams Arg-I
. O

During Arg-B
those Arg-I
vacations Arg-I
i Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
analyze Arg-I
my Arg-I
performance Arg-I
in Arg-I
latest Arg-I
examination Arg-I
and Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
through Arg-I
those Arg-I
question Arg-I
or Arg-I
concept Arg-I
again Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
making Arg-I
same Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
also Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
my Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
developing Arg-I
some Arg-I
recreational Arg-I
activity Arg-I
or Arg-I
learning Arg-I
some Arg-I
sports Arg-I
or Arg-I
game Arg-I
. O

During Arg-B
my Arg-I
all Arg-I
vacations Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
miss Arg-I
my Arg-I
school Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
which Arg-I
I Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
restart Arg-I
my Arg-I
session Arg-I
with Arg-I
great Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
and Arg-I
scoring Arg-I
good Arg-I
marks Arg-I
in Arg-I
new Arg-I
quarter Arg-I
. O

Vacations Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
required Arg-I
by Arg-I
students Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
by Arg-I
professionals Arg-I
and Arg-I
housekeepers Arg-I
. O

As O
it Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
provide Arg-I
break Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
regular Arg-I
commitment Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
allows Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, Arg-I
heel Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
boost Arg-I
desire Arg-I
of Arg-I
resuming Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
regular Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
schools Arg-B
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
giving Arg-I
several Arg-I
small Arg-I
vocations Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
year Arg-I
. O

Saving O
/ O
Spending O
money O

In O
recent O
years O
the O
majority O
of O
developed O
countries O
have O
a O
low O
saving O
rate O
because O
the O
people O
opt O
to O
spend O
their O
earnings O
immediately O
or O
they O
even O
take O
loans O
to O
finance O
their O
expenses O
. O

But O
is O
n't O
it O
better O
to O
save O
your O
money O
for O
later O
investments O
or O
rough O
times O
? O

I O
m O
my O
opinion O
, O
saving Arg-B
some Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
earnings Arg-I
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
predict Arg-I
future Arg-I
developments Arg-I
, Arg-I
neither Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
professional Arg-I
nor Arg-I
your Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
furthermore Arg-I
with Arg-I
savings Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
fulfill Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
dreams Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
several Arg-I
uncertainties Arg-I
about Arg-I
your Arg-I
professional Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
global Arg-I
economic Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
days Arg-I
are Arg-I
tough Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
unpredictable Arg-I
factors Arg-I
that Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
bank Arg-I
account Arg-I
. O

As O
example O
I Arg-B
remember Arg-I
some Arg-I
friends Arg-I
who Arg-I
lost Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
recently Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
in Arg-I
Europe Arg-I
. O

Some O
of O
them O
had O
no O
own O
savings O
. O

They Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
the Arg-I
rent Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
move Arg-I
back Arg-I
in Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
lost Arg-I
their Arg-I
independence Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
sure Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
possible Arg-I
that Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
unavoidable Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
without Arg-I
savings Arg-I
. O

Back Arg-B
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
I Arg-I
remember Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
of Arg-I
mine Arg-I
who Arg-I
had Arg-I
just Arg-I
little Arg-I
savings Arg-I

and Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
repair Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
car Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
the Arg-I
maintenance Arg-I
so O
he Arg-B
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
sell Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
with Arg-B
savings Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
afford Arg-I
some Arg-I
luxurious Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
fulfill Arg-I
your Arg-I
dreams Arg-I
. O

Working Arg-B
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
saving Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
later Arg-I
on Arg-I
investments Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
satisfying Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
reward Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
for Arg-I
something Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
accomplished Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
made Arg-I
a Arg-I
month Arg-I
- Arg-I
long Arg-I
backpack Arg-I
trip Arg-I
through Arg-I
Southeast Arg-I
Asia Arg-I
last Arg-I
summer Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
girlfriend Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
our Arg-I
savings Arg-I
we Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
pursued Arg-I
our Arg-I
long Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
dream Arg-I
. O

Considering O
all O
the O
above O
mentioned O
arguments O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O

there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
other Arg-I
choice Arg-I
than Arg-I
saving Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
some Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Rush O
vs O
Slower O
Pace O
Modern O
technologies O
and O
globalization O
have O
increased O
the O
speed O
of O
life O
in O
the O
past O
decades O
tremendously O
. O

However O
, O
while O
the O
majority O
of O
people O
live O
on O
the O
fast O
lane O
, O
others O
decide O
to O
reduce O
the O
speed O
and O
take O
their O
time O
. O

To O
draw O
an O
entire O
picture O
, O
we O
have O
to O
consider O
both O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
this O
increased O
speed O
of O
life O
and O
ask O
our O
self O
which O
way O
of O
life O
is O
better O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
life Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
slower Arg-I
pace Arg-I
, O
because O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
hurry Arg-I
comes Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
several Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
living Arg-B
your Arg-I
life Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
fast Arg-I
lane Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
affect Arg-I
your Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
hurried Arg-I
and Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
time Arg-I
off Arg-I
, Arg-I
your Arg-I
body Arg-I
will Arg-I
react Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
hardworking Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
the Arg-I
burn Arg-I
- Arg-I
out Arg-I
syndrome Arg-I
, O
because O
their Arg-B
bodies Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
hold Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my Arg-B
father Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
a Arg-I
breakdown Arg-I
several Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
several Arg-I
weeks Arg-I
off Arg-I
his Arg-I
body Arg-I
was Arg-I
restored Arg-I
, Arg-I
now Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
the Arg-I
tempo Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
doing Arg-I
fine Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
living Arg-B
your Arg-I
life Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
slower Arg-I
pace Arg-I
increases Arg-I
your Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
facing Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
stress Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
care Arg-I
for Arg-I
your Arg-I
beloved Arg-I
's Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
hurry Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
take Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
your Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Caring Arg-B
for Arg-I
your Arg-I
social Arg-I
environment Arg-I
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
your Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
your Arg-I
stress Arg-I
level Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
friend Arg-I
of Arg-I
mine Arg-I
lives Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
slow Arg-I
pace Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
, O
because O
he Arg-B
can Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultivate Arg-I
his Arg-I
friendships Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
quality Arg-B
takes Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
faced Arg-I
with Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
and Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
rush Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
avoidable Arg-I
errors Arg-I
or Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

Doing Arg-B
tasks Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
hurry Arg-I
may Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
not Arg-I
considering Arg-I
all Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
or Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
you Arg-B
might Arg-I
make Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
done Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
patience Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
I Arg-B
once Arg-I
wrote Arg-I
an Arg-I
essay Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
hurry Arg-I
and Arg-I
got Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
grade Arg-I
, O
because O
I Arg-B
made Arg-I
few Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
avoided Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
to O
say O
that O
, O
given O
the O
arguments O
above O
, O
living Arg-B
a Arg-I
slower Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
advantageous Arg-I
for Arg-I
your Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
your Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Human O
needs O
vs O
saving O
land O
for O
endangered O
animals O

In O
the O
past O
centuries O
the O
population O
steadily O
grew O
and O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
history O
, O
is O
exceeding O
seven O
billion O
. O

As O
a O
result O
more O
and O
more O
natural O
environment O
had O
to O
be O
vanished O
to O
make O
room O
for O
housing O
, O
feeding O
and O

. O

But O
is O
n't O
it O
important O
to O
preserve O
the O
land O
to O
maintain O
the O
other O
species O
living O
on O
our O
planet O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we Arg-B
clearly Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
our Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
towards Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
because O
of O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the Arg-B
natural Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
further Arg-I
generations Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
change Arg-I
our Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
many Arg-I
species Arg-I
living Arg-I
for Arg-I
millions Arg-I
of Arg-I
years Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
planet Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
we Arg-I
destroy Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitat Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
forests Arg-I
, Arg-I
jungles Arg-I
and Arg-I
lakes Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
our Arg-I
industry Arg-I
and Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
rob Arg-I
the Arg-I
ecosystem Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
every Arg-B
day Arg-I
a Arg-I
massive Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Rainforest Arg-I
in Arg-I
South Arg-I
America Arg-I
is Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
wood Arg-I
and Arg-I
farmland Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
this Arg-I
important Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
ecosystem Arg-I
many Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
will Arg-I
loose Arg-I
their Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitat Arg-I
and Arg-I
go Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
further Arg-B
generations Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
these Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a Arg-B
stable Arg-I
and Arg-I
sustainable Arg-I
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
weather Arg-I
. O

Our Arg-B
behavior Arg-I
causes Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
heavily Arg-I
affects Arg-I
the Arg-I
weather Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
on Arg-I
planet Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
and Arg-I
causes Arg-I
the Arg-I
undoubtedly Arg-I
Global Arg-I
Warming Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
affects Arg-I
the Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
humans Arg-I
because O
we Arg-B
are Arg-I
affected Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
sea Arg-I
level Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
climatic Arg-I
changes Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
recent Arg-B
studies Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
United Arg-I
Nations Arg-I
Organization Arg-I
have Arg-I
shown Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
till Arg-I
2050 Arg-I
the Arg-I
sea Arg-I
level Arg-I
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
over Arg-I
one Arg-I
meter Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
average Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
dramaticly Arg-I
affect Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
near Arg-I
the Arg-I
coast Arg-I
and Arg-I
change Arg-I
the Arg-I
global Arg-I
climate Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
is O
to O
say O
that O
, O
given O
the O
arguments O
above O
, O
we Arg-B
definitely Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
our Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
towards Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
the Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
animals Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
living Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
. O

Going O
to O
classes O
should O
be O
optional O
for O
the O
students O
University O
students O
have O
different O
opinion O
about O
their O
attendance O
to O
class O
. O

Some O
students O
believe O
that O
they O
should O
be O
required O
to O
attend O
classes O
while O
others O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
an O
optional O
for O
the O
students O
. O

According O
to O
my O
opinion O
, O
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
university Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
maturity Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
that O
going Arg-B
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
optional Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
going Arg-B
to Arg-I
classes Arg-I
are Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some Arg-B
lecturers Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
university Arg-I
read Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
text Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
reference Arg-I
books Arg-I
for Arg-I
that Arg-I
particular Arg-I
course Arg-I
module Arg-I
. O

Further O
, O
they Arg-B
did Arg-I
n't Arg-I
explain Arg-I
the Arg-I
contents Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
was Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Because O
the Arg-B
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
grown Arg-I
up Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
read Arg-I
and Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
text Arg-I
book Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
collect Arg-I
more Arg-I
information Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
sources Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
from Arg-B
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
read Arg-I
many Arg-I
articles Arg-I
and Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
watch Arg-I
video Arg-I
tutorials Arg-I
which Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
more Arg-I
apparently Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
some Arg-B
lecturers Arg-I
deliver Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
very Arg-I
informative Arg-I
and Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
attend Arg-I
that Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
feel Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
very Arg-I
useful Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
waste Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
mostly Arg-B
university Arg-I
has Arg-I
taken Arg-I
whole Arg-I
day Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
part Arg-I
time Arg-I
basis Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
the Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
studying Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
working Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
rather Arg-B
than Arg-I
attending Arg-I
any Arg-I
boring Arg-I
lecturers Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
participate Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
debate Arg-I
competition Arg-I
, Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
meet Arg-I
, Arg-I
Basketball Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
. O

From O
that O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
meet Arg-I
other Arg-I
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
build Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
although O
few Arg-B
brilliant Arg-I
lecturers Arg-I
deliver Arg-I
more Arg-I
informative Arg-I
lectures Arg-I
, O
some Arg-B
are Arg-I
boring Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
and Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
matured Arg-I
mentally Arg-I
and Arg-I
physically Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
to O
make O
use O
of O
time O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
choose Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
as Arg-I
optional Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
provide Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
. O

Famous O
people O
are O
bothered O
by O
the O
media O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
mass O
media O
should O
only O
focus O
on O
news O
and O
current O
affairs O
. O

Others O
believe O
that O
television O
, O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
should O
keep O
us O
entertained O
and O
therefore O
they O
should O
pay O
attention O
to O
famous O
people O
lives O
as O
well O
. O

This O
issue O
is O
a O
controversial O
one O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
a O
closer O
examination O
reveals O
that O
mass Arg-B
media Arg-I
deal Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
with Arg-I
superficial Arg-I
things Arg-I
for O
different O
reasons O
. O

One O
reason O
is O
that O
television Arg-B
and Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
famous Arg-I
peoples Arg-I
' Arg-I
lives Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
their Arg-I
audience Arg-I
or Arg-I
readership Arg-I
. O

Gutter Arg-B
press Arg-I
and Arg-I
Tabloid Arg-I
TV Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
replacing Arg-I
quality Arg-I
papers Arg-I
or Arg-I
documentaries Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
online Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
information Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
and O
therefore O
mass Arg-B
media Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
need Arg-I
any Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
informed Arg-I
people Arg-I
but Arg-I
their Arg-I
goal Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
readers Arg-I
or Arg-I
TV Arg-I
audience Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
we Arg-B
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
where Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
thing Arg-I
is Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
and Arg-I
gossip Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
unscrupulous Arg-I
paparazzi Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
follow Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
just Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
photo Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
eating Arg-I
or Arg-I
training Arg-I
. O

Newspapers Arg-B
often Arg-I
receive Arg-I
accusations Arg-I
of Arg-I
checkbook Arg-I
journalism Arg-I
; Arg-I
this Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
pay Arg-I
people Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
stories Arg-I
or Arg-I
photos Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
Reality Arg-I
TV Arg-I
, Arg-I
television Arg-I
programs Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
put Arg-I
into Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
environments Arg-I
and Arg-I
situations Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
like Arg-I
" Arg-I
Big Arg-I
Brother Arg-I
" Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
television Arg-B
, Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
and Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
pay Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
attention Arg-I
of Arg-I
peoples Arg-I
' Arg-I

Some O
people O

many O

such O
as O

for O
better O

so O
on O
. O

I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
my Arg-I
entire Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
place Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
my Arg-I
hometown Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
my Arg-I
hometown Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
good Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
love Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
in Arg-I
here Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
. O

I O
was O
born O
and O
grew O
up O
in O
here O
, O
a O
small O
town O
. O

In Arg-B
here Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
usually Arg-I
spend Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
sports Arg-I
like Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
, Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
and Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
fun Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
town Arg-I
have Arg-I
known Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
anyone Arg-I
needs Arg-I
help Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
neighbor Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

Nowhere Arg-B
else Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
me Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
like Arg-I
in Arg-I
here Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
here Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
love Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
system Arg-I
in Arg-I
here Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
have Arg-I
large Arg-I
streets Arg-I
but Arg-I
few Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, O
so O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
move Arg-I
easily Arg-I
to Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
. O

Last Arg-B
week Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
center Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
traffic Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
was Arg-I
too Arg-I
crowed Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
wait Arg-I
for Arg-I
an Arg-I
hour Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
house Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
also Arg-I
love Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
in Arg-I
here Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
gone Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
places Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
and Arg-I
stay Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
short Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
realize Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
place Arg-I
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
clean Arg-I
and Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
like Arg-I
my Arg-I
home Arg-I
town Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
were Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
so O
the Arg-B
environment Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
be Arg-I
keep Arg-I
clean Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
feel O
that O
staying Arg-B
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
place Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
moving Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

Moving Arg-B
some Arg-I
places Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
to Arg-I
you Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
but O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
place Arg-I
like Arg-I
your Arg-I
hometown Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
you Arg-I
feel Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I

Dormitory O
or O
apartment O
? O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
choosing O
an O
accommodation O
after O
completion O
of O
their O
high O
school O
, O
most O
students O
always O
get O
confused O
between O
these O
two O
options O
: O
living O
in O
an O
apartment O
, O
or O
in O
university O
dormitories O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
both Arg-B
choices Arg-I
have Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
helps Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
familiarize Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
extracurricular Arg-I
activities Arg-I
happing Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
attending Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
club Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
joining Arg-I
sports Arg-I
club Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
help Arg-I
when Arg-I
facing Arg-I
problem Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
if Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
solving Arg-I
their Arg-I
math Arg-I
question Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
ask Arg-I
for Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
, Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
living Arg-B
off Arg-I
campus Arg-I
prepares Arg-I
students Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
many Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
, Arg-I
independent Arg-I
, Arg-I
punctual Arg-I
, Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operative Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
university Arg-I
dormitories Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
everything Arg-I
including Arg-I
paying Arg-I
their Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
rent Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
dealing Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
utility Arg-I
bills Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
students Arg-B
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
their Arg-I
grades Arg-I
higher Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students Arg-B
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
around Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Interacting Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
socializing Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
prepares Arg-I
students Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
after Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
. O

From O
given O
the O
evidences O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it O
becomes O
hard O
for O
students O
to O
choose O
between O
their O
living O
options O
since O
both Arg-B
living Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
have Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

If O
I O
have O
to O
choose O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
choose Arg-I
the Arg-I
second Arg-I
option Arg-I
: Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
that O
it Arg-B
teaches Arg-I
me Arg-I
everything Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
because O
learning Arg-B
all Arg-I
those Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
would Arg-I
really Arg-I
help Arg-I
me Arg-I
in Arg-I
leading Arg-I
successful Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
for O
university O
students O
to O
attend O
classes O

Though O
out O
the O
last O
decade O
, O
the O
load O
of O
the O
university O
students O
has O
been O
constantly O
increasing O
. O

There O
are O
those O
who O
consider O
that O
university O
students O
can O
not O
attend O
any O
classes O
until O
the O
students O
pass O
the O
exam O
. O

There O
are O
those O
who O
said O
that O
student O
can O
attend O
the O
university O
coarse O
without O
passing O
the O
exam O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
university Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
without Arg-I
the Arg-I
prerequisite Arg-I
of Arg-I
passing Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

The O
reasons O
to O
be O
illustrated O
are O
follows O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
expert Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
subject Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
love O
Physics O
. O

But O
I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
like Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
, O
because O
electronics Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
0 Arg-I
in Arg-I
physics Arg-I
score Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
study Arg-I
the Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
I Arg-I
constantly Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
100 Arg-I
score Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
study Arg-I
other Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
physics Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
attend Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
until Arg-I
I Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
of Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
physics Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
fail Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
over Arg-I
and Arg-I
over Arg-I
again Arg-I
. O

Luckily Arg-B
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
attend Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
score Arg-I
you Arg-I
reach Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
study Arg-I
physics Arg-I
without Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
at Arg-I
last Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
took Arg-I
the Arg-I
electronics Arg-I
again Arg-I
and Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
policy Arg-I
that Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
attend Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
without Arg-I
passing Arg-I
exam Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
highly Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
uncultivated Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
one Arg-I
fail Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
. O

Then O
he Arg-B
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
will Arg-I
play Arg-I
online Arg-I
games Arg-I
days Arg-I
and Arg-I
nights Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
academic Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
will Arg-I
decline Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
this Arg-B
student Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
loser Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
all Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
permit Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
failure Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
university Arg-I
student Arg-I
may Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
reach Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
allow Arg-I
student Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
whether Arg-I
they Arg-I
pass Arg-I
the Arg-I
test Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

But O
the Arg-B
benefit Arg-I
of Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
classes Arg-I
eclipse Arg-I
the Arg-I
issue Arg-I
of Arg-I
lower Arg-I
points Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
university Arg-I
should Arg-I
allow Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
classed Arg-I
without Arg-I
passing Arg-I
the Arg-I
test Arg-I
because O
not Arg-B
only Arg-I
is Arg-I
every Arg-I
students Arg-I
expert Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
one Arg-I
subject Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
campus Arg-I
who Arg-I
leave Arg-I
uncultivated Arg-I
. O

I O
'm O
against O
providing O
more O
money O
to O
professors O
University O
education O
is O
always O
an O
important O
part O
of O
one O
's O
life O
. O

That O
's O
why O
education O
in O
university O
is O
discussed O
all O
the O
time O
. O

What O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
orientate O
the O
students O
? O

Raising O
the O
salaries O
of O
professors O
so O
? O

I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

The Arg-B
professors Arg-I
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
, O
however O
, O
the Arg-B
schools Arg-I
are Arg-I
established Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Money Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
on Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
or Arg-I
update Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
school Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
just Arg-I
instructors Arg-I
. O

The O
following O
are O
my O
opinions O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
the Arg-B
school Arg-I
should Arg-I
put Arg-I
more Arg-I
emphasis Arg-I
on Arg-I
students Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
professors Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
guide Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
actively Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
renewing Arg-I
some Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
so Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
doing Arg-I
assignment Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
comfortable Arg-I
environment Arg-I
can Arg-I
attract Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
longer Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
students Arg-B
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
circulation Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
students Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
environment Arg-I
to Arg-I
working Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
so O
the Arg-B
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
assignments Arg-I
will Arg-I
improve Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
competition Arg-I
between Arg-I
peers Arg-I
enhances Arg-I
and Arg-I
forms Arg-I
a Arg-I
circulation Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
my Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
classrooms Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
university Arg-I
are Arg-I
old Arg-I
and Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
shabby Arg-I
. O

For O
me O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
spending Arg-I
money Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
coffee Arg-I
shop Arg-I
to Arg-I
staying Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
my Arg-I
assignment Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
coffee Arg-B
shops Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
always Arg-I
quiet Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
my Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
often Arg-I
finish Arg-I
our Arg-I
work Arg-I
roughly Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
the Arg-B
ultimate Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I

students Arg-I

be Arg-I
better Arg-I

To Arg-B
improve Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
spending Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
raise Arg-I
professors Arg-I
' Arg-I
salary Arg-I
is Arg-I
inappropriate Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
will O
the O
university O
filter O
all O
the O
professors O
overall O
? O

Some O
professors O
do O
n't O
deserve O
the O
money O
at O
all O
, O
then O
, O
what O
's O
the O
point O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
them O
? O

High Arg-B
- Arg-I
salary Arg-I
instructors Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
harder Arg-I
because Arg-I
they Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
be Arg-I
any Arg-I
effect Arg-I
if Arg-I
school Arg-I
does Arg-I
so Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
was Arg-I
news Arg-I
about Arg-I
raising Arg-I
professors Arg-I
' Arg-I
salary Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
event Arg-I
provoked Arg-I
a Arg-I
demonstration Arg-I
composing Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
proposal Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
demonstration Arg-I
was Arg-I
eliminating Arg-I
the Arg-I
raising Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
policy Arg-I
of Arg-I
raising Arg-I
salary Arg-I
was Arg-I
supported Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
demonstration Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
happen Arg-I
. O

At O
school O
, O
students O
are O
priority O
. O

Students Arg-B
' Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
professors Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
at Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
the O
main O
reason O
I Arg-B
against Arg-I
providing Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
professors Arg-I
. O

Students O
are O
those O
who O
suppose O
to O
enjoy O
the O
use O
of O
their O
tuition O
. O

Our O
useful O
friends O
Pets O
have O
always O
been O
essential O
in O
our O
society O
. O

Cats O
and O
dogs O
are O
the O
most O
common O
pets O
but O
there O
are O
birds O
, O
tortoises O
and O
fishes O
as O
well O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
pets O
should O
be O
treated O
like O
family O
members O
. O

However O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
they O
are O
just O
animals O
and O
are O
n't O
able O
to O
think O
like O
us O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
controversial O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
pets Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
treated Arg-I
like Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
for O
different O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
pets Arg-B
are Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
certain Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
are Arg-I
. O

Similarly Arg-B
to Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
with Arg-I
us Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
there Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
feel Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
us Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
ever Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
point O
, O
I O
can O
write O
about O
my O
own O
experience O
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
14 Arg-I
years Arg-I
old Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
uncle Arg-I
passed Arg-I
away Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
felt Arg-I
like Arg-I
everything Arg-I
was Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Talking Arg-B
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
was Arg-I
frustrating Arg-I
because O
none Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
have Arg-I
ever Arg-I
felt Arg-I
that Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Since O
I Arg-B
was Arg-I
all Arg-I
alone Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
, O
my Arg-B
dog Arg-I
was Arg-I
near Arg-I
me Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
seemed Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
only Arg-I
him Arg-I
could Arg-I
understand Arg-I
my Arg-I
deeply Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
. O

Clearly O
, O
although O
pets Arg-B
are Arg-I
n't Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
speak Arg-I
with Arg-I
us Arg-I
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
nonetheless Arg-I
count Arg-I
on Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
pets Arg-B
are Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
the Arg-I
pet Arg-I
therapy Arg-I
is Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
more Arg-I
popular Arg-I
than Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

Researchers Arg-B
have Arg-I
discovered Arg-I
that Arg-I
pets Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
who Arg-I
lead Arg-I
blind Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
and O
therefore O
without Arg-B
them Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
go Arg-I
around Arg-I
all Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
pets Arg-B
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
depressed Arg-I
people Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
because O
their Arg-B
presence Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
feel Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
dogs Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
educated Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
out Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
smell Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
am O
strongly O
convinced O
that O
pets Arg-B
deserve Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
treated Arg-I
like Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
because O
of O
all O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
, O

namely O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
useful Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
situations Arg-I
. O

Extraordinarily O
cautious O
is O
important O
since O
rough O
work O
is O
intolerable O

This O
current O
world O
we O
situate O
ourselves O
in O
is O
rather O
unpredictable O
, O
even O
one O
sudden O
invention O
could O
bring O
down O
all O
the O
notions O
we O
used O
bear O
in O
mind O
. O

Most O
of O
us O
has O
endeavored O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
pace O
of O
the O
development O
of O
today O
's O
world O
in O
fast O
pace O
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
even O
when O
fast Arg-B
pace Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
wise Arg-I
move Arg-I
to Arg-I
correspond Arg-I
with Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
move Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Primarily O
, O
even Arg-B
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
operates Arg-I
in Arg-I
fast Arg-I
pace Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
still Arg-I
requires Arg-I
accuracy Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
simple Arg-I
issues Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
like Arg-I
homework Arg-I
require Arg-I
accuracy Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
rush Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
by Arg-I
taking Arg-I
risk Arg-I
of Arg-I
making Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
actually Arg-I
making Arg-I
zero Arg-I
effort Arg-I
going Arg-I
through Arg-I
our Arg-I
study Arg-I
roughly Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
fill Arg-I
in Arg-I
before Arg-I
the Arg-I
deadline Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
it Arg-B
only Arg-I
fulfills Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
itself Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
rather Arg-I
worthless Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
our Arg-I
capability Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
should Arg-I
improve Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
holding Arg-I
the Arg-I
belief Arg-I
in Arg-I
completing Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Certainly O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
take Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
if Arg-I
w Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
review Arg-I
our Arg-I
work Arg-I
multiple Arg-I
times Arg-I
, O
but O
with Arg-B
consistent Arg-I
work Arg-I
soon Arg-I
enough Arg-I
we Arg-I
'll Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
bring Arg-I
up Arg-I
our Arg-I
speed Arg-I
in Arg-I
completion Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
other Arg-B
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
accuracy Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
also Arg-I
seeks Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
concludes Arg-I
both Arg-I
minimum Arg-I
time Arg-I
completion Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
criterion Arg-I
of Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
managed Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
by Arg-I
neglecting Arg-I
the Arg-I
details Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
and Arg-I
only Arg-I
aim Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
general Arg-I
frame Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
something Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
and Arg-I
clients Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
soon Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
picture Arg-I
even Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
kept Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
since O
when Arg-B
the Arg-I
problem Arg-I
reveals Arg-I
itself Arg-I
we Arg-I
'll Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
back Arg-I
and Arg-I
fix Arg-I
the Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
made Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
costly Arg-I
and Arg-I
time Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
than Arg-I
a Arg-I
neat Arg-I
completion Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
start Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
when O
looking O
at O
this O
problem O
within O
a O
broader O
image O
. O

Some Arg-B
work Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
tolerate Arg-I
any Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
at Arg-I
all Arg-I
, O
for O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
official Arg-I
missions Arg-I
like Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
NASA Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
tiny Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
catastrophic Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
miscalculation Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
orbit Arg-I
in Arg-I
launching Arg-I
rocket Arg-I
may Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
failure Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
project Arg-I
which Arg-I
might Arg-I
worth Arg-I
trillions Arg-I
of Arg-I
dollars Arg-I
. O

In O
such O
circumstances O
, O
even Arg-B
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
off Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
n't Arg-I
miss Arg-I
even Arg-I
a Arg-I
single Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
mission Arg-I
since Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
trigger Arg-I
loads Arg-I
of Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
even O
when O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
catch Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
pace Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
extraordinarily Arg-I
cautious Arg-I
since O
rough Arg-B
work Arg-I
is Arg-I
intolerable Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
stay Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
. O

Living O
in O
big O
cities O
or O
living O
in O
small O
towns O
Continuous O
technological O
and O
economical O
development O
in O
modern O
world O
created O
great O
differences O
between O
cities O
, O
a O
difference O
that O
is O
clearly O
visible O
in O
the O
size O
of O
various O
cities O
. O

From O
cities O
with O
more O
that O
20 O
million O
people O
to O
small O
towns O
inhabited O
by O
only O
hundreds O
of O
people O
. O

This O
diversities O
in O
cities O
allowed O
for O
more O
difference O
in O
people O
's O
preferences O
for O
where O
to O
live O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
cities Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
small Arg-I
ones Arg-I
, O
this O
personal O
attitude O
is O
the O
result O
of O
many O
factors O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
find O
the O
excitement O
of O
big O
cities O
to O
be O
attractive O
, O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dynamic Arg-I
environment Arg-I
can Arg-I
turn Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
rich Arg-I
experience Arg-I
that Arg-I
sharpens Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
personality Arg-I
and Arg-I
open Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Life Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
cities Arg-I
gives Arg-I
one Arg-I
new Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
let Arg-I
it Arg-I
be Arg-I
deciding Arg-I
which Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
or Arg-I
deciding Arg-I
which Arg-I
company Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
considered Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
constant Arg-I
, Arg-I
slow Arg-I
paced Arg-I
life Arg-I
styles Arg-I
of Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
put O
big O
cities O
in O
front O
of O
small O
towns O
is O
the Arg-B
facilitates Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
it Arg-I
contains Arg-I
which Arg-I
support Arg-I
and Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
inhabitants Arg-I
' Arg-I
lives Arg-I
, Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
, Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
medical Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
can Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
need Arg-I
of Arg-I
medical Arg-I
safety Arg-I
. O

Cultural Arg-B
events Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
exhibitions Arg-I
and Arg-I
theatre Arg-I
plays Arg-I
can Arg-I
enrich Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
and Arg-I
widen Arg-I
his Arg-I
horizons Arg-I
, Arg-I
things Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
n't Arg-I
offered Arg-I
by Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
's O
undeniable O
that O
the O
economic Arg-B
power Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I
is Arg-I
driven Arg-I
by Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
and Arg-I
finance Arg-I
is Arg-I
centered Arg-I
and Arg-I
controlled Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

With O
this O
kind O
of O
power O
big Arg-B
cities Arg-I
offer Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
career Arg-I
advancements Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
of Arg-I
higher Arg-I
income Arg-I
that Arg-I
small Arg-I
towns Arg-I
does Arg-I
, O
and O
higher Arg-B
income Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
basis Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
happier Arg-I
, Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
although O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
but O
assure O
that O
this O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
personal O
taste O
, O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
love Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
some Arg-I
days Arg-I
in Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
to Arg-I
recharge Arg-I
my Arg-I
soul Arg-I
and Arg-I
relieve Arg-I
myself Arg-I
from Arg-I
daily Arg-I
stress Arg-I
. O

Every O
experience O
always O
gives O
us O
something O
to O
learn O
and O
keep O
for O
life O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
our O
life O
seems O
tough O
at O
the O
time O
but O
those O
difficult O
experiences O
of O
life O
become O
important O
lessons O
for O
the O
future O
. O

My O
opinion O
based O
on O
the O
reasons O
that O
Every O
tough O
experience Arg-B
makes Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
skilled Arg-I
, Arg-I
improves Arg-I
our Arg-I
decision Arg-I
making Arg-I
and Arg-I
makes Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
compatible Arg-I
for Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

The O
best O
example O
of O
it O
is O
how O
babies O
learn O
about O
basics O
survival O
habits O
during O
their O
childhood O
. O

Every Arg-B
day Arg-I
comes Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
like Arg-I
walking Arg-I
, O
eating O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
but O
those Arg-B
challenges Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
initial Arg-I
life Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
important Arg-I
survival Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
walking Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
stumble Arg-I
and Arg-I
hurt Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
many Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

But O
they Arg-B
slowly Arg-I
tune Arg-I
their Arg-I
technique Arg-I
and Arg-I
learned Arg-I
to Arg-I
walk Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
inventions Arg-I
and Arg-I
experiments Arg-I
are Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
many Arg-I
unfortunate Arg-I
observations Arg-I
. O

No Arg-B
known Arg-I
scientist Arg-I
has Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
first Arg-I
attempt Arg-I
. O

Scientists Arg-B
try Arg-I
and Arg-I
test Arg-I
many Arg-I
specimens Arg-I
before Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
Thomas Arg-B
Edison Arg-I
tested Arg-I
around Arg-I
10000 Arg-I
bulbs Arg-I
before Arg-I
inventing Arg-I
Light Arg-I
bulb Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
all Arg-B
the Arg-I
initial Arg-I
experiments Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
and Arg-I
frustrating Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
but Arg-I
he Arg-I
searched Arg-I
for Arg-I
more Arg-I
options Arg-I
and Arg-I
learnt Arg-I
new Arg-I
findings Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
experiment Arg-I
even Arg-I
when Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
failing Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
attempts Arg-I
and Arg-I
finally Arg-I
found Arg-I
break Arg-I
through Arg-I
. O

Our Arg-B
difficult Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
us Arg-I
robust Arg-I
and Arg-I
strong Arg-I
unknowingly Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
facing Arg-I
a Arg-I
toughest Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
think Arg-I
back Arg-I
about Arg-I
those Arg-I
moments Arg-I
later Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
confident Arg-I
about Arg-I
our Arg-I
decisions Arg-I
and Arg-I
about Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
moved Arg-I
to Arg-I
college Arg-I
hostel Arg-I
after Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
first Arg-I
few Arg-I
days Arg-I
were Arg-I
very Arg-I
unsettling Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
because O
first Arg-B
time Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
parent Arg-I
and Arg-I
staying Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
not Arg-I
known Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
had Arg-I
felt Arg-I
very Arg-I
fragile Arg-I
and Arg-I
emotionally Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
then Arg-I
slowly Arg-I
I Arg-I
started Arg-I
adjusting Arg-I
with Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
and Arg-I
built Arg-I
connection Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
also Arg-I
became Arg-I
more Arg-I
casual Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
experience Arg-I
increased Arg-I
my Arg-I
communication Arg-I
skill Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
speaking Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
to O
conclude O
my O
opinion O
on O
this O
statement O
, O
I O
want O
to O
mentioned O
that O
every Arg-B
experience Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
whether Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
or Arg-I
bad Arg-I
always Arg-I
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
something Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
keep Arg-I
for Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Good Arg-B
experiences Arg-I
give Arg-I
us Arg-I
good Arg-I
memories Arg-I
and Arg-I
bad Arg-I
ones Arg-I
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
for Arg-I
life Arg-I

I O

the O
contention O
that O
no Arg-B

The O
reasons O

the O

Capitalism Arg-B
enfranchised Arg-I

Driving Arg-B

so Arg-I
, O
and O
accordingly O
, O
charging Arg-B

extra Arg-I

might Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I

. O

From O
another O
point O
of O
view O
, O
traffic Arg-B
jam Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
natural Arg-I
phenomenon Arg-I
that Arg-I
nobody Arg-I
is Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
shun Arg-I

; O
so O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I

Why O
drivers O
should O
pay O

only O

time O

Wars Arg-B

you Arg-I

Buying Arg-B

all Arg-I

- Arg-I
these Arg-I
are Arg-I
all Arg-I
ready Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
families Arg-I
to Arg-I
bear Arg-I
. O

Charging Arg-B
drivers Arg-I
one Arg-I
more Arg-I
fee Arg-I
makes Arg-I
no Arg-I
sense Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
ridiculous Arg-I
. O

Majority Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
families Arg-I
buy Arg-I
cars Arg-I
simply Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
safer Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
conveyance Arg-I
, O
and O
charging Arg-B
them Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
fee Arg-I
adds Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
burden Arg-I
and Arg-I
is Arg-I
actually Arg-I
jeopardizing Arg-I
their Arg-I
rights Arg-I
. O

Rather Arg-B
than Arg-I
passively Arg-I
forcing Arg-I
drivers Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
another Arg-I
fee Arg-I
, Arg-I
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
instead Arg-I
, Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
active Arg-I
on Arg-I
advocating Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
energy Arg-I
or Arg-I
planning Arg-I
out Arg-I
more Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
and Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
layout Arg-I
that Arg-I
allow Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
their Arg-I
destinations Arg-I
with Arg-I
less Arg-I
oil Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
occur Arg-I
only Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
malfunction Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
light Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
unreasonable Arg-I
organization Arg-I
of Arg-I

. O

In O
these O
cases O
, O
the Arg-B
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
charged Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
fine Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
planner Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
drivers Arg-I
. O

Simply O
put O
, O
charging Arg-B
drivers Arg-I
fees Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
causes Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
problems Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
ridiculous Arg-I
and Arg-I
even Arg-I
unlawful Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
" Arg-B
rush Arg-I
hours Arg-I
" Arg-I
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
direct Arg-I
consequence Arg-I
of Arg-I
drivers Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
real O
causes O
of O
traffic O
jam O
may O
fall O
on O
various O
of O
grounds O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
charging Arg-B
drivers Arg-I
for Arg-I
another Arg-I
fee Arg-I
for Arg-I
this Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
unreasonable Arg-I
and Arg-I
irrational Arg-I
. O

The O
part O
- O
time O
job O
can O
let O
students O
experience O
the O
real O
adult O
life O
and O
know O
more O
about O
it O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
difference O
between O
school O
and O
society O
is O
bigger O
and O
bigger O
. O

If O
students O
want O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
society O
quickly O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
for Arg-I
parents Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
some O
reasons O
can O
support O
my O
view O
. O

First O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
. O

Because O
most Arg-B
people Arg-I
they Arg-I
contact Arg-I
with Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
when Arg-B
students Arg-I
do Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
whom Arg-I
are Arg-I
adults Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
about Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
friend Arg-I
Lisa Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
doing Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
now Arg-I
, Arg-I
tells Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
fabulous Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
she Arg-I
makes Arg-I
friends Arg-I
with Arg-I
different Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
let Arg-I
her Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Lisa Arg-B
thought Arg-I
in Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
work Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
core Arg-I
; Arg-I
but Arg-I
after Arg-I
she Arg-I
knows Arg-I
these Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
she Arg-I
changes Arg-I
her Arg-I
mind Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
true Arg-I
core Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
but Arg-I
not Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
her Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
has Arg-I
provided Arg-I
; Arg-I
now Arg-I
she Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
about Arg-I
her Arg-I
future Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
parents Arg-B
always Arg-I
tell Arg-I
students Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
tenser Arg-I
than Arg-I
school Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
because O
we Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
experience Arg-I
it Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
really Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
tense Arg-I
the Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
hard Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

Actually O
, O
some Arg-B
questionnaires Arg-I
indicate Arg-I
that Arg-I
if Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
taken Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
importantly Arg-I
; Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
expect Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
than Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
not Arg-I
taken Arg-I
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
understand Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
some O
parents O
are O
afraid O
that O
the Arg-B
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
will Arg-I
effect Arg-I
student Arg-I
' Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Actually O
, O
most Arg-B
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
holiday Arg-I
, O
so O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Compared Arg-B
with Arg-I
playing Arg-I
computers Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
, Arg-I
doing Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
their Arg-I
holiday Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
taking Arg-B
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
can Arg-I
let Arg-I
students Arg-I
experience Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
know Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
parents Arg-B
should Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

we O

either O

As O

I O

Being Arg-B
by Arg-I
nature Arg-I
introvert Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
on Arg-I
adjusting Arg-I
to Arg-I
surroundings Arg-I
and Arg-I
especially Arg-I
new Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Once Arg-B
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
working Arg-I
on Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
with Arg-I
strangers Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
sat Arg-I
aside Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
half Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
myself Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
making Arg-I
attempts Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
acquainted Arg-I
with Arg-I
unknown Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
my Arg-B
productivity Arg-I
boosts Arg-I
when Arg-I
style Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
is Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
temper Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
/ O
moreover O
, O
working Arg-B
alone Arg-I
allows Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
spending Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
on Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
an Arg-I
integral Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I Arg-B
must Arg-I
not Arg-I
divide Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
and Arg-I
duties Arg-I
between Arg-I
team Arg-I
members Arg-I
, Arg-I
share Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
and Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
teambuilding Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
are Arg-I
especially Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
situations Arg-I
of Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

About Arg-B
a Arg-I
year Arg-I
ago Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
lucky Arg-I
to Arg-I

a Arg-I

of Arg-I

To Arg-B
my Arg-I

' Arg-I
surprise Arg-I

being Arg-I

a Arg-I
victory Arg-I

In O
conclusion O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
type Arg-B
of Arg-I
temper Arg-I
and Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
individual Arg-I
work Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
persuasive Arg-I
arguments Arg-I
in Arg-I
favor Arg-I
of Arg-I
studying Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

Work O
for O
themselves O
vs O
work O
for O
employer O

Most O
people O
want O
to O
work O
for O
an O
employer O
, O
because O
they O
want O
to O
feel O
secure O
about O
their O
salary O
, O
or O
feel O
comfortable O
about O
other O
problems O
of O
having O
own O
job O
such O
as O
paying O
tax O
, O
worrying O
about O
selling O
, O
etc O
. O

Despite O
these O
problems O
, O
personally O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

My O
arguments O
are O
listed O
as O
follows O
. O

First O
, O
time Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
thing Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
having Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
manage Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

I O
could Arg-B
work Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
boss Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
delay Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
arrange Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
long Arg-I
hours Arg-I
for Arg-I
earning Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Totally O
, O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
employed Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
free Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
earning Arg-B
money Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
reason Arg-I
that Arg-I
why Arg-I
people Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
criterion Arg-I
for Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
I Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
my Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
to Arg-I
employers Arg-I
cheaply Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I Arg-B
never Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
rich Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
because O
my Arg-B
salary Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
changed Arg-I
. O

In O
spite O
of O
many O
problems O
of O
having O
own O
business O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
eager Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
run Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
business Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
my Arg-I
own Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
noble Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

Parents O
are O
our O
teachers O
from O
the O
very O
early O
time O
in O
our O
life O

Learning O
is O
a O
thing O
that O
we O
do O
in O
all O
of O
our O
lives O
. O

Getting O
the O
best O
lessons O
, O
besides O
our O
abilities O
to O
self O
- O
study O
, O
depends O
on O
our O
teachers O
a O
lot O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
no Arg-B
one Arg-I
else Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
our Arg-I
parents Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

I O
whole O
- O
heartedly O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion O
because O
of O
these O
following O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
our Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
very Arg-I
early Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
we Arg-I
were Arg-I
born Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
taught Arg-I
us Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
very Arg-I
little Arg-I
things Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
smile Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
walk Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
routines Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
eating Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
when Arg-B
we Arg-I
grow Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
many Arg-I
fairy Arg-I
tales Arg-I
and Arg-I
several Arg-I
important Arg-I
ethic Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
that Arg-I
affect Arg-I
us Arg-I
till Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
at Arg-B
school Arg-I
we Arg-I
study Arg-I
bigger Arg-I
things Arg-I
about Arg-I
sciences Arg-I
and Arg-I
languages Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
after Arg-I
school Arg-I
we Arg-I
learn Arg-I
from Arg-I
our Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we Arg-B
spend Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
time Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
families Arg-I
than Arg-I
it Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
when Arg-B
we Arg-I
leave Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
maybe Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
forget Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
we Arg-I
learn Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
experience Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
but O
I O
strongly O
believe O
we Arg-B
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
forget Arg-I
what Arg-I
our Arg-I
parents Arg-I
have Arg-I
taught Arg-I
us Arg-I
because O
we Arg-B
use Arg-I
it Arg-I
every Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
believe Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
forget Arg-I
what Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
told Arg-I
me Arg-I
about Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
grateful Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
help Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
I O
totally O
believe O
parents Arg-B
love Arg-I
their Arg-I
sons Arg-I
or Arg-I
daughters Arg-I
unconditionally Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
even Arg-B
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
grow Arg-I
older Arg-I
, Arg-I
get Arg-I
married Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
have Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
families Arg-I
with Arg-I
spouses Arg-I
and Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
always Arg-I
keep Arg-I
watching Arg-I
us Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
realize Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
right Arg-I
and Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
my Arg-B
older Arg-I
brother Arg-I
has Arg-I
got Arg-I
married Arg-I
and Arg-I
lived Arg-I
independently Arg-I
for Arg-I
two Arg-I
years Arg-I
but Arg-I
when Arg-I
he Arg-I
faces Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
his Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
comes Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
our Arg-I
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
ask Arg-I
for Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
our Arg-I
best Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Different O
types O
of O
tasks O
endow O
more O
colors O
to O
our O
life O

In O
my O
family O
, O
the O
argument O
topic O
between O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
always O
involves O
my O
father O
's O
job O
. O

Five O
years O
ago O
, O
he O
quitted O
his O
20 O
years O
job O
as O
an O
architectural O
engineer O
, O
and O
became O
a O
landscape O
painter O
. O

Every O
time O
I O
asked O
him O
why O
, O
he O
will O
say O
, O
seriously O
, O
" O
I O
am O
done O
, O
doing O
this O
same O
work O
for O
20 O
years O
and O
I O
really O
want O
to O
try O
some O
different O
, O
that O
is O
all O
. O

" O

While O
there O
are O
innumerous O
people O
will O
deem O
it O
ridiculous O
and O
argue O
doing O
the O
same O
task O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
job O
, O
but O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
I O
am O
on O
the O
side O
of O
my O
father O
. O

Most O
of O
workers O
have O
adapted O
to O
do O
same O
task O
. O

It Arg-B
allows Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
a Arg-I
authoritative Arg-I
dentist Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
province Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
mother Arg-I
has Arg-I
worked Arg-I
for Arg-I
25 Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Gandhi Arg-B
devoted Arg-I
his Arg-I
whole Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
fight Arg-I
against Arg-I
British Arg-I
- Arg-I
ruled Arg-I
government Arg-I
and Arg-I
inspire Arg-I
movements Arg-I
for Arg-I
civil Arg-I
rights Arg-I
in Arg-I
India Arg-I
, Arg-I
finally Arg-I
he Arg-I
became Arg-I
the Arg-I
father Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

These O
examples O
make O
it O
obvious O
that O
great Arg-B
achievement Arg-I
needs Arg-I
someone Arg-I
keen Arg-I
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
task Arg-I
for Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

While O
when Arg-B
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
" Arg-I
happier Arg-I
" Arg-I
, Arg-I
different Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
factor Arg-I
. O

Doing Arg-B
different Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
makes Arg-I
employees Arg-I
and Arg-I
employers Arg-I
much Arg-I
happier Arg-I
. O

Workers Arg-B
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
for Arg-I
an Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
company Arg-I
or Arg-I
industry Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
sick Arg-I
of Arg-I
same Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
day Arg-I
by Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

Although O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
, O
changing Arg-B
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
what Arg-I
serve Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
happier Arg-I
. O

Changing Arg-B
the Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
and Arg-I
elicit Arg-I
their Arg-I
potential Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
, Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
psychology Arg-I
theories Arg-I
, Arg-I
makes Arg-I
workers Arg-I
relaxed Arg-I
and Arg-I
happier Arg-I
. O

To O
set O
another O
example O
, O
consider Arg-B
every Arg-I
workers Arg-I
have Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
several Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
employers Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
generating Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
both Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
change Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
task Arg-I
day Arg-I
by Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

Different Arg-B
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
during Arg-I
workday Arg-I
brings Arg-I
more Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
life Arg-I
colorful Arg-I
. O

Just Arg-B
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
song Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
, Arg-I
life Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
blue Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
an Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
researcher Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
surely Arg-I
be Arg-I
disappointed Arg-I
for Arg-I
failure Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
exited Arg-I
for Arg-I
new Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
. O

New Arg-B
challenges Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
amounts Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
more Arg-I
works Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
also Arg-I
means Arg-I
through Arg-I
dealing Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
more Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
the Arg-I
saying Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
writer Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
color Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
rooted Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
Japanese Arg-I
cherry Arg-I
blossom Arg-I
or Arg-I
Canadian Arg-I
maple Arg-I
leaf Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
rather Arg-I
there Arg-I
always Arg-I
exists Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
doing Arg-B
same Arg-I
task Arg-I
day Arg-I
and Arg-I
night Arg-I
just Arg-I
server Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
our Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
burden Arg-I
, Arg-I
connecting Arg-I
with Arg-I
different Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
capable Arg-I
give Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
colors Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
admire O
my O
father O
's O
choice O
, O
while O
the Arg-B
same Arg-I
task Arg-I
give Arg-I
us Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
expert Arg-I
, O
like O
my O
mom O
, O
I O
still O
hold O
the O
firm O
view O
that O
different Arg-B
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
endow Arg-I
more Arg-I
colors Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Excellent O
knowledge O
is O
better O
than O
ability O
to O
adopt O
oneself O
With O
the O
rapid O
development O
of O
economy O
, O
the O
controversial O
of O
good O
worker O
's O
requirement O
is O
always O
in O
a O
limelight O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
people O
will O
say O
the O
ability O
to O
adapt O
oneself O
to O
a O
new O
environment O
is O
necessary O
, O
because O
it O
is O
the O
basic O
communication O
skill O
for O
a O
new O
worker O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
thing Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
company Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
an Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
worker Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
possessing Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
job Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
significant Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
oneself Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
proven Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
ability Arg-I
is Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
in Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
workmates Arg-I
, Arg-I
cooperating Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
workers Arg-I
needs Arg-I
this Arg-I
ability Arg-I
, Arg-I
too Arg-I
. O

But O
working Arg-B
alone Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
longer Arg-I
- Arg-I
term Arg-I
job Arg-I
than Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
, O
that O
is O
, O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
adapting Arg-I
oneself Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
worker Arg-I
, O
but O
the Arg-B
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
job Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
till Arg-I
one Arg-I
leave Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
company Arg-I
will Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
every Arg-I
worker Arg-I
of Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
core Arg-I
and Arg-I
most Arg-I
profitable Arg-I
technology Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
IT Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
invented Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
worker Arg-I
with Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
computer Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
worker Arg-I
with Arg-I
outstanding Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
skill Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
high Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
and Arg-I
popularity Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
is Arg-I
earned Arg-I
by Arg-I
some Arg-I
brilliant Arg-I
workers Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
relation Arg-I
department Arg-I
with Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
skill Arg-I
to Arg-I
propagate Arg-I
this Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

So O
the Arg-B
company Arg-I
will Arg-I
earn Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
workers Arg-I
with Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Employees Arg-B
will Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
reward Arg-I
from Arg-I
hard Arg-I
- Arg-I
work Arg-I
pursuing Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
our Arg-I
whole Arg-I
study Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
undergraduate Arg-I
and Arg-I
graduate Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
keep Arg-I
learning Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
exerting Arg-I
these Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
just Arg-I
like Arg-I
an Arg-I
old Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
scholar Arg-I
said Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
essence Arg-I
of Arg-I
study Arg-I
is Arg-I
utilizing Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
we Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
of Arg-I
we Arg-I
keep Arg-I
accumulating Arg-I
and Arg-I
collecting Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
is Arg-I
rooted Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
fawn Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
manager Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
this Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
business Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
making Arg-I
us Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
and Arg-I
totally Arg-I
master Arg-I
this Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
we Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
with Arg-I
pride Arg-I
. O

That O
's O
why O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
reward Arg-I
from Arg-I
out Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
although O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
adapting Arg-I
oneself Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
excellent Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
of Arg-I
more Arg-I
importance Arg-I
. O

Because O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
our Arg-I
employers Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
ourselves Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
. O

People O
benefit O
more O
from O
coming O
computers O
into O
their O
lives O
Computers O
have O
revolutionized O
our O
lifestyle O
during O
last O
century O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
especially O
young O
ones O
use O
computers O
extremely O
and O
this O
excessive O
usage O
lead O
to O
increase O
stress O
among O
them O
, O
but O
computers O
have O
brought O
many O
advantages O
to O
our O
lives O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
computers Arg-B
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
and Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
economic Arg-I
, Arg-I
business Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
societies Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they Arg-B
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
easier Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
our Arg-I
routine Arg-I
duties Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
by Arg-B
using Arg-I
computers Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
industries Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
computer Arg-I
can Arg-I
control Arg-I
and Arg-I
perform Arg-I
some Arg-I
routine Arg-I
activities Arg-I
in Arg-I
industries Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
were Arg-I
early Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
human Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
industries Arg-I
use Arg-I
computers Arg-I
to Arg-I
command Arg-I
to Arg-I
robots Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
many Arg-I
regular Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
were Arg-I
carried Arg-I
out Arg-I
by Arg-I
human Arg-I
early Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
many Arg-B
processes Arg-I
of Arg-I
production Arg-I
of Arg-I
cars Arg-I
are Arg-I
carrying Arg-I
out Arg-I
by Arg-I
robots Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
controlled Arg-I
by Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
car Arg-B
companies Arg-I
use Arg-I
computers Arg-I
to Arg-I
simulate Arg-I
and Arg-I
analyze Arg-I
car Arg-I
accident Arg-I
by Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

Despite Arg-B
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
coming Arg-I
computers Arg-I
many Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
vanished Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
industries Arg-I
fire Arg-I
many Arg-I
forces Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
their Arg-I
works Arg-I
by Arg-I
new Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
and Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

Computers Arg-B
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
social Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Computers Arg-B
have Arg-I
opened Arg-I
up Arg-I
a Arg-I
network Arg-I
connection Arg-I
among Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
technology Arg-I
makes Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
send Arg-I
and Arg-I
receive Arg-I
personal Arg-I
message Arg-I
. O

Teenagers Arg-B
and Arg-I
adolescents Arg-I
spend Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
People Arg-B
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
computers Arg-I
to Arg-I
extract Arg-I
their Arg-I
essential Arg-I
information Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
excessive Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
computers Arg-I
has Arg-I
brought Arg-I
many Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
results Arg-I
show Arg-I
that Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
show Arg-I
more Arg-I
violent Arg-I
and Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
type Arg-I
by Arg-I
computers Arg-I
may Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
such Arg-I
disease Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
knees Arg-I
. O

By O
considering O
all O
reasons O
, O
advantages Arg-B
of Arg-I
computers Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
benefit Arg-I
more Arg-I
from Arg-I
coming Arg-I
computers Arg-I
into Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
computers Arg-B
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
most Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
which Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
life Arg-I
easier Arg-I
. O

Is O
it O
necessary O
for O
children O
or O
not O
? O

Learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
is O
necessary O
for O
children O
to O
strengthen O
their O
ability O
to O
learn O
. O

Whether O
children O
should O
start O
learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
as O
they O
start O
school O
or O
not O
might O
be O
a O
controversial O
issue O
. O

It Arg-B
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
should Arg-I
start Arg-I
learning Arg-I
that Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
start Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
that Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
minds Arg-I
and Arg-I
memories Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
can Arg-I
extend Arg-I
their Arg-I
visions Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
the Arg-B
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
Learning Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
period Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
periods Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Thereby O
students Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
beginning Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
education Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
easier Arg-I
in Arg-I
compare Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
young Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
language Arg-I
structure Arg-I
and Arg-I
memorize Arg-I
the Arg-I
vocabularies Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
out O
of O
of O
the O
questioned O
that O
the Arg-B
persistence Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

By O
considering O
this O
and O
being O
aware O
of O
that O
students O
have O
not O
any O
responsibility O
and O
other O
difficulty O
in O
comparison O
with O
a O
young O
man O
, O
we O
can O
infer O
that O
why O
this Arg-B
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
any Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Learning Arg-B
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
helps Arg-I
students Arg-I
tremendously Arg-I
to Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
what Arg-I
happens Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
around Arg-I
World Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
other Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
and Arg-I
costumes Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
It Arg-B
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
them Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
power Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
better Arg-I
with Arg-I
peers Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
World Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
knowledge Arg-I
about Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
languages Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
extend Arg-I
the Arg-I
child Arg-I
's Arg-I
vision Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
personalities Arg-I
and Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
reliance Arg-I
. O

Overall O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
between Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
having Arg-I
two Arg-I
languages Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
having Arg-I
just Arg-I
his Arg-I
native Arg-I
language Arg-I
while Arg-I
comparing Arg-I
their Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
, Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
other Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
, O
to O
find O
that O
why O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
start Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
beginning Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

The O

" O
The O
biggest O
risk O

not O
taking O
any O

" O

The O
ones O
who O
have O
a O
big O
dream O
, O
they O
need O
to O
be O
brave O
and O
dare O
to O
live O
new O
situations O

It O
is O
not O
guaranteed O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
achieve O
your O
dream O
if O
you O
had O
planned O
carefully O
as O
the O

way O
when O
you O
take O

but O
it O
is O
more O
frustrating O
if O
you O
had O
made O
plans O

and O
then O
it O
went O
wrong O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
chances Arg-I
and Arg-I
believe Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
out Arg-I
. O

Assuming Arg-B
new Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
is Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
life Arg-B
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
easy Arg-I
; Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
various Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
especially Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
, O
but O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
surprisingly Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
abandon Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
country Arg-I
without Arg-I
knowing Arg-I
what Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
holds Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
beginning Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
tough Arg-I
to Arg-I
fit Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
and Arg-I
find Arg-I
any Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
, O
but O
after Arg-B
fighting Arg-I
against Arg-I
the Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
blocking Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
desired Arg-I
; Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
conquer Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
craving Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
start Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
other Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
afraid Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
and Arg-I
fail Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
frustrate Arg-I
along Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
, O
but O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
vital Arg-I
to Arg-I
never Arg-I
give Arg-I
up Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
dream Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
Walt Arg-B
Disney Arg-I
, Arg-I
whose Arg-I
career Arg-I
is Arg-I
famous Arg-I
, Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
challenging Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
was Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
histories Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Mickey Arg-I
Mouse Arg-I
and Arg-I
Three Arg-I
Little Arg-I
Pigs Arg-I
, Arg-I
were Arg-I
turned Arg-I
down Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
heard Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
" Arg-I
no Arg-I
" Arg-I
, Arg-I
furthermore Arg-I
one Arg-I
editor Arg-I
fired Arg-I
him Arg-I
alleging Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
no Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
all Arg-I
what Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
gone Arg-I
through Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
never Arg-I
stop Arg-I
chasing Arg-I
his Arg-I
dreams Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
world Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
fearless Arg-I
and Arg-I
face Arg-I
all Arg-I
new Arg-I
situations Arg-I
. O

Even O
though O
sometimes Arg-B
you Arg-I
consider Arg-I
backing Arg-I
down Arg-I
and Arg-I
stay Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
routine Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
courage Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
risks Arg-I
, Arg-I
be Arg-I
different Arg-I
and Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
your Arg-I
dream Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
successful Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
personal O
live O
, O
we O
have O
some O
responsibilities O
towards O
other O
people O
People O
should O
sometimes O
do O
things O
, O
even O
though O
they O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
. O

This O
is O
basic O
part O
of O
the O
lives O
. O

There O
may O
be O
small O
or O
big O
things O
, O
but O
at O
last O
people O
should O
accept O
them O
, O
because O
most O
of O
them O
is O
about O
responsibilities O
. O

Moreover O
, O
sometimes O
by O
doing O
things O
helps O
the O
people O
learn O
about O
live O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
the O
reasons O
for O
why O
I O
agree O
that O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
do Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
doing O
will O
be O
explored O
. O

Firstly O
, O
most Arg-B
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
are Arg-I
filled Arg-I
with Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
doing Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
personal Arg-I
live Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
towards Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
nobody Arg-I
who Arg-I
likes Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
housework Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
although Arg-I
my Arg-I
husband Arg-I
helps Arg-I
me Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
my Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
really Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
like Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
however Arg-I
I Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
professional Arg-B
lives Arg-I
are Arg-I
filled Arg-I
with Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
neccessary Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

Nobody Arg-B
likes Arg-I
attending Arg-I
boring Arg-I
conferences Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
working Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
well Arg-I
in Arg-I
with Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
'm Arg-I
a Arg-I
research Arg-I
asistant Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
univesity Arg-I
in Arg-I
ours Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
professor Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
n't Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
human Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
asistans Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
with Arg-I
him Arg-I
about Arg-I
any Arg-I
situation Arg-I
, Arg-I
although Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
about Arg-I
his Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
doing Arg-B
something Arg-I
which Arg-I
an Arg-I
individual Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
can Arg-I
led Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoyment Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
sometimes Arg-I
can Arg-I
attend Arg-I
any Arg-I
activities Arg-I
by Arg-I
insisting Arg-I
on Arg-I
any Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
although Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
really Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
one Arg-B
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
tell Arg-I
my Arg-I
husband Arg-I
and Arg-I
me Arg-I
about Arg-I
a Arg-I
dance Arg-I
course Arg-I
which Arg-I
we Arg-I
both Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
insisting Arg-I
on Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
attended Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
got Arg-I
really Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
continued Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
about Arg-I
six Arg-I
months Arg-I
although Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
friends Arg-I
left Arg-I
the Arg-I
course Arg-I
after Arg-I
a Arg-I
month Arg-I
. O

Nobody O
has O
a O
life O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
; O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
and Arg-I
boring Arg-I
parts Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
liked Arg-I
by Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
about Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
individual Arg-I
's Arg-I
live Arg-I
. O

Young O
adults O
preference O
on O
how O
long O
they O
should O
live O
with O
their O
parents O
before O
moving O
out O
As O
young O
people O
gets O
older O
they O
tend O
to O
seek O
more O
freedom O
and O
want O
to O
live O
on O
their O
own O
. O

But O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
what O
is O
the O
right O
age O
for O
young O
adults O
to O
leave O
their O
parents O
and O
start O
living O
on O
their O
own O
is O
a O
contentious O
one O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
young Arg-B
adults Arg-I
should Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
longer Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
huge Arg-I
financial Arg-I
commitment Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
younger Arg-I
age Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
paying Arg-I
job Arg-I
, O
so O
It Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
task Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
rent Arg-I
, Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
utilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
to Arg-I
sustain Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living Arg-B
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
wise Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
adults Arg-I
until Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
head Arg-I
start Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
professional Arg-I
career Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
longer Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
enhanced Arg-I
emotional Arg-I
attachment Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Parents Arg-B
have Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
advice Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
go Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
changes Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
together Arg-I
develops Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
discussing Arg-I
adult Arg-I
's Arg-I
physiological Arg-I
and Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
changes Arg-I
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Young Arg-B
adults Arg-I
will Arg-I
feel Arg-I
reluctant Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
such Arg-I
problems Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
move Arg-I
out Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
thus Arg-I
missing Arg-I
the Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
input Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

While O
some O
critics O
may O
argue O
that O
, O
young Arg-B
adults Arg-I
living Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
most Arg-B
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
are Arg-I
inclined Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
unprecedented Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
thing Arg-I
if Arg-I
living Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
party Arg-I
all Arg-I
night Arg-I
, Arg-I
smoke Arg-I
or Arg-I
do Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
young Arg-B
adults Arg-I
should Arg-I
only Arg-I
consider Arg-I
living Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
only Arg-I
after Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
sure Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
sustain Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
unwise Arg-I
to Arg-I
trade Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
longer Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
some Arg-I
late Arg-I
night Arg-I
parties Arg-I
or Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
to Arg-B
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
physiological Arg-I
and Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
changes Arg-I
of Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
financial Arg-I
life Arg-I
a Arg-I
less Arg-I
struggle Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
oneself Arg-I
digress Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
destined Arg-I
path Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
longer Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Technology O
impact O
on O
people O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
Earth O
has O
become O
like O
a O
small O
village O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
last O
hundred O
years O
, O
the O
way O
majority O
of O
people O
communicate O
with O
each O
other O
has O
been O
altered O
significantly O
because O
of O
technology O
. O

But O
there O
are O
vast O
amount O
of O
disputes O
whether O
it O
is O
positive O
or O
negative O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
this Arg-B
development Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
positive Arg-I
one Arg-I
in O
spite O
of O
its O
some O
drawbacks O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
in Arg-I
touch Arg-I
with Arg-I
loved Arg-I
ones Arg-I
in Arg-I
faraway Arg-I
places Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
easy Arg-I
than Arg-I
ever Arg-I
. O

Technology Arg-B
revolutionized Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
we Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
and O
in O
present O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
almost Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
everything Arg-I
without Arg-I
tete Arg-I
- Arg-I
a Arg-I
- Arg-I
tete Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
software Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Skype Arg-I
, Arg-I
MSN Arg-I
, Arg-I

Whatsapp Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
in Arg-I
touch Arg-I
with Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
we Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
earlier Arg-I
times Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
did Arg-I
n't Arg-I
leave Arg-I
for Arg-I
faraway Arg-I
places Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
could Arg-I
easily Arg-I
get Arg-I
lost Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
one Arg-I
salient Arg-I
prove Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
positive Arg-I
. O

Further O
, O
by Arg-B
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
communication Arg-I
tools Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
very Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

According Arg-B
to Arg-I
statistics Arg-I
, Arg-I
40 Arg-I
% Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
met Arg-I
even Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
partners Arg-I
via Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
Internet Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
basic Arg-I
tool Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
in Arg-I
touch Arg-I
with Arg-I
old Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
is O
that O
, O
by Arg-B
communicating Arg-I
via Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
or Arg-I
phone Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
express Arg-I
our Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
and Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
fully Arg-I
, O
because O
during Arg-B
such Arg-I
conversations Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
words Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
completely Arg-I
different Arg-I
sense Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the Arg-B
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
divorces Arg-I
is Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
day Arg-I
by Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
I O
once O
again O
restate O
my O
position O
that O
the Arg-B
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
impacted Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
among Arg-I
people Arg-I
very Arg-I
positively Arg-I
by Arg-I
making Arg-I
it Arg-I
easier Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
. O

Advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
machines O
instead O
of O
human O
to O
do O
the O
work O

The O
issue O
of O
whether O
using O
of O
machine O
are O
bring O
many O
advantages O
to O
society O
is O
of O
great O
concern O
to O
many O
people O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
although Arg-B
using Arg-I
machines Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
ignore Arg-I
its Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undoubted O
that O
machines Arg-B
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
machines Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
than Arg-I
human Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
like Arg-I
human Arg-I
, Arg-I
machines Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
rest Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
employers Arg-I
want Arg-I
and Arg-I
consistently Arg-I
produce Arg-I
high Arg-I
quality Arg-I
products Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

For O
another O
, O
using Arg-B
machines Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
company Arg-I
's Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Because O
machines Arg-B
never Arg-I
ask Arg-I
for Arg-I
salary Arg-I
, Arg-I
over Arg-I
- Arg-I
time Arg-I
pay Arg-I
or Arg-I
pension Arg-I
, O
so O
employers Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
employee Arg-I
's Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
company Arg-I
only Arg-I
needs Arg-I
some Arg-I
technicians Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
machines Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
track Arg-I
or Arg-I
replace Arg-I
some Arg-I
part Arg-I
when Arg-I
machines Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
disadvantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
machines Arg-I
that Arg-I
bring Arg-I
to Arg-I
us Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
neglected Arg-I
by Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
because Arg-B
of Arg-I
extensive Arg-I
of Arg-I
using Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
loss Arg-I
their Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Especially Arg-B
in Arg-I
large Arg-I
population Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
high Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
may Arg-I
cause Arg-I
crime Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
instability Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
, O
using Arg-B
of Arg-I
machines Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
pose Arg-I
serious Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
energy Arg-I
dissipation Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
people Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
dish Arg-I
- Arg-I
washing Arg-I
machine Arg-I
to Arg-I
wash Arg-I
dishes Arg-I
and Arg-I
plates Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
hand Arg-I
washing Arg-I
. O

But O
they Arg-B
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
that Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
hand Arg-I
washing Arg-I
dish Arg-I
- Arg-I
washing Arg-I
machine Arg-I
consume Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
2 Arg-I
times Arg-I
water Arg-I
and Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
to Arg-I
wash Arg-I
these Arg-I
tableware Arg-I
. O

As O
you O
can O
imagine O
, O
if Arg-B
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
families Arg-I
use Arg-I
dish Arg-I
- Arg-I
washing Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
many Arg-I
water Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
much Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
! O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
deny Arg-I
machines Arg-I
are Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
vital Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
living Arg-I
and Arg-I
working Arg-I
, O
problems Arg-B
posed Arg-I
by Arg-I
machines Arg-I
should Arg-I
draws Arg-I
more Arg-I
attentions Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Not O

this O

an O

them O

on O
their O

This O
essay O
will O
compare O
both O
negative O
and O
positive O

of O
this O

on O
infants O
. O

Fame Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
public Arg-I
people Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
admirers Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
sensitive Arg-I
to Arg-I
any Arg-I
acts Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
idols Arg-I
. O

Celebrity Arg-B
scandals Arg-I
and Arg-I
gossips Arg-I
can Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
reach Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
which Arg-I
perceive Arg-I
it Arg-I
very Arg-I
negatively Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
that O
celebrities Arg-B
who Arg-I
received Arg-I
attention Arg-I
for Arg-I
overuse Arg-I
of Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
or Arg-I
alcohol Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
public Arg-I
disgrace Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
children Arg-B
may Arg-I
see Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
is Arg-I
inexcusable Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
too Arg-B
much Arg-I
news Arg-I
coverage Arg-I
to Arg-I
famous Arg-I
people Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
choice Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
professions Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
recent Arg-I
surveys Arg-I
showed Arg-I
, Arg-I
inspired Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
fame Arg-I
and Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
now Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
an Arg-I
actor Arg-I
/ Arg-I
actress Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
sports Arg-I
star Arg-I
than Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
schools Arg-I
for Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
of Arg-I
so Arg-I
- Arg-I
called Arg-I
stars Arg-I
and Arg-I
various Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
about Arg-I
famous Arg-I
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
mislead Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I
profession Arg-I
is Arg-I
highly Arg-I
required Arg-I
and Arg-I
easy Arg-I
reachable Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
may Arg-I
confuse Arg-I
children Arg-I
who Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
choose Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
influence Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
mass Arg-I

, Arg-I
but Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
basis Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I

. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
parents Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
worried Arg-I
about Arg-I

Recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
in O
regards O
to O
whether O
mobile O
phones O
have O
a O
negative O
effect O
in O
our O
social O
communication O
. O

Indeed O
, O
mobile O
phones O
have O
been O
widely O
used O
for O
people O
of O
all O
ages O
, O
bringing O
convenience O
and O
entertainment O
into O
our O
life O
. O

However O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
this Arg-B
great Arg-I
invention Arg-I
causes Arg-I
many Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
spending Arg-B
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
phones Arg-I
may Arg-I
exert Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
social Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
as Arg-B
people Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
and Arg-I
relay Arg-I
on Arg-I
phones Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
interest Arg-I
on Arg-I
daily Arg-I
activities Arg-I
like Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
so O
that O
distraction Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
developed Arg-I
during Arg-I
study Arg-I
or Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
continuous Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
may Arg-I
damage Arg-I
both Arg-I
eyesight Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
posture Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
games Arg-I
available Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
phone Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
in Arg-I
nature Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
" Arg-I
Iron Arg-I
man Arg-I
" Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
those Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
for Arg-I
being Arg-I
more Arg-I
violent Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
violence Arg-I
is Arg-I
repeated Arg-I
again Arg-I
and Arg-I
again Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many Arg-B
games Arg-I
involve Arg-I
children Arg-I
helping Arg-I
their Arg-I
character Arg-I
to Arg-I
kill Arg-I
or Arg-I
shoot Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
many Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
increased Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
, Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
and Arg-I
behaviours Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
hardship Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
developed Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
other O
people O
may O
perceive O
this O
issue O
from O
different O
viewpoint O
. O

With Arg-B
rapid Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
quick Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
communication Arg-I
via Arg-I
internet Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
as Arg-B
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
chatting Arg-I
apps Arg-I
available Arg-I
online Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
" Arg-I
Weichat Arg-I
" Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
send Arg-I
instant Arg-I
messages Arg-I
free Arg-I
of Arg-I
charge Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
their Arg-I
phones Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
have Arg-I
shortened Arg-I
the Arg-I
distance Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication O
. O

After O
having O
considered O
all O
the O
problems O
that O
I O
have O
discussed O
above O
, O
we O
can O
finally O
draw O
a O
conclusion O
that O
although O
mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
brings Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
also Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Modern O
forms O
of O
communication O
; O
' O
electronic O
letter O
' O
Undoubtedly O
, O
the O
movement O
of O
modern O
forms O
of O
communication O
has O
changed O
better O
, O
which O
help O
people O
to O
interact O
to O
others O
, O
such O
as O
email O
and O
messaging O
without O
limitation O
time O
. O

I O
totally O
agree O
that O
using Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
soft Arg-I
devices Arg-I
have Arg-I
cut Arg-I
much Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
people Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
relatives Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
had Arg-I
some Arg-I
demerits Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
social Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Mentioned O
to O
societies O
life O
style O
, O
they Arg-B
constantly Arg-I
use Arg-I
these Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
electronic Arg-I
letter Arg-I
for Arg-I
making Arg-I
fellowship Arg-I
or Arg-I
just Arg-I
continuing Arg-I
theirs Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
already Arg-I
had Arg-I
. O

Obviousness O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
other Arg-I
ways Arg-I
like Arg-I
social Arg-I
media Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
could Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
it Arg-I
for Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
theirs Arg-I
buddies Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Twitter Arg-I
and Arg-I
Facebook Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
communication Arg-I
become Arg-I
feasible Arg-I
and Arg-I
limitless Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Another O
perspective O
, O
using Arg-B
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
has Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
netizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
unsociable Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
caused Arg-I
they Arg-I
were Arg-I
swept Arg-I
away Arg-I
by Arg-I
virtual Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
much Arg-I
social Arg-I
live Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

The O
consequence O
of O
this O
case O
made O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
become Arg-I
geek Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
of Arg-I
using Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
, Arg-I
without Arg-I
direct Arg-I
contacts Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
people Arg-B
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
own Arg-I
minded Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
connection Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
, Arg-I
meet Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
talk Arg-I
by Arg-I
face Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
directly Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
admittedly O
and O
strongly O
agree O
that O
the Arg-B
merits Arg-I
of Arg-I
email Arg-I
and Arg-I
messaging Arg-I
have Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
ours Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
gathering Arg-I
with Arg-I
our Arg-I
colleague Arg-I
. O

People O
should O
create O
a O
sense O
of O
co O
- O
operation O
in O
their O
children O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
children O
have O
an O
innocent O
mind O
, O
and O
they O
requires O
a O
proper O
guidance O
at O
a O
specific O
time O
to O
make O
them O
understand O
the O
value O
of O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
it O
is O
better O
to O
make O
them O
competitive O
, O
while O
other O
believes O
to O
make O
them O
co O
- O
operative O
. O

Both O
these O
factors O
have O
their O
own O
values O
, O
and O
have O
been O
discussed O
in O
detail O
below O
: O
Competitive Arg-B
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
confident Arg-I
enough Arg-I
to Arg-I
handle Arg-I
the Arg-I
situations Arg-I
independently Arg-I
. O

This O
factor O
initially O
arises O
from O
the O
school O
, O
where O
teacher O
encourages O
student O
to O
feel O
more O
competitive O
through O
the O
grading O
system O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
place O
where O
children O
are O
trying O
to O
get O
on O
the O
top O
by O
scoring O
the O
highest O
marks O
. O

This Arg-B
factor Arg-I
will Arg-I
lead Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
, O
but O
will O
also O
restrict O
them O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

For O
example O
, O
MNCs Arg-B
are Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
focusing Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
mind Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
in Arg-I
managing Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
those Arg-B
who Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operation Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
symbol Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
sensible Arg-I
enough Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
. O

Although O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
pace Arg-I
and Arg-I
an Arg-I
eager Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
top Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
competitors Arg-I
do Arg-I
, O
but O
they Arg-B
shall Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
art Arg-I
of Arg-I
managing Arg-I
different Arg-I
situations Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
though O
competitive Arg-B
children Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
clever Arg-I
and Arg-I
faster Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operative Arg-I
child Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
initial Arg-I
level Arg-I
, O
but O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
success Arg-I
path Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
long Arg-I
run Arg-I
; O
while O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
co Arg-B
- Arg-I
operative Arg-I
child Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
potential Arg-I
of Arg-I
structuring Arg-I
and Arg-I
implementing Arg-I
new Arg-I
and Arg-I
innovative Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
operation Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
feel Arg-I
more Arg-I
accomplished Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Man O
to O
man O
interaction O
changed O
Nowadays O
, O
the O
variety O
of O
communication O
systems O
used O
widely O
. O

As O
technology O
develops O
, O
it O
has O
negative O
influences O
in O
many O
respects O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
agree O
with O
that O
the Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
large Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

The O
main O
advantage O
is O
that O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
enabled Arg-I
people Arg-I
stay Arg-I
in Arg-I
contact Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
more Arg-I
closely Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
public Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
or Arg-I
smart Arg-I
phone Arg-I
to Arg-I
share Arg-I
information Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
at Arg-I
different Arg-I
positions Arg-I
. O

Instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
using Arg-I
letters Arg-I
, Arg-I
technology Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
gives Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
and Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
. O

More O
, O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
connect Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
though Arg-I
the Arg-I
images Arg-I
or Arg-I
videos Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
feel Arg-I
close Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
technology Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
essential Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
remote Arg-I
districts Arg-I
, Arg-I
shared Arg-I
the Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Another O
issue O
is O
that O
in O
the O
ever O
- O
accelerated O
updating O
of O
science O
and O
technology O
, O
technology Arg-B
provides Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
establish Arg-I
the Arg-I
social Arg-I
network Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
might Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
pen Arg-I
friends Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
now Arg-I
, Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
social Arg-I
networking Arg-I
websites Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
similar Arg-I
interests Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
connect Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
touch Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
technology Arg-B
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
develops Arg-I
positive Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
the Arg-B
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
optimal Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
, O
because O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

Sense O
of O
cooperation O

In O
present O
educational O
system O
there O
are O
variety O
of O
competitions O
in O
academic O
area O
and O
athletic O
area O
for O
children O
to O
attend O
, O
which O
could O
stimulating O
the O
will O
of O
children O
to O
learn O
and O
to O
achieve O
the O
best O
of O
them O
, O
and O
also O
be O
able O
to O
teach O
them O
teamwork O
skill O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
is O
better O
to O
make O
children O
be O
competitive O
than O
cooperative O
, O
both O
the O
values O
have O
its O
arguments O
. O

A Arg-B
strong Arg-I
competition Arg-I
sense Arg-I
helps Arg-I
children Arg-I
having Arg-I
urge Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
practice Arg-I
for Arg-I
being Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
among Arg-I
peers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
factor Arg-I
is Arg-I
initially Arg-I
arises Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
highest Arg-I
scores Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
grading Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Even O
though O
a Arg-B
competitive Arg-I
child Arg-I
is Arg-I
usually Arg-I
more Arg-I
motivated Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursue Arg-I
a Arg-I
goal Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
independently Arg-I
, O
but O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
risky Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
too Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperating Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
competitive Arg-I
leads Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
could Arg-I
also Arg-I
restrict Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
it Arg-B
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
hard Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
or Arg-I
manage Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
work Arg-I
project Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
cooperation Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
quality Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
activities Arg-I
or Arg-I
in Arg-I
communities Arg-I
. O

Having Arg-B
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
cooperating Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
helps Arg-I
kids Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
gives Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
a Arg-I
goal Arg-I
easily Arg-I
by Arg-I
working Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
in Arg-B
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
who Arg-I
could Arg-I
has Arg-I
big Arg-I
achievement Arg-I

For O
example O
, O
famous Arg-B
singers Arg-I
or Arg-I
movie Arg-I
stars Arg-I
, Arg-I
despite Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
talent Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I

there Arg-I

deal Arg-I

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
though O
competitive Arg-B
child Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
and Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
that Arg-I

them Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I

but O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
not Arg-I

them Arg-I
much Arg-I
once Arg-I
they Arg-I
enter Arg-I

society Arg-I
or Arg-I
company Arg-I
which Arg-I
required Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
skill Arg-I
of Arg-I
team Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
schools Arg-B
and Arg-I
adults Arg-I
should Arg-I
put Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
a Arg-I
useful Arg-I
adult Arg-I
whether Arg-I

Discuss O
both O
harms O

good O
of O

give O
your O
opinion O
On O
these O
days O

with O
the O
assistance O

, O
people O
easily O
purchase O
the O

Although O
some O
people O
claim O
that O
the O
advantages O
of O
advertising O
are O
outweigh O
the O
advantages O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
advertisement Arg-B
bring Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
harms Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
most Arg-B
advertisements Arg-I
so Arg-I
exaggerate Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
products Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
often Arg-I
ignore Arg-I
some Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
of Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
sell Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
all Arg-B
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
are Arg-I
advertised Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
ones Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
confusing Arg-I
for Arg-I
users Arg-I
in Arg-I
picking Arg-I
out Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
goods Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
some Arg-B
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
shampoo Arg-I
, Arg-I
namely Arg-I
Sunsilk Arg-I
, Arg-I
Clear Arg-I

Dove Arg-I

recreate Arg-I
injured Arg-I
hair Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
not Arg-B
all Arg-I
customers Arg-I
are Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
bought Arg-I
under Arg-I
the Arg-I
introduction Arg-I
from Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
market Arg-I
gives Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
from Arg-I
producers Arg-I
, Arg-I

all Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
as Arg-I

as Arg-I
their Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
demands Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
advertisement Arg-B
enables Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
users Arg-I
in Arg-I
getting Arg-I
accustomed Arg-I
to Arg-I
enterprises Arg-I
and Arg-I
know Arg-I
thoroughly Arg-I
items Arg-I
sold Arg-I
from Arg-I
these Arg-I
producers Arg-I

Take Arg-B
Coca Arg-I

for Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
drinking Arg-I
firm Arg-I
is Arg-I
well Arg-I

one Arg-I
of Arg-I
companies Arg-I

a Arg-I
major Arg-I
part Arg-I

No Arg-B
wonder Arg-I
why Arg-I
this Arg-I

Last O

the Arg-I

To O

up O

everything O

and O
advertisement O
is O
not O
an O
exception O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
advertising O
will O
be O
better O
if O
producers O
and O
advertisers O
are O
more O
honest O
in O
producing O
advertisements O
to O
give O

High O
sum O
of O

of O

The O

In O
a O

modern O

may O

Although O
some O

take O
a O
responsibility O
for O
this O
unfair O
situation O
, O

I O
agree O
that O
in Arg-B

brings Arg-I
perfectness Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I

work Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
while O
the Arg-B
modern Arg-I
artists Arg-I
who Arg-I
implement Arg-I
their Arg-I
creative Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
onto Arg-I
high Arg-I

are Arg-I
paid Arg-I
with Arg-I
immense Arg-I

by Arg-I
the Arg-I

collector Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
the Arg-B
high Arg-I
sum Arg-I
which Arg-I
modern Arg-I
artists Arg-I
receive Arg-I
is Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
quantity Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
rare Arg-I

For O

with Arg-I

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
modern Arg-B
artists Arg-I
also Arg-I
devote Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
unique Arg-I
concept Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
do Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
making Arg-I

He Arg-B

In O
any O

several Arg-I

the Arg-B

plays Arg-I
the Arg-I
song Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I

Moreover O
, O
government Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
equalize Arg-I
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
creation Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I

because O
there Arg-B

no Arg-I
certain Arg-I

Having O

that O
the Arg-B

I O
agree O
that O

can Arg-I
not Arg-I
take Arg-I
steps Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
salary Arg-I
between Arg-I
modern Arg-I

Working O
Extended O
hours O
should O
restricted O
Working O
longer O
hours O
is O
becoming O
prevalent O
in O
these O
days O
. O

There O
is O
a O
saying O
in O
my O
native O
village O
, O
" O
Health O
is O
Wealth O
" O
. O

I O
believe O
many O
of O
people O
including O
me O
are O
not O
really O
considering O
the O
importance O
of O
health O
. O

The O
need O
for O
increased O
working O
hours O
might O
be O
because O
of O
enhanced O
competitive O
environment O
and O
desire O
to O
acquire O
much O
money O
and O
promotion O
. O

However O
, O
people Arg-B
working Arg-I
for Arg-I
extended Arg-I
hours Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
found Arg-I
having Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
a Arg-B
balance Arg-I
between Arg-I
personal Arg-I
and Arg-I
professional Arg-I
life Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
created Arg-I
by Arg-I
restricting Arg-I
maximum Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
many O
of O
us O
would O
agree O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
people Arg-B
; Arg-I
who Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
working Arg-I
longer Arg-I
hours Arg-I
, Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
working Arg-I
too Arg-I
long Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
often Arg-I
become Arg-I
tired Arg-I
, Arg-I
lazy Arg-I
and Arg-I
reluctant Arg-I
to Arg-I
carry Arg-I
out Arg-I
physical Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
remain Arg-I
fit Arg-I
and Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
and Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
loose Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
sick Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
become Arg-I
extensively Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
workaholic Arg-I
type Arg-I
persons Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
repercussion Arg-I
are Arg-I
so Arg-I
severe Arg-I
that Arg-I
their Arg-I
families Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
remain Arg-I
deprived Arg-I
off Arg-I
their Arg-I
attention Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
they Arg-I
end Arg-I
up Arg-I
losing Arg-I
balance Arg-I
between Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
these Arg-B
workaholic Arg-I
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
by Arg-I
actively Arg-I
participating Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
social Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
. O

As O
they Arg-B
usually Arg-I
remain Arg-I
busy Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
office Arg-I
so O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
such Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
take Arg-I
my Arg-I
boss Arg-I
's Arg-I
example Arg-I
; Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
working Arg-I
for Arg-I
extended Arg-I
hours Arg-I
in Arg-I
office Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Recently Arg-B
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
personal Arg-I
life Arg-I
was Arg-I
drastically Arg-I
affected Arg-I
as Arg-I
he Arg-I
broke Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
wife Arg-I
and Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
life Arg-I
has Arg-I
totally Arg-I
been Arg-I
in Arg-I
chaos Arg-I
and Arg-I
cries Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
started Arg-I
regretting Arg-I
afterwards Arg-I
and Arg-I
now Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
his Arg-I
work Arg-I

but Arg-I
it Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
too Arg-I
late Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
this O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
emphasis Arg-I
and Arg-I
recommend Arg-I
, Arg-I
Government Arg-I
must Arg-I
include Arg-I
the Arg-I
clause Arg-I
of Arg-I
maximum Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
hours Arg-I
in Arg-I
its Arg-I
Labor Arg-I
Law Arg-I
and Arg-I
enforce Arg-I
to Arg-I
all Arg-I
companies Arg-I
for Arg-I
ensuring Arg-I
their Arg-I
employees Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
spend Arg-I
extended Arg-I
hours Arg-I
in Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
in Arg-I
uplift Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
bring Arg-I
the Arg-I
lost Arg-I
equilibrium Arg-I
between Arg-I
personal Arg-I
and Arg-I
professional Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
individual Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

A O
successful O

It O

such O

especially O
in O
nowadays O
society O

Each O
individual O
visualize O

differently O
. O

Still O
, O
my Arg-B
term Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
successful Arg-I
man Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
certain Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
one Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

Money Arg-B
is Arg-I
undeniably Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
, O
but O
ways Arg-B
of Arg-I
earning Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
various Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
great Arg-I
prosperity Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
state Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
gained Arg-I
it Arg-I
ethically Arg-I
by Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
a Arg-B
man Arg-I
can Arg-I
only Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
his Arg-I
accomplishment Arg-I
through Arg-I
hard Arg-I
- Arg-I
working Arg-I
, Arg-I
dedication Arg-I
and Arg-I
passion Arg-I
. O

Whether Arg-B
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
social Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
man Arg-I
is Arg-I
laudable Arg-I
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
his Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
successful Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
considered Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Thomas Arg-B
Edison Arg-I
is Arg-I
undeniably Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
inventors Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
20th Arg-I
century Arg-I
since O
his Arg-B
invention Arg-I
's Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
is Arg-I
countless Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
mankind Arg-I

On O
the O

the Arg-B
fact Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowing Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
's Arg-I
utilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I

in Arg-I
the Arg-I
dark Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
judging Arg-B
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
by Arg-I
his Arg-I
income Arg-I
is Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
success Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
using Arg-B
only Arg-I
money Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
scale Arg-I
to Arg-I
measure Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I

success Arg-I
is Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
essential Arg-I
in Arg-I
basic Arg-I

Yet O
, O
it O
is O
the O

that O

heavily O

by O
various O
of O
advertising O
on O
television O

etc O
. O

This O
argument O
may O
be O
true O
that O
people Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
swayed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
and Arg-I
buy Arg-I
things Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
it Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
most Arg-I
asian Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
company Arg-I
usually Arg-I
hire Arg-I
popular Arg-I
singers Arg-I
or Arg-I
actors Arg-I
to Arg-I
advertise Arg-I
the Arg-I
products Arg-I
to Arg-I
boosts Arg-I
the Arg-I
sales Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
adolescent Arg-I
may Arg-I
buy Arg-I
things Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
favourite Arg-I
singer Arg-I
advertised Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
their Arg-I
idol Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
to Arg-I
fill Arg-I
their Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
products Arg-B
usually Arg-I
look Arg-I
more Arg-I
gorgeous Arg-I
and Arg-I
with Arg-I
good Arg-I
quality Arg-I
in Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
goods Arg-I
impulsively Arg-I
without Arg-I
a Arg-I
second Arg-I
thought Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
good Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
can Arg-I
convince Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

And O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
people Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
particular Arg-I
products Arg-I
swayed Arg-I
by Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
it Arg-I
a Arg-I
trend Arg-I
to Arg-I
follow Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
unnecessarily Arg-I
need Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
buying Arg-B
habit Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
personal Arg-I
things Arg-I
for Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
advertisement Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
cause Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
, O
sometimes Arg-B
it Arg-I
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
needs Arg-I
and Arg-I
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
consumption Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
unlikely Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
things Arg-I
impulsively Arg-I
for Arg-I
adults Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
concern Arg-I
of Arg-I
arranging Arg-I
disposable Arg-I
income Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
allocate Arg-I
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
doing Arg-I
other Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children Arg-B
and Arg-I
adolescents Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
economic Arg-I
independence Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
possible Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
things Arg-I
impulsively Arg-I
without Arg-I
considering Arg-I
whether Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
it Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
, O
since O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
financial Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
from Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
define Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
think O
buying Arg-B
habit Arg-I
is Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
choice Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
entirely Arg-I
affected Arg-I
by Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
. O

But O
for Arg-B
children Arg-I
or Arg-I
adolescents Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
mentally Arg-I
develop Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
hard Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
swayed Arg-I
by Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

So O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
that Arg-I
government Arg-I
needs Arg-I
to Arg-I
impose Arg-I
rules Arg-I
on Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
company Arg-I
( Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
toys Arg-I
company Arg-I
) Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
youngster Arg-I

have Arg-I
bias Arg-I
thought Arg-I
on Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
really Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

Schools O
should O
only O
teach O
children O
the O
academic O
subject O
People O
have O
many O
different O
views O
about O
what O
subjects O
should O
be O
taught O
in O
school O
. O

Although O
I O
accept O
that O
students O
have O
to O
study O
many O
subjects O
in O
school O
, O
I Arg-B
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
unimportant Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
sports Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
got Arg-I
rid Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
program Arg-I
. O

Many O
people O
believe O
that O
students Arg-B
only Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
like Arg-I
mathematics Arg-I
, Arg-I
physics Arg-I
because O
these Arg-B
subject Arg-I
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
understandable O
when Arg-B
labor Arg-I
market Arg-I
now Arg-I
has Arg-I
high Arg-I
competition Arg-I
; Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
regard Arg-I
of Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
high Arg-I
, O
so O
their O
parents Arg-B
want Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
these Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Although O
those O
above O
reasons O
are O
acceptable O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
things Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
studying Arg-B
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
art Arg-I
or Arg-I
sports Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
enables Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
potentials Arg-I
through Arg-I
discovering Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
world Arg-I
around Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
to Arg-B
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
labor Arg-I
market Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
do Arg-I
students Arg-I
require Arg-I
hard Arg-I
skills Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
soft Arg-I
skills Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
, Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
through Arg-B
taking Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
sport Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
team Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
about Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
these Arg-B
subjects Arg-I
might Arg-I
fulfil Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
ability Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
children Arg-B
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
depend Arg-I
heavily Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
they Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
and Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
the Arg-B
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
primary Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
nurturing Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
it O
seem O
to O
me O
that O
the Arg-B
effects Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
sports Arg-I
are Arg-I
profound Arg-I
. O

Internet O
will O
end O
the O
era O
of O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
Digital O
media O
has O
been O
extremely O
popular O
among O
people O
around O
the O
globe O
. O

With O
this O
advancement O
, O
newspapers O
and O
magazines O
are O
struggling O
to O
justify O
their O
existence O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
traditional O
paper O
media O
will O
come O
to O
an O
end O
very O
soon O
due O
to O
the O
increased O
usage O
of O
internet O
based O
media O
. O

But O
many O
other O
still O
thinks O
they O
are O
going O
to O
stay O
. O

I O
agree O
to O
the O
argument O
that O
newspapers Arg-B
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
history Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
establish O
my O
view O
by O
analysing O
how O
internet Arg-B
presents Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
affair Arg-I
so Arg-I
fast Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
accessibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
historical Arg-I
news Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
media Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
publish Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
affairs Arg-I
as Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
specially Arg-I
when Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
helps Arg-I
readers Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
updated Arg-I
and Arg-I
act Arg-I
accordingly Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
the Arg-I
aircraft Arg-I
MH Arg-I
370 Arg-I
went Arg-I
missing Arg-I
, Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
details Arg-I
about Arg-I
this Arg-I
tragic Arg-I
incident Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
families Arg-I
of Arg-I
passengers Arg-I
and Arg-I
crews Arg-I
were Arg-I
impatient Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
truth Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
such Arg-I
situations Arg-I
, Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
respond Arg-I
as Arg-I
fast Arg-I
as Arg-I
digital Arg-I
media Arg-I
. O

Instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
waiting Arg-I
for Arg-I
next Arg-I
publication Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
trustworthy Arg-I
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
incidents Arg-I
from Arg-I
internet Arg-I
within Arg-I
an Arg-I
hour Arg-I
or Arg-I
two Arg-I
. O

This O
explains O
why O
digital Arg-B
media Arg-I
will Arg-I
rule Arg-I
over Arg-I
paper Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
often Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
access Arg-I
news Arg-I
from Arg-I
past Arg-I
for Arg-I
various Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
for Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
interest Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
one Arg-B
research Arg-I
fellow Arg-I
may Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
village Arg-I
named Arg-I
Oramaki Arg-I
in Arg-I
Japan Arg-I
was Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
after Arg-I
Second Arg-I
World Arg-I
War Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
this Arg-I
sort Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
from Arg-I
past Arg-I
in Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
as Arg-I
one Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
before Arg-I
where Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
at Arg-I
. O

But O
internet Arg-B
provides Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
search Arg-I
facility Arg-I
where Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
search Arg-I
the Arg-I
topic Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
details Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
feature Arg-I
of Arg-I
digital Arg-I
media Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
supported Arg-I
by Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the Arg-B
fast Arg-I
responding Arg-I
internet Arg-I
media Arg-I
with Arg-I
vast Arg-I
information Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
replacing Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
and Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
as Arg-I
new Arg-I
and Arg-I
information Arg-I
provider Arg-I
for O
valid O
reasons O
. O

Though O
considering Arg-B
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
and Arg-I
mindset Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I

Factor O
of O

In O
many O
societies O
, O
choice O
of O
a O
job O
depends O
on O
the O
size O
of O
the O
salary O
offered O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
while O
I O
admit O
that O
the Arg-B
salary Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
factor Arg-I
, O
I O
claim O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
other Arg-I
equally Arg-I
vital Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
that Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
regard Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
in Arg-B
order Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
cover Arg-I
their Arg-I
daily Arg-I
and Arg-I
general Arg-I
needs Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
money Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
aspects Arg-B
such Arg-I

: Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
, Arg-I
environment Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
- Arg-I
place Arg-I

, Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I

have Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
, Arg-I
for Arg-I

, Arg-I
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
like Arg-I
their Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
workers Arg-I
and Arg-I
working Arg-I
condition Arg-I
are Arg-I
considered Arg-I
less Arg-I
satisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
despite Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
salary Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
it O
is O
also O
one O
very O
salient O
proof O
of O
the O
accuracy O
of O
my O
position O
. O

Further O
and O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
satisfaction Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
professional Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
, Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
position Arg-I

reach Arg-I

In O

career Arg-B

getting Arg-I
some Arg-I

of Arg-I

from Arg-I
the Arg-I

of Arg-I
a Arg-I
company Arg-I
or Arg-I
organization Arg-I
are Arg-I
, Arg-I
likely Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
than Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I

. O

For O
example O
, O
people Arg-B
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
monotonous Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
where Arg-I
no Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
positions Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I

feel Arg-I
themselves Arg-I

dissatisfied Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
good Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
salary Arg-I
outweighs Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
motivators Arg-I
, O
as O
there Arg-B

other Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I

such Arg-I
as Arg-I

workers Arg-I

working Arg-I
conditions Arg-I

professional Arg-I
achievements Arg-I

Children O
from O
poorer O

are O
more O
successful O
in O
the O
future O
life O
. O

According O
to O
some O
people O
, O
child O
who O
is O
brought O
up O
in O
less O
well O
- O
off O
family O
is O
more O
quick O
- O
witted O
and O
can O
tackle O
with O
an O
adult O
life O
problems O
better O
than O
who O
is O
from O
affluent O
ones O
. O

However O
, O
I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
this O
position O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
children Arg-B
from Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
families Arg-I
are Arg-I
prone Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
bad Arg-I
habits Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
: Arg-I
crime Arg-I
, Arg-I
thievery Arg-I
and Arg-I
thuggery Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
proselytized Arg-I
into Arg-I
bad Arg-I
isms Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
terroristic Arg-I
groups Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
attract Arg-I
uneducated Arg-I
people Arg-I
, O
because O
the Arg-B
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
wider Arg-I
outlook Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
allow Arg-I
no Arg-I
brainwash Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
people Arg-B
with Arg-I
lower Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
proneness Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
attracted Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
isms Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O

people Arg-B

born Arg-I
in Arg-I
well Arg-I

off Arg-I
families Arg-I

good Arg-I
education Arg-I

which Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
later Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
children Arg-B
from Arg-I
rich Arg-I
families Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
skills Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
money Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
use Arg-I
it Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
wealthy Arg-B
families Arg-I
can Arg-I
afford Arg-I
better Arg-I
health Arg-I
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
costly Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many Arg-B
good Arg-I
medicines Arg-I
cost Arg-I
vast Arg-I
amounts Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
afforded Arg-I
by Arg-I
poorer Arg-I
families Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
brought Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
less Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
families Arg-I
are Arg-I
, Arg-I
likely Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
due O
to O
aforementioned O
reasons O
. O

Recent O
medical O
problems O
and O
sedentary O
lifestyle O
. O

It O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
modern Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
up Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
health Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
ailments Arg-I
than Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

Many O
people O
claim O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
sedentary Arg-I
lifestlyle Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
while O
I O
accept O
that O
sedentary O
lifestyle O
is O
one O
of O
the O
key O
factors O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
some O
other O
factors O
are O
having O
even O
a O
greater O
impact O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
sedentary Arg-B
lifestyle Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
serious Arg-I
health Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
main Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
so Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
homes Arg-I
even Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
day Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
advance Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
earlier Arg-I
times Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
the Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
tools Arg-I
were Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
large Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
and Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
required Arg-I
physical Arg-I
presence Arg-I
and O
as O
a O
result O
they Arg-B
had Arg-I
more Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
inhabitants Arg-I
of Arg-I
cities Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
spending Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
tools Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
are O
some O
other O
causes O
why O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
experiencing Arg-I
serious Arg-I
medical Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
world Arg-I
polluted Arg-I
very Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
from Arg-I
greenhouse Arg-I
gas Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
gasses Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
from Arg-I
allergy Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
these Arg-I
gasses Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
foods Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
low Arg-I
quality Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
fast Arg-I
foods Arg-I
, Arg-I
junk Arg-I
foods Arg-I
and Arg-I
any Arg-I
genetically Arg-I
modified Arg-I
ones Arg-I
are Arg-I
influencing Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
health Arg-I
very Arg-I
negatively Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
life Arg-B
becoming Arg-I
more Arg-I
stressful Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
recent Arg-I
problems Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
gam Arg-I
, Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
accidents Arg-I
and Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

Given O
these O
evidences O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
recently Arg-I
appeared Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
due O
to O
aforementioned O
reasons O
. O

Problems O
and O
benefits O
of O
international O
tourism O
Along O
with O
the O
advancement O
of O
long O
- O
distance O
transportation O
, O
international O
tourism O
has O
boomed O
in O
the O
last O
few O
decades O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
this O
has O
brought O
more O
problems O
than O
benefits O
. O

I O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

I O
admit O
that O
tourism Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
, Arg-I
local Arg-I
governments Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
more Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
infrastructures Arg-I
around Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
destruction Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
. O

Tourism Arg-B
also Arg-I
creates Arg-I
more Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
waste Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
growing Arg-I
emission Arg-I
of Arg-I
greenhouse Arg-I
gases Arg-I
, Arg-I
dumped Arg-I
leftovers Arg-I
and Arg-I
overuse Arg-I
of Arg-I
water Arg-I
, Arg-I
power Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
energy Arg-I
in Arg-I
luxurious Arg-I
hotels Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
these O
grounds O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
tourism Arg-B
puts Arg-I
great Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
ecosystem Arg-I
and Arg-I
local Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
flourishing Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
rewarding Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
local Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

Holiday Arg-B
makers Arg-I
flocking Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
bound Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
on Arg-I
tickets Arg-I
of Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
, Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
and Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
. O

Both Arg-B
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
governments Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
through Arg-I
these Arg-I
services Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
employment Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
created Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

I O
also O
believe O
the Arg-B
revenue Arg-I
earned Arg-I
form Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
turn Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
increasing Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
boon Arg-I
to Arg-I
travelers Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
provision Arg-I
of Arg-I
direct Arg-I
airlines Arg-I
makes Arg-I
it Arg-I
possible Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
conveniently Arg-I
and Arg-I
comfortably Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
adequate Arg-I
local Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
available Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
holidays Arg-I
having Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
relaxing Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
both Arg-B
locals Arg-I
and Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
can Arg-I
experience Arg-I
more Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
than Arg-I
ever Arg-I
before Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
open Arg-I
- Arg-I
minded Arg-I
to Arg-I
eliminate Arg-I
preconceptions Arg-I
and Arg-I
deepen Arg-I
mutual Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
among Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
prosperity Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
global Arg-I
scale Arg-I
. O

Although O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
outweighed Arg-I
by Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
tackled Arg-I
if Arg-I
proper Arg-I
measures Arg-I
are Arg-I
taken Arg-I
. O

How O
to O
learn O
children O
more O
efficiently O
Education O
is O
undeniably O
pivotal O
for O
an O
individual O
. O

Although O
, O
it O
is O
agreed O
that O
learning O
by O
watching O
TV O
is O
more O
effective O
to O
some O
children O
, O
I O
find O
it O
difficult O
not O
to O
oppose O
against O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
students O
spend O
more O
time O
on O
TVs O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
traditional Arg-B
education Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
stand Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
method Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
physical Arg-B
inactivity Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
encouraged Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
aim Arg-I
of Arg-I
bettering Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
' Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
classic Arg-B
teaching Arg-I
methods Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
scientifically Arg-I
proven Arg-I
and Arg-I
utilized Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
mode Arg-I
of Arg-I
educate Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

Technology Arg-B
and Arg-I
its Arg-I
advance Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
degrees Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
the Arg-I
educational Arg-I
industry Arg-I
positively Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
not Arg-I
changed Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
' Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

The O
fact O
that O
students Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
homework Arg-I
or Arg-I
researches Arg-I
on Arg-I
computers Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
libraries Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
illustration Arg-I
for Arg-I
this Arg-I
. O

Yet Arg-B
, Arg-I
monitors Arg-I
are Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
replace Arg-I
the Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
of Arg-I
educators Arg-I
since O
their Arg-B
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
adaptability Arg-I
is Arg-I
priceless Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
teacher Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
switched Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
unconscious Arg-I
screens Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
watching Arg-B
television Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
passive Arg-I
action Arg-I
and Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
by Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
periods Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
children Arg-B
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
such Arg-I
activities Arg-I
that Arg-I
interrelate Arg-I
to Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
, Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
, Arg-I
competition Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
perform Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
general Arg-I
terms Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
conducted Arg-I
experiment Arg-I
indicates Arg-I
out Arg-I
- Arg-I
performance Arg-I
in Arg-I
skills Arg-I
like Arg-I
differentiate Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
plants Arg-I
or Arg-I
animals Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
that Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
various Arg-I
activities Arg-I
in Arg-I
nature Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
spent Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
time Arg-I
watching Arg-I
documentaries Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
such Arg-B
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
equip Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
skill Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
future Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
learning Arg-B
by Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
suits Arg-I
some Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
kids Arg-B
should Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
to Arg-I
engage Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
passive Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

School Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
applying Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
procedure Arg-I
since Arg-I
for Arg-I
ages Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
it Arg-B
still Arg-I
performs Arg-I
at Arg-I
its Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
equip Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
with Arg-I
essential Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

The O
option O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
is O
advantage O
or O
disadvantage O

Undoubtedly O
this O
is O
an O
era O
of O
internet O
which O
impacts O
one O
's O
personal O
as O
well O
as O
professional O
life O
. O

The O
effect O
is O
seen O
more O
on O
the O
developed O
countries O
where O
people O
choose O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
instead O
of O
going O
to O
office O
or O
university O
. O

Some O
consider O
this O
approach O
to O
be O
an O
advantage O
while O
others O
reject O
this O
as O
a O
disadvantage O
. O

Both O
the O
points O
of O
views O
will O
be O
discussed O
in O
order O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the Arg-B
benefit Arg-I
that Arg-I
professionals Arg-I
or Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
by Arg-I
connecting Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
. O

For O
one O
, O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
working Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
work Arg-I
life Arg-I
balance Arg-I
. O

The O
best O
example O
is O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
mother Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
join Arg-I
her Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
take Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
her Arg-I
baby Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
also Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
desired Arg-I
flexibility Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
hours Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
students Arg-I
too Arg-I
, Arg-I
studying Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
attractive Arg-I
option Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
travelling Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
Universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
that Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
busy Arg-I
city Arg-I
like Arg-I
Tokyo Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
waste Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
travelling Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
by Arg-I
working Arg-I
or Arg-I
studying Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
one O
part O
of O
the O
society O
, O
has O
doubt O
over O
the O
productivity O
of O
people O
who O
prefers O
to O
work O
or O
study O
from O
home O
. O

Many O
employers O
argue O
that O
once Arg-B
an Arg-I
employee Arg-I
works Arg-I
from Arg-I
isolation Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
spends Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
communication Arg-I
via Arg-I
phone Arg-I
or Arg-I
email Arg-I
with Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
harms Arg-I
an Arg-I
employee Arg-I
's Arg-I
deliverable Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
affected Arg-I
too Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
clear Arg-I
their Arg-I
doubts Arg-I
in Arg-I
study Arg-I
topics Arg-I
instantly Arg-I
. O

Due O
to O
this O
they O
lag O
in O
their O
studies O
. O

These Arg-B
factors Arg-I
affect Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
or Arg-I
study Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Following O
both O
the O
point O
of O
views O
, O

the Arg-B
option Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
or Arg-I
studying Arg-I
from Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
thought Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
people O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
internet O
to O
work O
or O
study O
and O
improve O
on O
the O
disadvantages O
into O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Some O
celebrities O
misguide O
young O
people O
& O
some O
guide O
them O
in O
right O
direction O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
celebrities O
are O
known O
for O
their O
glamorous O
lifestyle O
rather O
than O
the O
work O
they O
do O
. O

While O
I O
agree O
this O
will O
bring O
negative O
impacts O
on O
the O
younger O
generation O
, O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
necessarily Arg-I
the Arg-I
case Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
ambitious Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
some Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
off Arg-I
their Arg-I
images Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
some Arg-B
movie Arg-I
starts Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
wearing Arg-I
luxury Arg-I
brand Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
and Arg-I
showing Arg-I
their Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
life Arg-I
style Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
media Arg-I
, Arg-I
thereby Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
attention Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
behave Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
image Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
may Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
extraordinary Arg-I
life Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
achieved Arg-I
without Arg-I
hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
attention Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
become Arg-I
focused Arg-I
on Arg-I
chasing Arg-I
the Arg-I
dream Arg-I
of Arg-I
celebrity Arg-I
status Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
detrimental O
to O
study O
and O
work O
ethics O
and O
habits O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
other Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
do Arg-I
set Arg-I
up Arg-I
role Arg-I
models Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
visible Arg-I
accomplishments Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
celebrities Arg-B
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
sports Arg-I
player Arg-I
whose Arg-I
performance Arg-I
and Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
directly Arg-I
seen Arg-I
by Arg-I
their Arg-I
fans Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
that O
people Arg-B
understand Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
efforts Arg-I
on Arg-I
training Arg-I
is Arg-I
directly Arg-I
linked Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
results Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
this Arg-B
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
made Arg-I
celebrity Arg-I
can Arg-I
inspire Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
talents Arg-I
through Arg-I
application Arg-I
and Arg-I
perseverance Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
other Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
musician Arg-I
also Arg-I
have Arg-I
achieved Arg-I
great Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
Michael Arg-I
Jackson Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
his Arg-I
works Arg-I
are Arg-I
widely Arg-I
spread Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
welcomed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
younger Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

His Arg-B
songs Arg-I
spread Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
care Arg-I
about Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
suggests Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
member Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
summary O
, O
although O
some Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
misguide Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
by Arg-I
showing Arg-I
their Arg-I
external Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
and Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
, O
other Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
do Arg-I
lead Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
direction Arg-I
. O

Children O
can O
effectively O
learn O
from O
watching O
television O
TV O
is O
an O
immense O
source O
of O
information O
and O
pupils O
can O
learn O
and O
develop O
various O
skills O
by O
watching O
it O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
by Arg-B
allowing Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
at Arg-I
both Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
house Arg-I
can Arg-I
adversely Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
overall Arg-I
growth Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
children Arg-I
spend Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
TV Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
negatively Arg-I
impact Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
TV Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
prime Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
data Arg-I
and Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
international Arg-I
and Arg-I
local Arg-I
news Arg-I
channels Arg-I
like Arg-I
BBC Arg-I
, Arg-I
CNBC Arg-I
, Arg-I
Etv Arg-I
Gujarati Arg-I
, Arg-I
Etv Arg-I
Marathi Arg-I
etc Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
updated Arg-I
about Arg-I
latest Arg-I
happenings Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
develop Arg-I
skills Arg-I
in Arg-I
extra Arg-I
- Arg-I
curriculum Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Cooking Arg-B
programs Arg-I
teach Arg-I
about Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
dishes Arg-I
and Arg-I
similarly Arg-I
, Arg-I
sports Arg-I
events Arg-I
like Arg-I
cricket Arg-I
, Arg-I
football Arg-I
can Arg-I
teach Arg-I
leadership Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
team Arg-I
building Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
communication Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
more Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
. O

But O
on O
other O
hand O
, O
watching Arg-B
TV Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
continuously Arg-I
long Arg-I
hours Arg-I
can Arg-I
adversely Arg-I
impact Arg-I
children Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
poor Arg-I
eyesight Arg-I
in Arg-I
early Arg-I
ages Arg-I
of Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
develop Arg-I
back Arg-I
pain Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
watch Arg-I
restrictive Arg-I
programs Arg-I
not Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
ages Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
major Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
times Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
get Arg-I
addictive Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
programs Arg-I
like Arg-I
Cartoon Arg-I
channels Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
baseball Arg-I
and Arg-I
easily Arg-I
get Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
from Arg-I
study Arg-I
during Arg-I
exam Arg-I
period Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
can Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
impact Arg-I
their Arg-I
grades Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
demerits Arg-B
of Arg-I
watching Arg-I
TV Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
merits Arg-I
and O
thus O
if Arg-B
students Arg-I
were Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
freely Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
proper Arg-I
controls Arg-I
by Arg-I
parents Arg-I
or Arg-I
teachers Arg-I

then Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
produce Arg-I
more Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Old O
and O
young O
workers O
Throughout O
human O
history O

, O
the O
offspring O
has O
always O
proved O
its O
stronger O
adaptability O
and O
advancement O
than O
its O
predecessor O
. O

This O
is O
still O
true O
in O
the O
industrial O
society O
nowadays O
, O
where O
younger O
workers O
are O
preferably O
employed O
and O
promoted O
rather O
than O
over-50 O
workers O
. O

There O
are O
three O
reasons O
that O
can O
explain O
their O
unresponsiveness O
to O
the O
modern O
workplace O
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
old Arg-B
workers Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
patch Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
younger Arg-I
ones Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
unchanged Arg-I
paradigm Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
old Arg-I
were Arg-I
raised Arg-I
in Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
, Arg-I
probably Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
war Arg-I
, Arg-I
look Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
and Arg-I
pessimistic Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
misery Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
ingrained Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
mind Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
refuse Arg-I
to Arg-I
change Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
more Arg-I
precisely Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
accept Arg-I
the Arg-I
existence Arg-I
of Arg-I
such Arg-I
modernity Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
most Arg-B
would Arg-I
rather Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
piece Arg-I
together Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
machine Arg-I
than Arg-I
have Arg-I
it Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
robot Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
disbelief Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
and Arg-I
safety Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
capability Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
their Arg-B
unresponsiveness Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
attributed Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
towards Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
that Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
deteriorating Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
enthusiasm Arg-I
comes Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
taste Arg-I
for Arg-I
monotony Arg-I
and Arg-I
safe Arg-I
ideology Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
all Arg-I
means Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
by Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
' Arg-I
adventurousness Arg-I
and Arg-I
bravery Arg-I
. O

Blatantly Arg-B
seen Arg-I
, Arg-I
success Arg-I
of Arg-I
most Arg-I
companies Arg-I
stems Arg-I
from Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
whose Arg-I
enterprising Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
that Arg-I
catch Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
is Arg-I
regarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
wind Arg-I
of Arg-I
refreshment Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
knowledge Arg-B
is Arg-I
worth Arg-I
mentioning Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
key Arg-I
factor Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
young Arg-I
workers Arg-I
outrank Arg-I
the Arg-I
elderly Arg-I
. O

Who Arg-B
would Arg-I
the Arg-I
employer Arg-I
choose Arg-I
, Arg-I
an Arg-I
old Arg-I
man Arg-I
with Arg-I
old Arg-I
- Arg-I
fashioned Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
young Arg-I
man Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
good Arg-I
at Arg-I
fundermentaly Arg-I
subject Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
knows Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
program Arg-I
or Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
speak Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
to Arg-I
undermine Arg-I
old Arg-I
workers Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
their Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
authority Arg-I
over Arg-I
such Arg-I
basically Arg-I
required Arg-I
fields Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
day Arg-I
and Arg-I
age Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
incompetence Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
modern Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
workers Arg-B
over Arg-I
50 Arg-I
have Arg-I
proven Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
subordinate Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
following Arg-I
generation Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
of Arg-I
great Arg-I
importance Arg-I
to Arg-I
remain Arg-I
the Arg-I
harmonious Arg-I
coexistence Arg-I
of Arg-I
both Arg-I
sides Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
smooth Arg-I
sailing Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

Machines O
- O
positive O
or O
negative O
for O
humans O
Advancements O
in O
technology O
have O
touched O
new O
heights O
in O
past O
few O
decades O
. O

This O
can O
be O
seen O
no O
where O
clearer O
than O
in O
increasing O
use O
of O
machines O
now O
a O
days O
. O

These O
machines O
reduce O
the O
physical O
work O
done O
by O
humans O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
this O
is O
a O
positive O
development O
while O
others O
believe O
it O
to O
be O
disadvantageous O
for O
humans O
. O

Both O
sides O
will O
be O
critiqued O
before O
a O
reasoned O
conclusion O
is O
reached O
. O

It O
is O
felt O
by O
many O
that O
the Arg-B
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
machines Arg-I
is Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
for Arg-I
health Arg-I
of Arg-I
humans Arg-I
since O
machines Arg-B
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
many Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
staircases Arg-I
are Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
by Arg-I
lifts Arg-I
now Arg-I
a Arg-I
days Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
opt Arg-I
for Arg-I
elevators Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
climbing Arg-I
one Arg-I
or Arg-I
two Arg-I
flight Arg-I
of Arg-I
stairs Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
confirmed Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
researches Arg-I
that Arg-I
daily Arg-I
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
elevators Arg-I
in Arg-I
workplaces Arg-I
promotes Arg-I
obesity Arg-I
. O

So O
this Arg-B
example Arg-I
clearly Arg-I
shows Arg-I
the Arg-I
linkage Arg-I
between Arg-I
using Arg-I
machines Arg-I
and Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
health Arg-I
effects Arg-I
. O

On O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
, O
many O
people O
believe O
that O
usage Arg-B
of Arg-I
machines Arg-I
makes Arg-I
work Arg-I
easier Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
is Arg-I
consumed Arg-I
for Arg-I
doing Arg-I
similar Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
the Arg-I
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
food Arg-I
processors Arg-I
in Arg-I
kitchens Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
work Arg-I
of Arg-I
chopping Arg-I
, Arg-I
blending Arg-I
, Arg-I
grating Arg-I
, Arg-I
kneading Arg-I
has Arg-I
become Arg-I
so Arg-I
easy Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
without Arg-I
this Arg-I
simple Arg-I
machine Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
homes Arg-I
. O

Thus O
it O
is O
very O
obvious O
that O
using Arg-B
machines Arg-I
makes Arg-I
daily Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
consuming Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
cumbersome Arg-I
. O

After O
analyzing O
these O
two O
points O
of O
view O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
using Arg-B
machines Arg-I
is Arg-I
advantageous Arg-I
as O
machines Arg-B
make Arg-I
work Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
smooth Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
health Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
back Arg-I
seat Arg-I
because O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
and Arg-I
stay Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
in O
coming O
time O
people O
will O
enjoy O
using O
more O
and O
more O
machines O
and O
will O
choose O
alternative O
ways O
to O
stay O
disease O
free O
. O

Way O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
traffic O
? O

Big O
cities O
nowadays O
can O
be O
described O
as O
melting O
pots O
. O

The O
problem O
off O
traffic O
overload O
, O
caused O
by O
overpopulation O
, O
has O
aroused O
interest O
of O
many O
city O
planners O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
only O
if O
the O
demand O
to O
go O
out O
on O
the O
street O
is O
cut O
down O
can O
we O
solve O
the O
seemingly O
insurmountable O
issue O
of O
traffic O
gridlock O
. O

However O
, O
I O
have O
to O
profoundly O
disagree O
for O
there O
are O
still O
two O
viable O
solutions O
besides O
besides O
this O
way O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
public Arg-B
transport Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
key Arg-I
factor Arg-I
to Arg-I
minimize Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
street Arg-I
. O

Buses Arg-B
and Arg-I
trains Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
phased Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
streets Arg-I
for Arg-I
quite Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
proven Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
candidates Arg-I
among Arg-I
all Arg-I
options Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
, O
a Arg-B
bus Arg-I
can Arg-I
carry Arg-I
no Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
30 Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
train Arg-I
can Arg-I
carry Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
nine Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
ten Arg-I
times Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
number Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
to Arg-I
mention Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
highway Arg-I
train Arg-I
is Arg-I
operated Arg-I
underground Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
leaves Arg-I
the Arg-I
street Arg-I
above Arg-I
with Arg-I
buses Arg-I
and Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
- Arg-I
based Arg-I
vehicles Arg-I
. O

Together O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
lessen Arg-I
the Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
image Arg-I
in Arg-I
most Arg-I
cities Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
rarely O
do O
we O
realize O
the O
helpful O
existence O
of O
urban O
areas O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
if Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
shopping Arg-I
malls Arg-I
or Arg-I
universities Arg-I
were Arg-I
relocated Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
commuter Arg-I
belt Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
street Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
les Arg-I
burstling Arg-I
and Arg-I
overly Arg-I
- Arg-I
teemed Arg-I
as Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
now Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
rule O
of O
thumb O
, O
huge Arg-B
centers Arg-I
of Arg-I
attention Arg-I
distributed Arg-I
equally Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
region Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
residential Arg-I
areas Arg-I
will Arg-I
come Arg-I
along Arg-I
thus Arg-I
exert Arg-I
less Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
city Arg-I
itself Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
absolved Arg-I
of Arg-I
enduring Arg-I
the Arg-I
influx Arg-I
of Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
unemployed Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
city Arg-B
planner Arg-I
can Arg-I
still Arg-I
opt Arg-I
for Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
personal Arg-I
vehicle Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
exploitation Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
suburb Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended O
to O
put O
forward O
such O
solution O
, O
especially O
in O
some O
developing O
countries O
like O
Vietnam O
or O
China O
, O
with O
the O
ever O
- O
growing O
demand O
for O
job O
or O
education O
. O

Effect O
of O
celebrities O
on O
youth O
Young O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O
are O
greatly O
influenced O
by O
media O
and O
celebrities O
. O

These O
celebrities O
are O
popular O
among O
younger O
generations O
because O
of O
their O
glamorous O
lifestyles O
. O

It O
is O
agreed O
that O
following Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
youth Arg-I
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
looking O
at O
how O
health O
and O
personality O
of O
young O
people O
is O
affected O
by O
following O
celebrities O
as O
their O
mentors O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
seen O
that O
following Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
blindly Arg-I
affects Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
of Arg-I
adolescents Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
indulge Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
drugs Arg-I
and Arg-I
start Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
survey Arg-I
carried Arg-I
out Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
that Arg-I
why Arg-I
did Arg-I
they Arg-I
start Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
around Arg-I
forty Arg-I
percent Arg-I
of Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
answered Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
like Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
screen Arg-I
actor Arg-I
while Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
cigarettes Arg-I
. O

This O
example O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
imitating Arg-B
celebrities Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
health Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
when Arg-B
youth Arg-I
follows Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
it Arg-I
affects Arg-I
personality Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Adolescents Arg-B
follow Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
the Arg-I
make Arg-I
up Arg-I
and Arg-I
attire Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
favorite Arg-I
stars Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
their Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
recently Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
poll Arg-I
conducted Arg-I
by Arg-I
an Arg-I
American Arg-I
magazine Arg-I
it Arg-I
was Arg-I
found Arg-I
that Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
complain Arg-I
that Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
use Arg-I
derogatory Arg-I
words Arg-I
and Arg-I
abusive Arg-I
language Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
and Arg-I
at Arg-I
schools Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
this O
example O
makes O
it O
obvious O
that O
these Arg-B
glamorous Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
poor Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
conduct Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Thus O
to O
conclude O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
when Arg-B
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
follow Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
affects Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
has Arg-I
an Arg-I
overall Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
personality Arg-I
and Arg-I
future Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
individual Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
it O
is O
recommended O
that O
young O
people O
should O
be O
educated O
not O
to O
follow O
these O
celebrities O
blindly O
, O
rather O
they O
should O
focus O
on O
their O
career O
so O
that O
they O
may O
hope O
for O
a O
bright O
future O
. O

The O
gender O
issue O
for O
getting O
education O
needs O
The O
gender O
issues O
have O
been O
already O
discussing O
for O
many O
years O
in O
order O
to O
give O
solutions O
for O
realising O
the O
equal O
proportion O
of O
developing O
human O
resources O
. O

Implementing O
the O
statue O
and O
right O
of O
equal O
education O
are O
believed O
as O
a O
sustainable O
policy O
that O
should O
be O
held O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
institutions Arg-I
that Arg-I
accept Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
average Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
male Arg-I
and Arg-I
female Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

I O
strongly O
agree O
about O
this O
statement O
. O

The Arg-B
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
women Arg-I
is Arg-I
rising Arg-I
year Arg-I
by Arg-I
year Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
recently Arg-I
. O

Automatically O
, O
the Arg-B
issue Arg-I
stimulates Arg-I
the Arg-I
stakeholders Arg-I
from Arg-I
many Arg-I
places Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
what Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
preparations Arg-I
they Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
for Arg-I
stabilising Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

We O
can O
see O
now O
that O
women Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
fields Arg-I
which Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
normally Arg-I
done Arg-I
by Arg-I
men Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
being Arg-I
engineers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
dealing Arg-I
with Arg-I
machines Arg-I
. O

Those O
activities O
have O
proven O
that O
women Arg-B
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
men Arg-I
's Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
female Arg-B
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
indicated Arg-I
having Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
potential Arg-I
and Arg-I
capability Arg-I
as Arg-I
men Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
order O
to O
gaining O
higher O
education O
degree O
as O
it O
is O
required O
to O
establish O
a O
person O
's O
career O
. O

These Arg-B
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
hard Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
proper Arg-I
job Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
not Arg-I
degree Arg-I
certificate Arg-I
from Arg-I
Universities Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
learning Arg-B
from Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
history Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
provides Arg-I
someone Arg-I
to Arg-I
widen Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
for Arg-I
facing Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
situation Arg-I
of Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
through Arg-I
subject Arg-I
taught Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
. O

According O
to O
this O
opinion O
, O
giving Arg-B
equal Arg-I
education Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
men Arg-I
and Arg-I
women Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
must Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
needs Arg-I
for Arg-I
having Arg-I
developed Arg-I
- Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
degree Arg-I
certificate Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
someone Arg-I
's Arg-I
career Arg-I
are Arg-I
totally Arg-I
needed Arg-I
to Arg-I
implement Arg-I
and Arg-I
applied Arg-I
for Arg-I
any Arg-I
gender Arg-I
. O

As O
the O
world O
's O
situation O
is O
always O
changing O
, O
act Arg-B
for Arg-I
distributing Arg-I
education Arg-I
needs Arg-I
are Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
compete Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
. O

Smoking O
should O
be O
made O
prohibited O
in O
public O
places O
People O
the O
world O
over O
have O
designated O
smoothing O
as O
a O
shameful O
practice O
and O
a O
lethal O
habit O
. O

Several O
millions O
of O
smokers O
die O
suffering O
from O
cancers O
such O
as O
lung O
and O
oral O
. O

This O
bad O
habit O
also O
responsible O
for O
causing O
health O
hazards O
to O
passive O
- O
smokers O
: O
who O
are O
around O
smoking O
is O
taken O
place O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
argued O
that O
smoking Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
prohibited Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
bus Arg-I
and Arg-I
railway Arg-I
stations Arg-I
. O

This O
position O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
looking O
at O
how O
this O
arrangement O
has O
benefited O
both O
general O
public O
as O
well O
as O
smokers O
. O

To O
start O
, O
non Arg-B
- Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
public Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
undoubtedly Arg-I
benefited Arg-I
by Arg-I
enforcing Arg-I
such Arg-I
restrain Arg-I
. O

Prior Arg-B
to Arg-I
1980 Arg-I
's Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
Sri Arg-I
Lanka Arg-I
, Arg-I
illustrates Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
situation Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
smoked Arg-I
freely Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
they Arg-I
engaged Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
intolerant Arg-I
bad Arg-I
habit Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
instances Arg-I
that Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
belligerent Arg-I
incidents Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
enforcing Arg-I
restrictions Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
came Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
act Arg-I
as Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
rendered Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
introducing Arg-B
smoking Arg-I
ban Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
places Arg-I
would Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
discourage Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
engaging Arg-I
tobacco Arg-I
puffing Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
further Arg-B
enforcement Arg-I
banned Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
in Arg-I
capital Arg-I
in Arg-I
Sri Arg-I
Lanka Arg-I
has Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
this Arg-I
consumption Arg-I
related Arg-I
diseases Arg-I
and Arg-I
deaths Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
per Arg-I
the Arg-I
ministry Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

As O
this O
shows O
, O
smoking Arg-B
restrictions Arg-I
has Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
daunted Arg-I
public Arg-I
from Arg-I
this Arg-I
bad Arg-I
puffing Arg-I
that Arg-I
put Arg-I
less Arg-I
strain Arg-I
on Arg-I
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
systems Arg-I
. O

After O
analyzing O
smoke O
illegalization O
in O
public O
places O
in O
Sri O
Lanka O
, O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
proven Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
people Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
this Arg-I
arrangement Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
thus O
hoped O
governments O
would O
consider O
smoke O
banning O
in O
public O
places O
following O
footsteps O
of O
Sri O
Lanka O
as O
well O
as O
many O
other O
countries O
. O

Tourism O
: O
good O
or O
bad O
? O

Tourism O
, O
since O
its O
first O
appearance O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
can O
be O
described O
as O
a O
controversial O
celebrity O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
tourism O
is O
attributed O
to O
domestic O
economic O
distortion O
, O
environmental O
devastation O
and O
irrepairable O
damage O
to O
the O
exploited O
places O
. O

However O
, O
I O
strongly O
disagree O
with O
this O
misconcept O
for O
the O
two O
following O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
tourism Arg-B
plays Arg-I
an Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
nurturing Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
meant Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

Basically O
, O
places Arg-B
of Arg-I
interest Arg-I
often Arg-I
locate Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
wilderness Arg-I
areas Arg-I
, Arg-I
of Arg-I
which Arg-I
economy Arg-I
, Arg-I
before Arg-I
their Arg-I
appearance Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
n't Arg-I
blossmed Arg-I
yet Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
until Arg-I
the Arg-I
investment Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
companies Arg-I
do Arg-I
chains Arg-I
of Arg-I
hotels Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
spring Arg-I
up Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
all Arg-I
means Arg-I
, Arg-I
attract Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
attention Arg-I
which Arg-I
goes Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
hand Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
income Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
residents Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
word O
, O
tourism Arg-B
helps Arg-I
divert Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
economy Arg-I
to Arg-I
its Arg-I
right Arg-I
direction Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
exploit Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
potential Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
even O
though O
environmental Arg-B
damage Arg-I
is Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
blamed Arg-I
for Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
turn Arg-I
a Arg-I
wilderness Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
of Arg-I
attraction Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
planners Arg-I
must Arg-I
have Arg-I
taken Arg-I
the Arg-I
nourishment Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
sceneries Arg-I
into Arg-I
thorough Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
fortune Arg-I
is Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
trimming Arg-I
the Arg-I
trees Arg-I
, Arg-I
watering Arg-I
the Arg-I
flowers Arg-I
, Arg-I
preserving Arg-I
and Arg-I
balancing Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
fauna Arg-I
and Arg-I
flora Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
hope Arg-I
of Arg-I
beautifying Arg-I
the Arg-I
wild Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
to Arg-I
mention Arg-I
ecotourism Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
environment Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
service Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
gives Arg-I
all Arg-I
environmentalists Arg-I
and Arg-I
nature Arg-I
lovers Arg-I
a Arg-I
hand Arg-I
in Arg-I
raising Arg-I
the Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
protecting Arg-I
their Arg-I
coexistent Arg-I
creatures Arg-I
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
tourism Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
alledged Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
notorous Arg-I
for Arg-I
its Arg-I
detriment Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
ecological Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
. O

All O
thing O
considered O
, O
tourism Arg-B
has Arg-I
proven Arg-I
its Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
towards Arg-I
the Arg-I
exploited Arg-I
areas Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
finance Arg-I
and Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
impact Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B
combination Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
and Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
process Arg-I
is Arg-I
highly Arg-I
recommended Arg-I
in Arg-I
pursuit Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
harmonial Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
between Arg-I
human Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
surroundings Arg-I
. O

Future O
information O
technology O
: O
positive O
or O
negative O
? O

The O
appearance O
of O
information O
technology O
( O
IT O
) O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
years O
has O
brought O
about O
significant O
developments O
in O
life O
standard O
as O
well O
as O
work O
efficiency O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
evolution O
also O
proves O
to O
be O
detrimental O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
is O
a O
likelihood O
that O
future Arg-B
developments Arg-I
in Arg-I
IT Arg-I
will Arg-I
put Arg-I
the Arg-I
users Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
expense Arg-I
. O

With O
the O
rapid O
developing O
pace O
, O
IT Arg-B
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
turned Arg-I
its Arg-I

In Arg-B
the Arg-I

Such Arg-B

people Arg-I
from Arg-I

the Arg-B

The Arg-B

conclusion O

Vegetarianism O
- O
why O
some O
people O
are O
choosing O
to O
become O
vegetarian O
? O

Since O
the O
dawn O
of O
time O
, O
human O
has O
considered O
meat O
as O
a O
fundamental O
protein O
sources O
. O

Meat O
has O
served O
as O
the O
main O
dish O
in O
almost O
every O
family O
's O
meals O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Recent O
years O
, O
however O
, O
has O
seen O
a O
rapid O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
vegetarians O
. O

Some O
people O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
care O
for O
animal O
rights O
issue O
, O
others O
think O
it O
is O
much O
beyond O
that O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
people Arg-B
avoid Arg-I
eating Arg-I
meat Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
sake Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
relegious Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
health Arg-B
improvement Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
vegetarian Arg-I
diet Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
so Arg-I
popular Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
researchers Arg-I
have Arg-I
convinced Arg-I
that Arg-I
many Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
vegetable Arg-I
contain Arg-I
antioxydant Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
cancer Arg-I
. O

This O
fortifies O
the O
fact O
that O
a Arg-B
vegetable Arg-I
diet Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
our Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Although O
some O
argue O
that O
a Arg-B
meal Arg-I
without Arg-I
meat Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
protein Arg-I
intake Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
proved Arg-I
that Arg-I
many Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
bean Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
soy Arg-I
bean Arg-I
or Arg-I
pea Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
comparable Arg-I
protein Arg-I
sources Arg-I
. O

Secondy O
, O
relegious O
beliefs O
also O
contributes O
to O
a O
vegetarian O
diet O
. O

Some Arg-B
religion Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Buddha Arg-I
, Arg-I
believes Arg-I
that Arg-I
animals Arg-I
were Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
previous Arg-I
life Arg-I
, O
so O
eating Arg-B
their Arg-I
meat Arg-I

mean Arg-I
you Arg-I
eat Arg-I
the Arg-I
flesh Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
parent Arg-I
sentient Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
this O
view O
is O
rather O
unscientific O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
vital Arg-I
to Arg-I
follow Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
own Arg-I
religious Arg-I
practices Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
the Arg-I
enlightenment Arg-I
in Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
it O
is O
evident O
for O
me O
that O
people Arg-B
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
vegetarians Arg-I
for Arg-I
health Arg-I
and Arg-I
religious Arg-I
concern Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
a O
meal O
which O
is O
nutritionally O
balanced O
is O
always O
most O
recommended O
. O

The O
maintenance O
of O
traditional O
skills O
and O
ways O
of O
life O
? O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O

the O
application O
of O
technological O
developments O
in O
some O
countries O
will O
be O
accompanied O
with O
modern O
skills O
and O
new O
lifestyles O
. O

It O
is O
argued O
that O
these O
so O
- O
called O
cultural O
invasions O
will O
result O
in O
the O
distinction O
of O
national O
traditions O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
maintain O
them O
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
what Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
expected Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
change Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
but Arg-I
not Arg-I
its Arg-I
disappearance Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the Arg-B
country Arg-I
's Arg-I
culture Arg-I
is Arg-I
passed Arg-I
down Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
through Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
Vietnam Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
water Arg-I
puppet Arg-I
shows Arg-I
which Arg-I
once Arg-I
demonstrated Arg-I
our Arg-I
seasonal Arg-I
agriculture Arg-I
and Arg-I
communal Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
today Arg-I
substituted Arg-I
by Arg-I
cinemas Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
concerts Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
the Arg-B
young Arg-I
generation Arg-I
can Arg-I
solely Arg-I
get Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
ancestor Arg-I
's Arg-I
early Arg-I
life Arg-I
through Arg-I
books Arg-I
and Arg-I
images Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
easily Arg-I
absorbed Arg-I
. O

In O
tradition O
, O
a Arg-B
person Arg-I
should Arg-I
look Arg-I
back Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
by Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
custom Arg-I
handcraft Arg-I
or Arg-I
antique Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
progress Arg-I
. O

Understanding Arg-B
why Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
our Arg-I
predecessors Arg-I
survived Arg-I
through Arg-I
thick Arg-I
and Arg-I
thin Arg-I
will Arg-I
probably Arg-I
be Arg-I
invaluable Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
study Arg-B
form Arg-I
their Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
accomplish Arg-I
our Arg-I
goal Arg-I
with Arg-I
smooth Arg-I
sailing Arg-I
. O

To O
sumarize O
, O
there Arg-B
should Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
any Arg-I
replacement Arg-I
for Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
or Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
ones Arg-I
that Arg-I
teach Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
esteem Arg-I
and Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
means Arg-I
their Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
history Arg-I
deserve Arg-I
our Arg-I
attention Arg-I
. O

The O
zoo O
deserves O
maintenance O
and O
public O
respect O
For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
zoo O
has O
been O
a O
second O
home O
to O
endangered O
animals O
. O

However O
, O
other O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
existence O
of O
zoos O
is O
next O
to O
nothing O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
deserves Arg-I
maintenance Arg-I
and Arg-I
public Arg-I
respect Arg-I
for O
two O
specific O
reasons O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
with Arg-I
regard Arg-I
to Arg-I
providing Arg-I
real Arg-I
and Arg-I
vivid Arg-I
materials Arg-I
for Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
, Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
observing Arg-I
the Arg-I
habit Arg-I
and Arg-I
unique Arg-I
instinct Arg-I
of Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
lion Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
crocodile Arg-I
. O

At O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
biological Arg-I
research Arg-I
based Arg-I
on Arg-I
practical Arg-I
statistics Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
recordings Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
at Arg-I
hand Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
zoos Arg-B
conduce Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
acquisition Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
at Arg-I
various Arg-I
levels Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
also Arg-I
serve Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
ecological Arg-I
protection Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
globalisation Arg-I
is Arg-I
accompanied Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
encroachment Arg-I
upon Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
consequently Arg-I
calls Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
the Arg-B
ever Arg-I
- Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
huntings Arg-I
are Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
toll Arg-I
on Arg-I
rare Arg-I
and Arg-I
specious Arg-I
species Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
when Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
appear Arg-I
are Arg-I
such Arg-I
distinction Arg-I
- Arg-I
driven Arg-I
animals Arg-I
as Arg-I
: Arg-I
giraffe Arg-I
, Arg-I
panda Arg-I
, Arg-I
koala Arg-I
or Arg-I
leopard Arg-I
provided Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
inaccessible Arg-I
territory Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
the Arg-B
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
towards Arg-I
both Arg-I
human Arg-I
and Arg-I
animals Arg-I
is Arg-I
undeniably Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended O
that O
zoos O
should O
be O
seen O
with O
different O
perspective O
in O
order O
to O
function O
at O
their O
most O
efficiency O
. O

Languages O
' O
extinction O
, O
discuss O
both O
views O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
increasing O
number O
of O
languages O
which O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
extinction O
has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
issues O
that O
many O
people O
of O
today O
's O
society O
are O
very O
concerned O
for O
. O

The O
question O
whether O
our O
government O
should O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
preserve O
them O
by O
investing O
more O
money O
on O
that O
minority O
languages O
or O
not O
is O
still O
a O
debatable O
one O
. O

I O
personally O
suppose O
that O
no Arg-B
matter Arg-I
how Arg-I
widely Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
, Arg-I
every Arg-I
language Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
protected Arg-I
from Arg-I
being Arg-I
disappeared Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
saving Arg-B
regional Arg-I
languages Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
that Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
expands Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
scope Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
languages Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
really Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
because O
educational Arg-B
programmes Arg-I
will Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
learning Arg-I
and Arg-I
using Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
some Arg-B
certain Arg-I
areas Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
Southern Arg-I
Vietnam Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
secondary Arg-I
school Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
originally Arg-I
from Arg-I
khmer Arg-I
people Arg-I
speak Arg-I
their Arg-I
language Arg-I
beside Arg-I
Vietnamese Arg-I
, O
so O
the Arg-B
local Arg-I
government Arg-I
has Arg-I
recently Arg-I
struggled Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
costly Arg-I
investments Arg-I
on Arg-I
language Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
materials Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
in Arg-B
many Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
trade Arg-I
, Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
transaction Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
society Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
together Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
language Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

Despite O
of O
the O
above O
arguments O
, O
i O
still O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
minority Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
language Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
just Arg-I
one Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
forming Arg-B
a Arg-I
language Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
undergone Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
years Arg-I
; O
thus O
, O
it Arg-B
deserves Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
respected Arg-I
and Arg-I
preserved Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
language Arg-B
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
essential Arg-I
factors Arg-I
creating Arg-I
the Arg-I
differences Arg-I
and Arg-I
unique Arg-I
cutures Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
saving Arg-B
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
languages Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
generally Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
element Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
's Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
although O
letting Arg-B
languages Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
by Arg-I
ethnic Arg-I
minorities Arg-I
be Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
impact Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
on Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
loss Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
heritages Arg-I
. O

Prevention O
is O
better O
than O

There O
has O
always O
been O
a O
saying O
in O
medicine O
: O

" O
Prevention O
is O
better O
than O
cure O
" O
. O

This O
statement O
has O
raised O
a O
question O
whether O
the O
government O
should O
allocate O
a O
large O
sum O
out O
of O
the O
national O
health O
budget O
to O
educating O
and O
phasing O
in O
health O
- O
protected O
measures O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this Arg-B
plan Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
into Arg-I
practice Arg-I
for O
the O
two O
reasons O
mentioned O
accordingly O
. O

No Arg-B
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
argue Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
to Arg-I
include Arg-I
health Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
programmes Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
at Arg-I
primary Arg-I
level Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
hope Arg-I
of Arg-I
raising Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
taught Arg-I
about Arg-I
balanced Arg-I
diets Arg-I
, Arg-I
nutritious Arg-I
food Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
ones Arg-I
, O
thereby O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
grasp Arg-I
of Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I

a O

It O

the O
importance O
of O

a O

whether O

outstanding Arg-B

such Arg-B

Besides O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
one Arg-B

what Arg-I
he Arg-I

done Arg-I

University Arg-B
is Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
gift Arg-I

those Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
gone Arg-I
to Arg-I
great Arg-I

However O
, O
university Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
just Arg-I
about Arg-I
academic Arg-I

also Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
artistic Arg-I
talent Arg-I
and Arg-I
develop Arg-I
soft Arg-I
skills Arg-I

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
up Arg-I

for Arg-I
a Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I

What O
is O
more O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
tendency Arg-I

social Arg-I

rise Arg-I
if Arg-I

In O
conclusion O
, O
university Arg-B
restriction Arg-I
has Arg-I
both Arg-I
pros Arg-I
and Arg-I
cons Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
yield Arg-I
more Arg-I
negative Arg-I
results Arg-I
than Arg-I
positive Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

That O

why O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
made Arg-I
available Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
learners Arg-I
. O

Teacher O
is O
the O
best O
option O
for O
children O

in O
some O
aspects O

Recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
with O
regard O
to O
who O
is O
the O
best O
teacher O
for O
children O
's O
education O
. O

Indeed O
, O
children O
grow O
up O
with O
two O
important O
people O
, O
their O
parents O
and O
teachers O
, O
and O
both O
are O
important O
in O
children O
's O
development O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the Arg-B
teacher Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
option Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
education Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
school Arg-B
teachers Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
than Arg-I
parents Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
to Arg-B
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
the Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
certificates Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
need Arg-I
years Arg-I
of Arg-I
training Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
normal Arg-I
schools Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
theoretical Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in Arg-B
comparison Arg-I
to Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
less Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
mathematics Arg-I
and Arg-I
physics Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
teaching Arg-B
staff Arg-I
are Arg-I
professional Arg-I
and Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
communication Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
after Arg-B
many Arg-I
years Arg-I
of Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
important Arg-I
life Arg-I
skills Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
learning Arg-I
personal Arg-I
boundaries Arg-I
, Arg-I
facing Arg-I
future Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
important Arg-I
conflict Arg-I
resolution Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
generation Arg-I
gap Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
because Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
less Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
handle Arg-I
family Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
compared Arg-B
with Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
parents Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
facing Arg-I
a Arg-I
global Arg-I
economic Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
parents Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
, O
hence O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
only Arg-I
limited Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it Arg-B
was Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
teachers Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
do Arg-I
they Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
much Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
important Arg-I
social Arg-I
communication Arg-I
techniques Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
survive Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Salary O
is O
the O
most O
important O
consideration O
when O
choosing O
a O
job O
Along O
with O
the O
increasing O
physical O
demands O
of O
human O
life O
, O
salary O
has O
become O
the O
most O
influential O
consideration O
in O
defining O
careers O
of O
everyone O
. O

I O
personally O
suppose O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
important Arg-I
as Arg-I
income Arg-I
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
, O
some O
of O
my O
viewpoints O
would O
be O
given O
and O
analyzed O
respectively O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
i O
agree O
that O
money Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
essential Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
human Arg-I
' Arg-I
basic Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

More O
specifically O
, O
people Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
high Arg-I
salary Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
help Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
support Arg-I
partially Arg-I
or Arg-I
wholly Arg-I
their Arg-I
family Arg-I
's Arg-I
living Arg-I
needs Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
food Arg-I
, Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
, Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
medication Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
woking Arg-I
in Arg-I
art Arg-I
or Arg-I
painting Arg-I
industries Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
quite Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
comfortably Arg-I
and Arg-I
enjoyably Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
doing Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
love Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
income Arg-I
however Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
quite Arg-I
low Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
career Arg-I
paths Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
i O
believe O
that O
if Arg-B
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
passionate Arg-I
about Arg-I
what Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
success Arg-I
easily Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
really Arg-I
successful Arg-I
, Arg-I
have Arg-I
started Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
challenging Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
fields Arg-I
as Arg-I
singers Arg-I
, Arg-I
dancers Arg-I
and Arg-I
painters Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
important Arg-B
factors Arg-I
in Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
, Arg-I
satisfaction Arg-I
of Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
personal Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
, Arg-I
professional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
working Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
managers Arg-I
and Arg-I
colleagues Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
underestimated Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
career Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
desire Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
others Arg-I
and Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
positively Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
countries Arg-I
and Arg-I
societies Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
income Arg-B
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
a Arg-I
vital Arg-I
determination Arg-I
impacting Arg-I
us Arg-I
on Arg-I
choices Arg-I
of Arg-I
careers Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
passion Arg-B
on Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
actual Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
get Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
in Arg-I
working Arg-I
to Arg-I
earn Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
later Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

Increased O
taxation O
on O
petrol O
and O
diesel O
fuel O
to O
discourage O
private O
cars O
? O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O

our O
life O
has O
had O
a O
change O
for O
the O
better O
since O
cars O
were O
introduced O
. O

However O
, O
cars O
themselves O
, O
especially O
private O
ones O
, O
have O
exerted O
severe O
pressure O
on O
the O
environment O
and O
economy O
for O
wasteful O
oil O
consumption O
. O

While Arg-B
many Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
petrol Arg-I
and Arg-I
diesel Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
charged Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
highest Arg-I
taxation Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
this Arg-I
notion Arg-I
. O

One O
can O
not O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
if Arg-B
petrol Arg-I
and Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
taxation Arg-I
are Arg-I
raised Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
might Arg-I
hesitate Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
. O

Taxation Arg-B
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
tackled Arg-I
the Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
issue Arg-I
simply Arg-I
by Arg-I
diverting Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportations Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
trains Arg-I
, Arg-I
buses Arg-I
or Arg-I
ferries Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
for Arg-B
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
already Arg-I
afforded Arg-I
a Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
likelihood Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
restraint Arg-I
from Arg-I
usage Arg-I
on Arg-I
long Arg-I
journeys Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
taxation Arg-B
on Arg-I
flamable Arg-I
resources Arg-I
might Arg-I
backfire Arg-I
by Arg-I
conducing Arg-I
to Arg-I
inflation Arg-I
. O

To O
be O
precise O
, O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
costly Arg-I
petrol Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
higher Arg-I
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
product Arg-I
: Arg-I
rice Arg-I
, Arg-I
meat Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
vegetable Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
people Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
turn Arg-I
to Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
alternatives Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
might Arg-I
cause Arg-I
the Arg-I
abundance Arg-I
in Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
later Arg-I
on Arg-I
, Arg-I
economic Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
. O

Another O
point O
that O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
is O
countries Arg-B
that Arg-I
import Arg-I
oil Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
dependent Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
exporters Arg-I
, Arg-I
both Arg-I
politically Arg-I
and Arg-I
financially Arg-I
. O

Suppose Arg-B
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
those Arg-I
countries Arg-I
cut Arg-I
down Arg-I
on Arg-I
its Arg-I
oil Arg-I
support Arg-I
, Arg-I
other Arg-I
nations Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
release Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
policies Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

America Arg-B
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
has Arg-I
recently Arg-I
drawn Arg-I
its Arg-I
intervention Arg-I
in Arg-I
Russian Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
only Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
influx Arg-I
of Arg-I
oil Arg-I
. O

To O
summarize O
, O
higher Arg-B
fuel Arg-I
and Arg-I
petrol Arg-I
cost Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
pros Arg-I
and Arg-I
cons Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
disadvantages Arg-I
may Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
with Arg-I
regard Arg-I
to Arg-I
economic Arg-I
and Arg-I
politic Arg-I
issues Arg-I
, Arg-I
making Arg-I
it Arg-I
advisable Arg-I
to Arg-I
seek Arg-I

that O
many O
people O
of O
today O
's O
society O
are O
very O
concerned O
for O
. O

Few O
individuals O
assume O
that O
this Arg-B
trend Arg-I
reflects Arg-I
and Arg-I
enhances Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

I O
totally O
agree O
with O
this O
viewpoint O
for O
some O
specific O
reasons O
which O
would O
be O
given O
and O
analyzed O
in O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
that Arg-I
police Arg-I
armed Arg-I
with Arg-I
guns Arg-I
or Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
legal Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
just Arg-I
attempts Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
civilians Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
criminals Arg-B
todays Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
sophisticated Arg-I
so Arg-I
they Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
modern Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
to Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
and Arg-I
serve Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
nefarious Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
citizens Arg-B
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
society Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
shot Arg-I
by Arg-I
both Arg-I
police Arg-I
and Arg-I
offenders Arg-I
accidentally Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
while Arg-B
on Arg-I
duty Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
are Arg-I
private Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
affected Arg-I
but Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I
houses Arg-I
, Arg-I
streets Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
by Arg-I
guns Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
society Arg-I
that Arg-I
its Arg-I
police Arg-I
force Arg-I
carries Arg-I
guns Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
highly Arg-I
violent Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
police Arg-B
force Arg-I
carries Arg-I
guns Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
crime Arg-I
societies Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
people Arg-B
and Arg-I
police Arg-I
in Arg-I
those Arg-I
ones Arg-I
usually Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
dangerous Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
crime Arg-I
's Arg-I
categories Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
theft Arg-I
, Arg-I
robbery Arg-I
, Arg-I
murder Arg-I
, Arg-I
rape Arg-I
, Arg-I
vandalism Arg-I
, Arg-I
arson Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
Those Arg-B
are Arg-I
possibly Arg-I
the Arg-I
strongest Arg-I
evidences Arg-I
to Arg-I
determine Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
from O
the O
above O
views O
, O
although O
being Arg-B
armed Arg-I
with Arg-I
guns Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
force Arg-I
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
bring Arg-I
the Arg-I
higher Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
government O
should O
to O
impose O
strict O
laws O
in O
carrying O
weapons O
as O
well O
as O
give O
professional O
training O
to O
them O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
any O
influence O
on O
civilians O
' O
lives O
. O

Negative O
effects O
of O
technological O
process O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
technological O
process O
has O
brought O
numerous O
benefits O
making O
human O
life O
become O
more O
and O
more O
comfortable O
and O
easy O
. O

Some O
individuals O
assume O
that O
this O
technological O
development O
also O
causes O
many O
drawbacks O
impacting O
seriously O
on O
our O
lives O
. O

I O
personally O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

In O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
, O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
above O
matter O
as O
well O
as O
my O
own O
view O
's O
explanations O
would O
be O
analyzed O
and O
given O
, O
respectively O
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
that O
thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
invented Arg-I
recently Arg-I
, Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
improved Arg-I
dramatically Arg-I
. O

Air Arg-B
- Arg-I
conditioners Arg-I
, Arg-I
computers Arg-I
, Arg-I
cellphones Arg-I
, Arg-I
washing Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
helping Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
stress Arg-I
and Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
applying Arg-B
technological Arg-I
science Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
of Arg-I
medications Arg-I
also Arg-I
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
saving Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
' Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
some O
negative O
aspects O
of O
technological O
process O
need O
to O
be O
mentioned O
clearly O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
bring O
fantastic O
advantages O
, O
technological Arg-B
products Arg-I
have Arg-I
devastated Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environment Arg-I
indirectly Arg-I
through Arg-I
its Arg-I
production Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
exploiting Arg-B
and Arg-I
collecting Arg-I
raw Arg-I
materials Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
essential Arg-I
fuels Arg-I
to Arg-I
serve Arg-I
the Arg-I
production Arg-I
of Arg-I
technological Arg-I
products Arg-I
have Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
nature Arg-I
seriously Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
in Arg-I
certain Arg-I
groups Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
especially Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
youth Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
dependence Arg-I
upon Arg-I
available Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
totally O
believe O
that O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
and Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
neglect Arg-I
profound Arg-I
impact Arg-I
of Arg-I
great Arg-I
technological Arg-I
process Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
its O
adverse O
effects O
need O
controlling O
more O
reasonably O
. O

Large O
amount O
of O
violence O
in O
television O
programs O
Excessive O
violence O
in O
television O
programs O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
major O
concerns O
facing O
society O
. O

Reducing O
such O
contents O
from O
TV O
shows O
is O
the O
widely O
accepted O
solution O
endorsed O
by O
the O
majority O
of O
governments O
throughout O
the O
world O
today O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
violent Arg-I
components Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
minimum Arg-I
in Arg-I
kidvids Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
such Arg-I
contents Arg-I
remain Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
TV Arg-I
shows Arg-I
that Arg-I
for Arg-I
mature Arg-I
minds Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
entirely Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
reducing Arg-B
the Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
violent Arg-I
content Arg-I
in Arg-I
TV Arg-I
shows Arg-I
could Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
degree Arg-I
, Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
overall Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in O
order O
to O
tackle O
this O
problem O
more O
effectively O
, O
governments Arg-B
must Arg-I
first Arg-I
prohibit Arg-I
any Arg-I
types Arg-I
of Arg-I
violent Arg-I
content Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
children Arg-I
’s Arg-I
television Arg-I
programs Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
mental Arg-I
immaturity Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
are Arg-I
incapable Arg-I
of Arg-I
distinguishing Arg-I
right Arg-I
from Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
. O

Little O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
by Arg-B
watching Arg-I
these Arg-I
violent Arg-I
TV Arg-I
programs Arg-I
and Arg-I
videos Arg-I
, Arg-I
juveniles Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
very Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
and Arg-I
offensive Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
tendency Arg-I
to Arg-I
commit Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
rather Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
governments Arg-I
to Arg-I
establish Arg-I
an Arg-I
intensive Arg-I
law Arg-I
that Arg-I
prevents Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
from Arg-I
watching Arg-I
these Arg-I
violent Arg-I
and Arg-I
brutal Arg-I
TV Arg-I
Shows Arg-I
and Arg-I
movies Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
violation Arg-I
of Arg-I
adults Arg-I
’ Arg-I
civil Arg-I
liberties Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
governments Arg-I
implement Arg-I
such Arg-I
a Arg-I
restricted Arg-I
regulation Arg-I
on Arg-I
these Arg-I
TV Arg-I
shows Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
that Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
mature Arg-I
audiences Arg-I
. O

Frequently O
, O
adults Arg-B
watch Arg-I
horror Arg-I
video Arg-I
or Arg-I
war Arg-I
movies Arg-I
for Arg-I
relaxing Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
after Arg-I
a Arg-I
busy Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
whom Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
media Arg-I
sources Arg-I
are Arg-I
mere Arg-I
materials Arg-I
of Arg-I
relaxation Arg-I
and Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
. O

Considering Arg-B
that Arg-I
these Arg-I
mature Arg-I
minds Arg-I
are Arg-I
capable Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
shows Arg-I
or Arg-I
movies Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
appealing Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
violent Arg-B
contents Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
excluded Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
kidvids Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
juvenile Arg-I
delinquency Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
the O
adults O
should O
not O
be O
the O
victim O
of O
this O
policy O
. O

Do O
guns O
can O
really O
increase O
the O
level O
of O
violence O
? O

The O
number O
of O
criminality O
is O
increase O
rapidly O
throughout O
the O
world O
. O

Some O
inhabitants O
argue O
that O
this O
case O
appears O
because O
the O
guns O
are O
always O
used O
by O
a O
police O
to O
solve O
a O
criminal O
act O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
disagree O
with O
this O
statement O
, O
while O
I O
believe O
that O
other O
factors O
contribute O
a O
slight O
incline O
level O
of O
violence O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
a Arg-B
police Arg-I
holds Arg-I
a Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
urban Arg-I
or Arg-I
suburban Arg-I
areas Arg-I
using Arg-I
a Arg-I
gun Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
obvious Arg-I
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
happens Arg-I
in Arg-I
The Arg-I
United Arg-I
State Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
killed Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
ten Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cinema Arg-I
using Arg-I
a Arg-I
weapon Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
police Arg-I
shot Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
foot Arg-I
to Arg-I
paralyze Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
police Arg-B
officers Arg-I
can Arg-I
force Arg-I
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
to Arg-I
surrender Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
weapon Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
an Arg-I
escaping Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
who Arg-I
poses Arg-I
a Arg-I
serious Arg-I
danger Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
some Arg-B
military Arg-I
weapons Arg-I
need Arg-I
encouraging Arg-I
for Arg-I
police Arg-I
officers Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
and Arg-I
minimize Arg-I
the Arg-I
rate Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
some Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
the Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
bloody Arg-I
increases Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
communities Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
the Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
unemployment Arg-I
rate Arg-I
has Arg-I
risen Arg-I
to Arg-I
15 Arg-I
percent Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
globalized Arg-I
and Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
globalized Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
qualified Arg-I
and Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
educated Arg-I
person Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
earn Arg-I
some Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
comfortably Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
cost Arg-B
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
extremely Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
this Arg-I
problem Arg-I
impresses Arg-I
some Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
under Arg-I
the Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
line Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
anything Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
their Arg-I
basic Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
baggers Arg-I
chose Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
pickpocket Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
transport Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the Arg-B
guns Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
by Arg-I
police Arg-I
have Arg-I
not Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
trigger Arg-I
of Arg-I
higher Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
some O
cases O
occupy O
a O
crucial O
reason O
to O
do O
a O
criminality O
in O
society O
such O
unemployment O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
is O
decreasing O
a O
level O
of O
unemployment O
to O
avoid O
a O
criminal O
act O
. O

Life O
in O
Big O
Cities O

Vs O
People O
's O
health O
Today O
, O
more O
and O
more O
people O
are O
moving O
to O
big O
cities O
to O
live O
. O

However O
, O
while O
life Arg-B
in Arg-I
those Arg-I
cities Arg-I
is Arg-I
good Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
ways Arg-I
, O
I O
completely O
argue O
that O
people Arg-B
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
would Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
be Arg-I
affected Arg-I
negatively Arg-I
. O

Environment Arg-B
pollution Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
primary Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
why Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
is Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
worse Arg-I
than Arg-I
ever Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

Exhaust Arg-B
from Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
factories Arg-I
' Arg-I
tosix Arg-I
fumes Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
with Arg-I
various Arg-I
respiratory Arg-I
deseases Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
water Arg-B
pollution Arg-I
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
critical Arg-I
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
dangerous Arg-B
bacterias Arg-I
and Arg-I
germs Arg-I
in Arg-I
polluted Arg-I
water Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
indirectly Arg-I
into Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
bodies Arg-I
and Arg-I
create Arg-I
severe Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
death Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
patients Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
treated Arg-I
in Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
likely Arg-I
that Arg-I
many Arg-I
foods Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
safe Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
eat Arg-I
or Arg-I
drink Arg-I
. O

Recent Arg-B
investigations Arg-I
reveal Arg-I
that Arg-I
toxic Arg-I
foods Arg-I
are Arg-I
sold Arg-I
pervasively Arg-I
in Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
market Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
overpopulation Arg-B
may Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
infectious Arg-I
deseases Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
cough Arg-I
, Arg-I
sneezing Arg-I
and Arg-I
illness Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
cities Arg-I
also Arg-I
means Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
areas Arg-I
. O

Unemployed Arg-B
workers Arg-I
or Arg-I
school Arg-I
dropouts Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
commit Arg-I
crime Arg-I
from Arg-I
petty Arg-I
offence Arg-I
to Arg-I
felony Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
burglary Arg-I
, Arg-I
pickpocketing Arg-I
, Arg-I
trickery Arg-I
, Arg-I
vandalism Arg-I
, Arg-I
smuggling Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
murder Arg-I
. O

Earning Arg-B
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
living Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
more Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
, Arg-I
living Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
places Arg-I
is Arg-I
getting Arg-I
harder Arg-I
also Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
life Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
both O
government O
and O
individual O
should O
take O
steps O
to O
diminish O
the O
consequences O
involved O
. O

Gun O
control O
and O
increasing O
violence O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
allowing O
policemen O
to O
carries O
firearms O
can O
increase O
violence O
in O
the O
society O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
this O
assertion O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
criminal Arg-B
minds Arg-I
that Arg-I
breed Arg-I
violence Arg-I
not Arg-I
stringent Arg-I
gun Arg-I
control Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
true O
that O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
gun Arg-I
control Arg-I
somehow Arg-I
crime Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
because O
fewer Arg-B
guns Arg-I
available Arg-I
mean Arg-I
less Arg-I
crime Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
as Arg-I
simple Arg-I
as Arg-I
it Arg-I
sounds Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
stringent Arg-B
gun Arg-I
control Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
violence Arg-I
and Arg-I
crime Arg-I
because O
most Arg-B
gun Arg-I
violence Arg-I
is Arg-I
committed Arg-I
with Arg-I
guns Arg-I
obtained Arg-I
illegally Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
intent Arg-I
to Arg-I
commit Arg-I
crime Arg-I
and Arg-I
control Arg-I
cities Arg-I
through Arg-I
gang Arg-I
violence Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
means Arg-I
will Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
guns Arg-I
, Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
gun Arg-I
control Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
law Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
abiding Arg-I
people Arg-I
anywhere Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
either Arg-I
polices Arg-I
or Arg-I
common Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the Arg-B
root Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
is Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
mind Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
weapon Arg-I
itself Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
government Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
crime Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
community Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
manage Arg-I
their Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
actions Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
gun Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
violent Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
poor Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
between Arg-I
polices Arg-I
carrying Arg-I
guns Arg-I
and Arg-I
an Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
violence Arg-I
rate Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
criminal Arg-B
mind Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
violence Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
we O
should O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
adjust O
people O
's O
behaviors O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
crimes O
instead O
of O
gun O
control O
. O

Education O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
socioeconomic O
status O
of O
a O
country O
Education O
is O
undeniably O
an O
economic O
necessity O
. O

In O
most O
countries O
, O
it O
makes O
up O
a O
considerable O
part O
of O
its O
national O

. O

In O
highly O

countries O
, O
undertakings O
are O
made O
to O
make O
it O
accessible O
and O

to O
all O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
education Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
single Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
country Arg-I

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
developing Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
many Arg-I
can Arg-I
afford Arg-I
to Arg-I
send Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
government Arg-I
schools Arg-I
where Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
fees Arg-I
are Arg-I
practically Arg-I
free Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
aplenty Arg-I
and Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
are Arg-I
situated Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cities Arg-I

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
reachable Arg-I
by Arg-I

who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I

These Arg-B
children Arg-I
whose Arg-I
parents Arg-I
are Arg-I
either Arg-I
farmers Arg-I

can Arg-I
hardly Arg-I

three Arg-I

get Arg-I
to Arg-I
these Arg-I
schools Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
these Arg-B
children Arg-I
remain Arg-I
uneducated Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
fate Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Development O

A Arg-B

A Arg-B

In O
the O

a Arg-B

the Arg-I

Collectively O

the Arg-B

a Arg-I

a Arg-I

Celebrities O

Some O

badly O
by O

people O
who O
become O
famous O
thanks O
to O
their O

To O
some O

First O
of O
all O

it O
is O
true O
that O
people Arg-B
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
an Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
are Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
mirror Arg-I
for Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
definitely Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
want Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
luxurious Arg-I
custom Arg-I
or Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
just Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
similar Arg-I
to Arg-I
someone Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
when Arg-I
these Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
symbols Arg-I
of Arg-I
any Arg-I
talent Arg-I
but Arg-I
showing Arg-I
off Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
young Arg-I
generation Arg-I
these Arg-I
days Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
toward Arg-I
positive Arg-I

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
being Arg-I
educated Arg-I
at Arg-I
very Arg-I
early Arg-I
ages Arg-I
by Arg-I
family Arg-I
or Arg-I
schools Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
influence Arg-I
young Arg-I

these Arg-I
days Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
well Arg-I

. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
not Arg-B
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
exist Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
' Arg-I
world Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
talents Arg-I

We Arg-B
are Arg-I
giving Arg-I
chances Arg-I

many Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
intelligence Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I

The Arg-I

Next Arg-I

As O
a O
result O
, O
to Arg-B
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
star Arg-I
and Arg-I
an Arg-I
inspiration Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
real Arg-I
talent Arg-I
to Arg-I
compete Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
candidates Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
only Arg-B
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
glamour Arg-I
look Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
enough Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
recognized Arg-I

, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
importance Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I

to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I

In O
conclusion O
, O
people Arg-B
without Arg-I

can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
famous Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
changing Arg-I

accredited Arg-I
they Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
positively Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I

. O

That O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
celebrities Arg-B
nowadays Arg-I
give Arg-I
more Arg-I
good Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
than Arg-I
they Arg-I
were Arg-I
previously Arg-I

Mobile O
phones O
: O
faster O
communication O
vs O
social O
problems O

Recently O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
social O
concern O
with O
regard O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
mobiles O
phones O
have O
negative O
effects O
on O
our O
social O
life O
. O

Indeed O
, O
mobile O
phones O
have O
widely O
been O
used O
by O
people O
of O
all O
ages O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
this Arg-B
great Arg-I
invention Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
21st Arg-I
century Arg-I
causes Arg-I
many Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
spending Arg-B
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
mobiles Arg-I
phones Arg-I
many Arg-I
exert Arg-I
an Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
our Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
as Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
phones Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
lose Arg-I
their Arg-I
interests Arg-I
on Arg-I
daily Arg-I
activities Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
meeting Arg-I
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
may Arg-I
impair Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
negotiation Arg-I
and Arg-I
interpersonal Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
continuous Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
may Arg-I
also Arg-I
damage Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
eyesight Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
posture Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phones Arg-I
frequently Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
growing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
mobiles Arg-I
games Arg-I
will Arg-I
impact Arg-I
their Arg-I
mental Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there Arg-B
many Arg-I
game Arg-I
applications Arg-I
available Arg-I
online Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
quite Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
in Arg-I
nature Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
these Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
characters Arg-I
to Arg-I
kill Arg-I
or Arg-I
shoot Arg-I
monsters Arg-I
or Arg-I
characters Arg-I
controlled Arg-I
by Arg-I
other Arg-I
players Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
many Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
aggressive Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
, Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
and Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
frequent Arg-B
conflicts Arg-I
may Arg-I
occur Arg-I
during Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
we O
may O
perceive O
this O
issue O
from O
different O
viewpoints O
. O

Mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
smart Arg-I
phones Arg-I
, Arg-I
has Arg-I
made Arg-I
our Arg-I
communication Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
, O
as Arg-B
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
telecommunication Arg-I
companies Arg-I
provide Arg-I
us Arg-I
with Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
internet Arg-I
via Arg-I
our Arg-I
phones Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
sending Arg-I
instant Arg-I
messages Arg-I
and Arg-I
making Arg-I
international Arg-I
calls Arg-I
free Arg-I
of Arg-I
charge Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
have Arg-I
shortened Arg-I
the Arg-I
distance Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
although O
mobile Arg-B
phones Arg-I
make Arg-I
our Arg-I
communication Arg-I
faster Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
also Arg-I
gives Arg-I
rise Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
social Arg-I
problems Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
mental Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
i O
highly O
advocate O
that O
we O
should O
use O
mobile O
phone O
in O
moderation O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
these O
serious O
problems O
. O

The O
environment O
problems O
facing O
today O
's O
world O
are O
so O
great O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
countries O
are O
concerned O
with O
the O
environment O
problems O
. O

There O
is O
a O
viewpoint O
that O
the O
government O
and O
big O
firms O
should O
assume O
the O
responsibility O
to O
protect O
the O
environment O
and O
normal O
citizens O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
for O
that O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
both Arg-B
government Arg-I
and Arg-I
common Arg-I
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, O
but O
we O
need O
to O
analyze O
some O
specific O
situations O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
solving Arg-B
some Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
needs Arg-I
large Arg-I
budgets Arg-I
and Arg-I
various Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
and Arg-I
corporations Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
these Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
air Arg-B
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
water Arg-I
quality Arg-I
has Arg-I
concerned Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
is Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
implement Arg-I
some Arg-I
policies Arg-I
and Arg-I
invest Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
companies Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
enhance Arg-I
their Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
to Arg-I
curb Arg-I
emission Arg-I
of Arg-I
contaminated Arg-I
water Arg-I
and Arg-I
substances Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
individuals Arg-B
are Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
these Arg-I
things Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
and Arg-I
firms Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
significant Arg-I
influences Arg-I
on Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
every Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
environment Arg-I
protection Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
that O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
convey Arg-I
corresponding Arg-I
policies Arg-I
and Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
and Arg-I
society Arg-I
, O
and O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
controls Arg-I
many Arg-I
influential Arg-I
media Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
TV Arg-I
stations Arg-I
and Arg-I
newspapers Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
related Arg-I
policies Arg-I
to Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
possible Arg-I
for Arg-I
ordinary Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
actions Arg-I
of Arg-I
environment Arg-I
protection Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
driving Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
could Arg-I
cause Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
overusing Arg-I
plastic Arg-I
packages Arg-I
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
change Arg-I
some Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
in Arg-I
these Arg-I
daily Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
significant Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
on Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
and Arg-I
corporations Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
more Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
for Arg-I
addressing Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
issues Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
every Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Is O
it O
necessary O
to O
teach O
children O
handwriting O
? O

In O
this O
age O
of O
modern O
technology O
, O
some O
people O
usually O
underestimate O
the O
importance O
of O
teaching O
handwriting O
for O
children O
. O

To O
some O
people O
, O
it O
is O
considered O
as O
an O
arduous O
and O
time O
consuming O
task O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
children Arg-B
are Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
under Arg-I
instruction Arg-I
of Arg-I
handwriting Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Despite O
the O
convenience O
from O
up O
- O
to O
- O
date O
facilities O
, O
handwriting Arg-B
still Arg-I
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
vital Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
this Arg-B
approach Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
basis Arg-I
tool Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
several Arg-I
fields Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
taking Arg-I
notes Arg-I
, Arg-I
doing Arg-I
homework Arg-I
and Arg-I
writing Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
enables Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
learners Arg-I
' Arg-I
spelling Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
and Arg-I
accompany Arg-I
reading Arg-I
or Arg-I
writing Arg-I
disabilities Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Under Arg-B
the Arg-I
guidance Arg-I
of Arg-I
parents Arg-I
or Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
practicing Arg-I
handwriting Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
writing Arg-I
will Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
content Arg-I
, Arg-I
elaborate Arg-I
in Arg-I
details Arg-I
and Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
organization Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
parents O
and O
schools O
should O
give O
priority O
on O
directing O
their O
kids O
about O
handwriting O
as O
poor Arg-B
handwriting Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
school Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
kids Arg-B
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
bad Arg-I
at Arg-I
handwriting Arg-I
meet Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
in Arg-I
taking Arg-I
notes Arg-I
and Arg-I
catching Arg-I
up Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
resulted Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
missing Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
details Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
increasing Arg-I
taking Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
could Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
be Arg-I
lazier Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
subjective Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
writing Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
of Arg-I
automatic Arg-I
grammar Arg-I
and Arg-I
spelling Arg-I
checking Arg-I
in Arg-I
office Arg-I
word Arg-I
, Arg-I
learners Arg-I
are Arg-I
now Arg-I
no Arg-I
need Arg-I
for Arg-I
noticing Arg-I
much Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
fast O
and O
convenient O
modern O
devices O
bring O
to O
us O
in O
writing O
, O
handwriting Arg-B
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
a Arg-I
needed Arg-I
skill Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
students Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

The O
tax O
reduction O
of O
state O
school O
for O
parents O
who O
have O
children O
studying O
in O
private O
system O

Some O
people O
who O
send O
their O
children O
to O
private O
schools O
contend O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
taxes O
they O
pay O
for O
the O
state O
education O
is O
unreasonable O
. O

However O
, O
I O
am O
utterly O
convinced O
that O
these Arg-B
taxes Arg-I
are Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
essential Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
by Arg-B
paying Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
for Arg-I
public Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
affluent Arg-I
people Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
narrowing Arg-I
down Arg-I
the Arg-I
gap Arg-I
between Arg-I
rich Arg-I
and Arg-I
poor Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
many Arg-B
poor Arg-I
families Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
afford Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
fees Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
kids Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
the Arg-I
tax Arg-I
amount Arg-I
for Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
pay Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
rich Arg-I
may Arg-I
help Arg-I
a Arg-I
vast Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
families Arg-I
with Arg-I
poverty Arg-I
background Arg-I
to Arg-I
continue Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
earn Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
tax Arg-I
reduction Arg-I
for Arg-I
parents Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
private Arg-I
schools Arg-I
would Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
capital Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
this Arg-B
reduction Arg-I
would Arg-I
cause Arg-I
a Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
tax Arg-I
calculation Arg-I
; O
therefore O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
recruit Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
workforce Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
handle Arg-I
this Arg-I
sophisticated Arg-I
issue Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
would Arg-I
also Arg-I
pay Arg-I
the Arg-I
salary Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
officials Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
this Arg-I
would Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
insufficient Arg-I
investments Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
public Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
education Arg-I
or Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
. O

Many O
parents O
supporting O
for O
the O
idea O
of O
tax O
discounts O
claim O
that O
such Arg-B
tax Arg-I
payments Arg-I
are Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

They O
point O
out O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
irrational Arg-I
to Arg-I
require Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
use Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we Arg-B
also Arg-I
pay Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
even Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
experience Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
employ Arg-I
like Arg-I
police Arg-I
or Arg-I
fire Arg-I
brigade Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
certainly Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
hope Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
reduction Arg-I
for Arg-I
these Arg-I
sorts Arg-I
of Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
that O
taxes Arg-B
paying Arg-I
for Arg-I
state Arg-I
schools Arg-I
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
compulsory Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
members Arg-I
of Arg-I
society Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
where Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
enroll Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

Arts O
and O
public O
services O
are O
both O
important O
to O
the O
community O
and O
should O
be O
invested O
properly O

There O
has O
been O
wide O
opinion O
that O
Government O
should O
invest O
more O
money O
on O
public O
services O
rather O
than O
arts O
such O
as O
music O
and O
theatre O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
perspective O
, O
both Arg-B
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
and Arg-I
arts Arg-I
worth Arg-I
investment Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
axiomatic O
that O
indispensable Arg-B
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
like Arg-I
hospital Arg-I
and Arg-I
school Arg-I
worth Arg-I
every Arg-I
penny Arg-I
investing Arg-I
. O

Investing Arg-B
in Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
helps Arg-I
improve Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
also Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
schools Arg-I
assists Arg-I
with Arg-I
raising Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
education Arg-I
level Arg-I
. O

Apparently O
if Arg-B
these Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
were Arg-I
not Arg-I
spent Arg-I
adequately Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
would Arg-I
deteriorate Arg-I
. O

But O
our Arg-B
standard Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
also Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
another Arg-I
factor Arg-I
- Arg-I
spiritual Arg-I
life Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
related Arg-I
closely Arg-I
with Arg-I
arts Arg-I
. O

Arts Arg-B
include Arg-I
many Arg-I
forms Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
cinema Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
typical Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
two Arg-I
art Arg-I
forms Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
with Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
significantly Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
income Arg-I
of Arg-I
film Arg-I
and Arg-I
music Arg-I
industries Arg-I
produce Arg-I
millions Arg-I
of Arg-I
dollars Arg-I
each Arg-I
year Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
Goverment Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
K Arg-I
- Arg-I
pop Arg-I
and Arg-I
Hollywood Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
these Arg-I
industries Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
survive Arg-I
without Arg-I
goverment Arg-I
's Arg-I
financial Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
. O

The O
long O
and O
the O
short O
of O
it O
, O
both Arg-B
arts Arg-I
and Arg-I
public Arg-I
services Arg-I
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
and Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
invested Arg-I
properly Arg-I
. O

Modern O
technology O
has O
impacted O
the O
traditional O
cultures O
in O
both O
negative O
and O
positive O
ways O

Nowadays O
, O
technology O
has O
been O
developing O
significantly O
, O
impacting O
many O
aspects O
of O
our O
life O
. O

While O
there O
is O
belief O
that O
technology O
advances O
means O
a O
lost O
in O
traditional O
cultures O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
although O
the Arg-B
affect Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
on Arg-I
culture Arg-I
is Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
also Arg-I
contributed Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditonal Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
improved Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
gadgets Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
invention Arg-I
of Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
and Arg-I
internet Arg-I
has Arg-I
changed Arg-I
our Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
working Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
has Arg-I
also Arg-I
been Arg-I
much Arg-I
less Arg-I
labourous Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
pass Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
of Arg-I
electrical Arg-I
machineries Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
these Arg-B
newfangled Arg-I
practices Arg-I
has Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
many Arg-I
old Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
factories Arg-B
equipped Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
and Arg-I
highly Arg-I
- Arg-I
productive Arg-I
system Arg-I
has Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
old Arg-I
handmade Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
exchange Arg-I
of Arg-I
letters Arg-I
among Arg-I
friends Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
as Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
had Arg-I
emails Arg-I
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
network Arg-I
instead Arg-I
, Arg-I
new Arg-I
video Arg-I
games Arg-I
has Arg-I
superseded Arg-I
the Arg-I
old Arg-I
- Arg-I
physical Arg-I
ones Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
old Arg-I
traditionally Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
things Arg-I
have Arg-I
long Arg-I
gone Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
drawback O
mentioned O
above O
, O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
also Arg-I
made Arg-I
some Arg-I
contributions Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
maintenance Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
ways Arg-I

the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identity Arg-I

With Arg-B
the Arg-I

To O
give O
a O
brief O
conclusion O
, O
Modern Arg-B
technogy Arg-I
has Arg-I
impacted Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
in Arg-I
both Arg-I
negative Arg-I

ways Arg-I

But O
I O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
this Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
worrying Arg-I
tread Arg-I
which Arg-I
has Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
first Arg-I
impression Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
seems Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
rich Arg-I
while Arg-I
not Arg-I
having Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
hard Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
gives Arg-I
children Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
hard Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
career Arg-I
and Arg-I
earning Arg-I
a Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

Further O
more O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
value Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I

hard Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
everything Arg-I

granted Arg-I

Meanwhile O
, O
not Arg-B
all Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
are Arg-I
role Arg-I
models Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
uncommon Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
media Arg-I
that Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
committing Arg-I
to Arg-I
crimes Arg-I

misbehaving Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I

addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
drugs Arg-I

. O

Worse O
still O
, O
without Arg-B
proper Arg-I

may Arg-I
perceive Arg-I
that Arg-I
this Arg-I

Of O

some Arg-B

good Arg-I

media Arg-B
should Arg-I
shift Arg-I
its Arg-I
focus Arg-I
from Arg-I
covering Arg-I
celebrities Arg-I
to Arg-I
elsewhere Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
children O
's O
access O
to O
the O
celebrities O
news O
on O
the O
media O
should O
be O
restricted O
and O
they O
should O
study O
only O
from O
the O
celebrities O
who O
can O
act O
positively O
. O

A O
greater O
proportion O
of O
the O
budget O
should O
be O
allotted O
to O
education O
and O
prevention O
issues O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
welfare O
state O
requires O
governments O
to O
provide O
sustainable O
healthcare O
and O
health O
education O
to O
their O
citizens O
. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
devote Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
portion Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
health Arg-I
budgets Arg-I
to Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
means Arg-I
for Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
first Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
preventative Arg-I
measures Arg-I
should Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
budget Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
potential Arg-I
improvements Arg-I
in Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
decreasing Arg-B
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
and Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
centers Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
managed Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
better Arg-I
treatments Arg-I
for Arg-I
current Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
society Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
educated Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
health Arg-I
issues Arg-I
so O
that O
the Arg-B
potential Arg-I
precautions Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
illnesses Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
taken Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
increasing Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
patients Arg-I
. O

The O
second O
reason O
why O
governments Arg-B
should Arg-I
allocate Arg-I
more Arg-I
budget Arg-I
on Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
from Arg-I
illness Arg-I
and Arg-I
providing Arg-I
health Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
health Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
welfare Arg-I
come Arg-I
with Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
government Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
providing Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
lead Arg-I
its Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
from Arg-I
potential Arg-I
illness Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
cause Arg-I
misery Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
marketing Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
of Arg-I
Ministry Arg-I
of Arg-I
Health Arg-I
in Arg-I
Turkey Arg-I
which Arg-I
aimed Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
problem Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
youth Arg-I
increased Arg-I
the Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
quit Arg-I
smoking Arg-I
and Arg-I
adapted Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
greater Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
allotted Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
issues Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I
health Arg-I
system Arg-I
and Arg-I
greater Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
well Arg-I

Fatherhood O
should O
be O
as O
present O
as O
motherhood O
in O
a O
child O
's O
life O
starting O
from O
the O
the O
birth O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
having O
and O
raising O
children O
can O
be O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
for O
families O
, O
the O
smallest O
component O
of O
the O
society O
. O

While O
mother O
's O
role O
is O
essential O
in O
a O
child O
's O
life O
, O
I O
completely O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
fatherhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
as Arg-I
vital Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
healty Arg-I
parantage Arg-I
as Arg-I
much Arg-I
as Arg-I
motherhood Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
first Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
the Arg-I
father Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
equal Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
mother Arg-I
's Arg-I
role Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
of Arg-I
parantage Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the Arg-B
role Arg-I
models Arg-I
within Arg-I
a Arg-I
family Arg-I
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
child Arg-I
's Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
in Arg-B
a Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
Turkish Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
mother Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
sincere Arg-I
and Arg-I
thoughtful Arg-I
approach Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
child Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
father Arg-I
role Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
present Arg-I
as Arg-I
authoritarian Arg-I
and Arg-I
conversative Arg-I
to Arg-I
raise Arg-I
a Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
behaved Arg-I
child Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
second Arg-I
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
I Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
fatherood Arg-I
is Arg-I
as Arg-I
important Arg-I
as Arg-I
motherhood Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
dynamics Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
today Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we Arg-B
are Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
that Arg-I
puts Arg-I
a Arg-I
significant Arg-I
importance Arg-I
to Arg-I
gender Arg-I
equality Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
family Arg-I
formed Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
woman Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
housewife Arg-I
role Arg-I
who Arg-I
looks Arg-I
after Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
and Arg-I
takes Arg-I
care Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
man Arg-I
who Arg-I
brings Arg-I
money Arg-I
home Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
seen Arg-I
anymore Arg-I
in Arg-I
today Arg-I
's Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
all Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
couple Arg-I
duties Arg-I
are Arg-I
performed Arg-I
equally Arg-I
and Arg-I
interchangeably Arg-I
by Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
having Arg-B
and Arg-I
raising Arg-I
children Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
different Arg-I
than Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
daily Arg-I
activity Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
fatherhood Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
as Arg-I
present Arg-I
as Arg-I
motherhood Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
starting Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
the Arg-I
birth Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
providing Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
parenthood Arg-I
and Arg-I
having Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
family Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

Children O
should O
studying O
hard O
or O
playing O
sport O
? O

Both O
can O
improve O
their O
future O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
studying O
hard O
is O
essential O
part O
for O
children O
, O
otherwise O
others O
people O
think O
that O
playing O
sport O
is O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
both Arg-B
of Arg-I
studying Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
playing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
are Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
studying Arg-B
hard Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
children Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Studying Arg-B
hard Arg-I
gives Arg-I
children Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
skills Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Naturally O
, O
children O
will O
be O
growing O
up O
and O
looking O
for O
their O
job O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
children Arg-B
who Arg-I
always Arg-I
studying Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
getting Arg-I
high Arg-I
achievement Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
pass Arg-I
qualification Arg-I
for Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
great Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
multinational Arg-I
company Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
working Arg-I
at Arg-I
multinational Arg-I
company Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
result Arg-I
is Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
higher Arg-I
salary Arg-I
. O

The O
message O
is O
when Arg-B
you Arg-I
always Arg-I
studying Arg-I
harder Arg-I
than Arg-I
others Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
best Arg-I
results Arg-I
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
playing Arg-B
sports Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
good Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
many O
popular O
sports O
among O
children O
such O
as O
football O
, O
basketball O
, O
and O
volleyball O
. O

Also O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
when Arg-I
children Arg-I
doing Arg-I
sport Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
children Arg-B
who Arg-I
always Arg-I
playing Arg-I
sport Arg-I
like Arg-I
football Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
active Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
team Arg-I
- Arg-I
player Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
because O
indirectly Arg-B
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
team Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
will Arg-I
make Arg-I
children Arg-I
getting Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
positively Arg-I
to Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
playing Arg-B
sport Arg-I
makes Arg-I
children Arg-I
getting Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
both Arg-B
studying Arg-I
hard Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
playing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O
