International O
tourism O
is O
now O
more O
common O
than O
ever O
before O

The O
last O
50 O
years O
have O
seen O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
tourist O
traveling O
worldwide O
. O

While O
some O
might O
think O
the Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
bring Arg-I
large Arg-I
profit Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
this Arg-B
industry Arg-I
has Arg-I
affected Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
attributes Arg-I
and Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
destinations Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
an O
undeniable O
fact O
that O
tourists Arg-B
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
will Arg-I
probably Arg-I
cause Arg-I
changes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identity Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
destinations Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
Thailand Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
Vietnam Arg-I
War Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
American Arg-I
soldiers Arg-I
came Arg-I
to Arg-I
Thailand Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
break Arg-I
and Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
sexual Arg-I
and Arg-I
drug Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
huge Arg-I
demands Arg-I
caused Arg-I
many Arg-I
local Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
opened Arg-I
and Arg-I
expanded Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
illegally Arg-I
involved Arg-I
in Arg-I
under Arg-I
- Arg-I
age Arg-I
prostitutes Arg-I
to Arg-I
maximize Arg-I
their Arg-I
profits Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
was Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
controls Arg-I
by Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
and Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
image Arg-I
of Arg-I
Thailand Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
this O
proves O
that O
international Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
can Arg-I
create Arg-I
negative Arg-I
impacts Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
clear O
evidences O
that O
tourism Arg-B
increasingly Arg-I
create Arg-I
harms Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
natural Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
appeals Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
the Arg-I
Australia Arg-I
’s Arg-I
Great Arg-I
Barrier Arg-I
Reef Arg-I
has Arg-I
shown Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
billion Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
per Arg-I
annum Arg-I
has Arg-I
generated Arg-I
immense Arg-I
destruction Arg-I
to Arg-I
this Arg-I
nature Arg-I
wonder Arg-I
, Arg-I
namely Arg-I
breaking Arg-I
the Arg-I
corals Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
walking Arg-I
or Arg-I
throwing Arg-I
boat Arg-I
’s Arg-I
anchors Arg-I
, Arg-I
dropping Arg-I
fuel Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
sorts Arg-I
of Arg-I
pollutions Arg-I
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
many Arg-B
marine Arg-I
lives Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
endangered Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
extremes Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
reef Arg-I
become Arg-I
uninhabitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
these Arg-I
marine Arg-I
species Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
tourism Arg-B
has Arg-I
threatened Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
environments Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
has Arg-I
created Arg-I
threatening Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
both Arg-I
the Arg-I
sociocultural Arg-I
and Arg-I
natural Arg-I
environments Arg-I
. O

If O
authorities O
do O
not O
take O
steps O
to O
appropriately O
conserve O
these O
precious O
values O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

Living O
and O
studying O
overseas O

It O
is O
every O
student O
's O
desire O
to O
study O
at O
a O
good O
university O
and O
experience O
a O
new O
environment O
. O

While O
some O
students O
study O
and O
live O
overseas O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
some O
prefer O
to O
study O
home O
because O
of O
the O
difficulties O
of O
living O
and O
studying O
overseas O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
one Arg-B
who Arg-I
studies Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
will Arg-I
gain Arg-I
many Arg-I
skills Arg-I
throughout Arg-I
this Arg-I
experience Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
studying Arg-B
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
university Arg-I
gives Arg-I
individuals Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
social Arg-I
skills Arg-I
by Arg-I
interacting Arg-I
and Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
with Arg-I
students Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
origins Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

Compared Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
peers Arg-I
studying Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
living Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
adapting Arg-I
himself Arg-I
/ Arg-I
herself Arg-I
into Arg-I
new Arg-I
environments Arg-I
and Arg-I
situations Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
living Arg-B
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
irreplaceable Arg-I
experience Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
standing Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
feet Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
living Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
will Arg-I
of Arg-I
course Arg-I
struggle Arg-I
with Arg-I
loneliness Arg-I
, Arg-I
living Arg-I
away Arg-I
from Arg-I
family Arg-I
and Arg-I
friends Arg-I
but O
those Arg-B
difficulties Arg-I
will Arg-I
turn Arg-I
into Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
following Arg-I
steps Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
one Arg-I
will Arg-I
learn Arg-I
living Arg-I
without Arg-I
depending Arg-I
on Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
else Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
employers Arg-B
are Arg-I
mostly Arg-I
looking Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
international Arg-I
and Arg-I
language Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

Becoming Arg-B
successful Arg-I
in Arg-I
this Arg-I
study Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
the Arg-I
student Arg-I
an Arg-I
edge Arg-I
in Arg-I
job Arg-I
market Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
one Arg-B
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
studied Arg-I
and Arg-I
lived Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
eligible Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
job Arg-I
than Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
peers Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
might Arg-I
face Arg-I
when Arg-I
studying Arg-I
and Arg-I
living Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
living Arg-B
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
overseas Arg-I
gives Arg-I
the Arg-I
individual Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
subject Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
studied Arg-I
or Arg-I
in Arg-I
general Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Studies O
abroad O
and O
the O
cultural O
aspect O
of O
the O
experience O
Studying O
abroad O
is O
one O
very O
common O
thing O
that O
students O
do O
, O
and O
they O
have O
different O
reasons O
for O
that O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
studying Arg-B
abroad Arg-I
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
gain Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
experience Arg-I
personally Arg-I
, Arg-I
academically Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
culturally Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
study Arg-I
outside Arg-I
their Arg-I
countries Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
experience Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
requires Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
flexibility Arg-I
and Arg-I
adaptability Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
character Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
might Arg-I
face Arg-I
many Arg-I
challenges Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
host Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
. O

Overcoming Arg-B
problems Arg-I
teaches Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
mature Arg-I
and Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
independence Arg-I
. O

One O
other O
important O
factor O
is O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
academic Arg-I
experience Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
institution Arg-I
where Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
pursuing Arg-I
their Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
get Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
different Arg-I
educational Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
will Arg-I
meet Arg-I
new Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
new Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
which Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
experience Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
that Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
important Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
meet Arg-I
different Arg-I
people Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
customs Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
about Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
contributes Arg-I
in Arg-I
building Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
in Arg-I
us Arg-I
of Arg-I
how Arg-I
we Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
makes Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
open Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
accept Arg-I
different Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
and Arg-I
thoughts Arg-I
. O

Also O
it Arg-B
educates Arg-I
us Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
studying Arg-B
abroad Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
have Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
change Arg-I
us Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
positive Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

It O
can O
influence O
us O
in O
different O
aspects O
of O
life O
. O

Advertisements O
affects O
on O
consumer O
goods O
Everyday O
, O
companies O
offer O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
different O
products O
to O
consumers O
. O

The Arg-B
most Arg-I
effective Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
convince Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
to Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
is Arg-I
through Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
sufficient Arg-I
in Arg-I
itself Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
product Arg-I
also Arg-I
should Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
the Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
major Arg-I
reason Arg-I
for Arg-I
high Arg-I
sales Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

We Arg-B
are Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
to Arg-I
products Arg-I
through Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
advertisers Arg-B
push Arg-I
the Arg-I
limits Arg-I
of Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
to Arg-I
dispose Arg-I
the Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
to Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
are Arg-I
impressed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
is Arg-I
advertised Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
convinced Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
need Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
cases Arg-I
. O

Recently Arg-B
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
creative Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
soft Arg-I
drink Arg-I
product Arg-I
on Arg-I
TV Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
story Arg-I
delivers Arg-I
a Arg-I
desired Arg-I
call Arg-I
to Arg-I
drink Arg-I
that Arg-I
soft Arg-I
drink Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
drink Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
weather Arg-I
is Arg-I
too Arg-I
hot Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
the Arg-B
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
that Arg-I
product Arg-I
being Arg-I
sold Arg-I
will Arg-I
increases Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
the Arg-B
more Arg-I
an Arg-I
advertisement Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
takes Arg-I
place Arg-I
in Arg-I
mass Arg-I
media Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
popular Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
. O

Advertisement Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
effective Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
a Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
known Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

Consumers Arg-B
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
purchase Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
known Arg-I
product Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
picking Arg-I
one Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
two Arg-I
different Arg-I
brands Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
is Arg-I
commonly Arg-I
used Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
becomes Arg-I
trustworthy Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
what Arg-I
quality Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
it Arg-B
also Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
affordable Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
consumer Arg-I
. O

Considering O
this O
fact O
, O
advertisements Arg-B
have Arg-I
undeniable Arg-I
affects Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
being Arg-I
advertised Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
product Arg-I
preferable Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
as O
I O
believe O
that O
consumers O
should O
consider O
major O
needs O
when O
they O
purchase O
goods O
, O
high Arg-B
sales Arg-I
are Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
a Arg-I
reflection Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
powerful Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
. O

Paying O
more O
money O
is O
the O
only O
motivation O
to O
make O
employees O
work O
harder O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
essay O
is O
to O
discuss O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
only O
way O
to O
motivate O
employees O
to O
be O
more O
hard O
- O
working O
and O
productive O
is O
by O
raising O
their O
salaries O
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
would O
start O
by O
analyzing O
the O
factors O
for O
higher O
yields O
and O
finish O
by O
stating O
my O
position O
on O
this O
. O

A Arg-B
raise Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
promotion Arg-I
can Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
morale Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
working Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

Workers Arg-B
understand Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
harder Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
boss Arg-I
' Arg-I
expectations Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
worthwhile Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
junior Arg-B
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
private Arg-I
lives Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
through Arg-I
adolescence Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
work Arg-I
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
phase Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
hard Arg-I
and Arg-I
get Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
receive Arg-I
higher Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
extra Arg-I
time Arg-I
mentoring Arg-I
the Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
hoping Arg-I
they Arg-I
learn Arg-I
in Arg-I
cram Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
what Arg-I
is Arg-I
happening Arg-I
in Arg-I
Taiwan Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
creating Arg-B
an Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
working Arg-I
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
realistic Arg-I
and Arg-I
essential Arg-I
if Arg-I
one Arg-I
wishes Arg-I
an Arg-I
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
and Arg-I
better Arg-I
employee Arg-I
performances Arg-I
. O

Take Arg-B
Google Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
company Arg-I
offers Arg-I
recreation Arg-I
rooms Arg-I
and Arg-I
extra Arg-I
personal Arg-I

their Arg-I
workers Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
relaxing Arg-I
and Arg-I
supportive Arg-I
workforce Arg-I
. O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
the Arg-B
employers Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
the Arg-I
employees Arg-I
can Arg-I
actually Arg-I
focus Arg-I
and Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
projects Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
thinking Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
or Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
pressured Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
a Arg-B
higher Arg-I
pay Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
incentive Arg-I
if Arg-I
were Arg-I
to Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
harder Arg-I
- Arg-I
working Arg-I
employees Arg-I
. O

Alternatively O
, O
providing Arg-B
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
secured Arg-I
and Arg-I
relaxing Arg-I
environment Arg-I
for Arg-I
workers Arg-I
can Arg-I
fundamentally Arg-I
boost Arg-I
their Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
since O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
more Arg-I
cared Arg-I
for Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
do Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
bosses Arg-I

Advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
prevalent O
of O
English O
With O
the O
development O
of O
globalization O
, O
English O
became O
the O
dominated O
language O
in O
national O
trade O
, O
conference O
and O
many O
important O
events O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
has O
aroused O
a O
heated O
discussion O
in O
public O
. O

Some O
people O
claim O
that O
the Arg-B
prevalent Arg-I
of Arg-I
English Arg-I
brings Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it Arg-B
promotes Arg-I
the Arg-I
communication Arg-I
and Arg-I
interaction Arg-I
between Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
more Arg-I
conveniently Arg-I
and Arg-I
clearly Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
ancient Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
languages Arg-I
and Arg-I
geography Arg-I
set Arg-I
barriers Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
exchange Arg-I
their Arg-I
goods Arg-I
and Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

Fortunately O
, O
the Arg-B
innovation Arg-I
of Arg-I
plane Arg-I
and Arg-I
train Arg-I
solved Arg-I
the Arg-I
geographical Arg-I
barriers Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
popularize Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
English Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
language Arg-I
hinder Arg-I
will Arg-I
disappear Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
English Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
systematical Arg-I
and Arg-I
extensive Arg-I
than Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
English Arg-I
can Arg-I
foster Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
sentiment Arg-I
and Arg-I
nourish Arg-I
their Arg-I
literature Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the O
opponents O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
dominated Arg-I
status Arg-I
of Arg-I
English Arg-I
has Arg-I
destroyed Arg-I
culture Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
and Arg-I
many Arg-I
less Arg-I
- Arg-I
used Arg-I
languages Arg-I
become Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
. O

Even O
English Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
sophisticated Arg-I
language Arg-I
; O
it Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
express Arg-I
every Arg-I
detail Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
especially Arg-I
in Arg-I
Asia Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
have Arg-I
totally Arg-I
different Arg-I
linguistic Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
language Arg-B
contains Arg-I
many Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
influenced Arg-I
by Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
environment Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
religious Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
these Arg-B
languages Arg-I
have Arg-I
special Arg-I
significance Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
belong Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
using Arg-I
English Arg-I
to Arg-I
replace Arg-I
them Arg-I
is Arg-I
crudity Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
English Arg-B
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
elegant Arg-I
language Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
advocated Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
fields Arg-I
to Arg-I
expand Arg-I
the Arg-I
global Arg-I
trade Arg-I
and Arg-I
communications Arg-I
. O

But O
, O
we Arg-B
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
other Arg-I
languages Arg-I
for Arg-I
sake Arg-I
of Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
the Arg-I
linguistic Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultural Arg-I

The Arg-B

For O

today Arg-B

Moreover O

future Arg-B

very Arg-I
bright Arg-I

From Arg-B
a Arg-I

Nanotechnology Arg-B

They Arg-B

even Arg-I

Computers Arg-B

intruded Arg-I
our Arg-I

the Arg-I

The Arg-B
recent Arg-I
case Arg-I
of Arg-I
Wikileaks Arg-I
, Arg-I
leaking Arg-I

is Arg-I
an Arg-I
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
how Arg-I

harmful Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
with O
all O
the O
mentioned O
demerits O
, O
computers Arg-B
have Arg-I
provided Arg-I
security Arg-I

sophistication Arg-I
too O
. O

Thus O
, O
dependence Arg-B
on Arg-I
computers Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
thing Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
one O
needs O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
all O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
and O
beware O
of O
malicious O
things O
. O

Computer O

fulfilled O

Human O
life O
today O

n't O
be O
imagined O

so O
not O

out O
of O
question O

Should O
government O
control O

The O
soaring O
crime O

has O
led O
to O
the O
proposal O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
action Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
the Arg-I
proliferation Arg-I
of Arg-I
violent Arg-I
scenes Arg-I
in Arg-I

. O

Obviously O
, O
violence O
in O
the O
media O
is O
often O
portrayed O
as O
extreme O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
attract O
audiences O
. O

This Arg-B
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
set Arg-I
a Arg-I
bad Arg-I
example Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
immature Arg-I
audiences Arg-I
who Arg-I
, Arg-I
lacking Arg-I
correct Arg-I
parental Arg-I
guidance Arg-I
and Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
to Arg-I
differentiate Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
from Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
, Arg-I
are Arg-I
prone Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
astray Arg-I
by Arg-I
imitating Arg-I
the Arg-I
violent Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
and Arg-I
committing Arg-I
real Arg-I
violent Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
as O
they Arg-B
regard Arg-I
the Arg-I
violence Arg-I
as Arg-I
reasonable Arg-I
and Arg-I
justifiable Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O

media Arg-B
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I

considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
correct Arg-I
information Arg-I
source Arg-I
regulated Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
reporting Arg-I

reflecting Arg-I
true Arg-I
phenomenon Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Violence Arg-B
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
facts Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
reported Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
excessive Arg-B
violence Arg-I
would Arg-I
offer Arg-I
misleading Arg-I
information Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
and Arg-I
exert Arg-I
detrimental Arg-I
influence Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
recently Arg-I
reported Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
news Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
seventeen Arg-I
- Arg-I
year Arg-I
- Arg-I
old Arg-I
boy Arg-I
killed Arg-I
all Arg-I
his Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
sister Arg-I
and Arg-I
two Arg-I
parents Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
hatred Arg-I
and Arg-I
jealousy Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
world Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
inclined Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
extreme Arg-I
approach Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
problem Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
violence Arg-I
exposure Arg-I
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
that O
our Arg-B
society Arg-I
is Arg-I
occupied Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
violent Arg-I
scenes Arg-I
and Arg-I
plots Arg-I
at Arg-I
present Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
strengthen Arg-I
censorship Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
the Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
media Arg-I
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
violent O
crime O
rate O
will O
rise O
continuously O
and O
out O
of O
control O
someday O
. O

Should O
all O
the O
advertisements O
be O
banned O
? O

Never O
in O
history O
was O
advertising O
industry O
so O
developed O
as O
in O
modern O
society O
and O
it O
has O
led O
to O
some O
adverse O
sentiments O
in O
public O
because O
some O
deliver O
exaggerated O
and O
fake O
information O
. O

Hence O
whether O
we O
should O
ban O
all O
the O
advertisements O
or O
not O
has O
aroused O
much O
controversy O
of O
the O
public O
. O

My O
view O
is O
that O
while Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
are Arg-I
disturbing Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
overlook Arg-I
other Arg-I
merits Arg-I
the Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
bring Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
to Arg-I
restrict Arg-I
those Arg-I
public Arg-I
service Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
creative Arg-I
and Arg-I
inspiring Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
making Arg-I
profits Arg-I
but Arg-I
taking Arg-I
a Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
disseminating Arg-I
valued Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
good Arg-I
moral Arg-I
traits Arg-I
and Arg-I
calling Arg-I
for Arg-I
helps Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
disabled Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
poor Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
publicizing Arg-B
brand Arg-I
image Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
product Arg-I
of Arg-I
mass Arg-I
media Arg-I
could Arg-I
boost Arg-I
sales Arg-I
for Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
larger O
sense O
, O
it Arg-B
could Arg-I
simulate Arg-I
household Arg-I
spending Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
recent Arg-I
study Arg-I
shows Arg-I
that Arg-I
after Arg-I
launching Arg-I
an Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
sales Arg-I
revenue Arg-I
would Arg-I
increase Arg-I
by Arg-I
40 Arg-I
% Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
very Arg-I
fact Arg-I
to Arg-I
verify Arg-I
its Arg-I
positive Arg-I
influences Arg-I
on Arg-I
economic Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
however O
, O
that O
advertisements O
have O
no O
downsides O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the Arg-B
advertising Arg-I
expenses Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
product Arg-I
price Arg-I
and Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
express Arg-I
fake Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
creating Arg-I
information Arg-I
asymmetry Arg-I
between Arg-I
consumers Arg-I
and Arg-I
companies Arg-I
. O

Yet O
, O
its Arg-B
merits Arg-I
still Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
these Arg-I
downsides Arg-I
. O

Taken O
all O
together O
, O
advertisements Arg-B
have Arg-I
its Arg-I
social Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
and Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
economic Arg-I
growth Arg-I
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
all O
of O
them O
. O

However O
, O
if O
those O
with O
exaggerated O
and O
fake O
information O
could O
be O
banned O
, O
advertisements O
would O
be O
welcomed O
by O
more O
. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
relax O
is O
by O
exercises O

In O
modern O
society O
, O
people O
often O
face O
many O
difficulties O
under O
great O
stress O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
many O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
relax O
. O

Although O
miscellaneous O
people O
may O
apply O
diverse O
strategies O
, O
such O
as O
reading O
, O
watching O
movies O
, O
or O
working O
in O
their O
gardens O
, O
I O
argue O
that O
the Arg-B
most Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
stress Arg-I
for Arg-I
modern Arg-I
people Arg-I
is Arg-I
by Arg-I
different Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
improve Arg-I
health Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
bring Arg-I
positive Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprised O
that O
exercise Arg-B
play Arg-I
a Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
ameliorating Arg-I
physical Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Any Arg-B
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
sports Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
jogging Arg-I
, Arg-I
swimming Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
playing Arg-I
basketball Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
facilitate Arg-I
human Arg-I
respiration Arg-I
and Arg-I
circulation Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
sports Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
strengthen Arg-I
muscles Arg-I
and Arg-I
lessen Arg-I
surplus Arg-I
adipose Arg-I
tissues Arg-I
in Arg-I
human Arg-I
body Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
latter Arg-I
one Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
particular Arg-I
importance Arg-I
because Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
from Arg-I
obesity Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
studies Arg-I
has Arg-I
points Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
overweight Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
increased Arg-I
in Arg-I
developed Arg-I
countries Arg-I
in Arg-I
recent Arg-I
years Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
results Arg-I
from Arg-I
insufficient Arg-I
exercises Arg-I
. O

Sports Arg-B
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
mental Arg-I
health Arg-I
as O
well O
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
neuron Arg-I
cells Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
brain Arg-I
release Arg-I
a Arg-I
chemical Arg-I
compound Arg-I
named Arg-I
Dopamine Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
hormone Arg-I
can Arg-I
delight Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
mind Arg-I
, Arg-I
creating Arg-I
positive Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
. O

Thus O
good Arg-B
exercises Arg-I
can Arg-I
often Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
alleviating Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
burdens Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
rigorous Arg-B
exercise Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
hone Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
will Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
enable Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
stringent Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
arduous Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
many Arg-B
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
let Arg-I
humans Arg-I
relax Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
assert O
that O
the Arg-B
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
diminishing Arg-I
stress Arg-I
is Arg-I
by Arg-I
exercises Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
physically Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
mentally Arg-I
. O

Zoos O
should O
be O
banned O
Children O
tend O
to O
visit O
zoos O
where O
various O
kinds O
of O
wild O
creatures O
could O
be O
seen O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
whether O
zoos O
should O
exist O
on O
contemporary O
society O
, O
animal O
- O
right O
activists O
strongly O
recommended O
that O
wildlife O
belong O
to O
natural O
environment O
and O
zoos O
should O
be O
banned O
. O

I O
would O
not O
go O
along O
with O
their O
viewpoint O
as O
zoos Arg-B
have Arg-I
irreplaceable Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
animal Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
and Arg-I
children Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

There O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
our Arg-B
environment Arg-I
is Arg-I
damaged Arg-I
day Arg-I
by Arg-I
day Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
fact Arg-I
that Arg-I
excessive Arg-I
pursuit Arg-I
of Arg-I
economic Arg-I
development Arg-I
at Arg-I
expense Arg-I
of Arg-I
eco Arg-I
- Arg-I
system Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
pose Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
threat Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
survival Arg-I
of Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
zoo Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
alternative Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
protecting Arg-I
animals Arg-I
as O
various Arg-B
animals Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
protected Arg-I
by Arg-I
specialized Arg-I
staff Arg-I
. O

Once Arg-B
the Arg-I
animal Arg-I
got Arg-I
sick Arg-I
, Arg-I
professional Arg-I
vet Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
promptly Arg-I
. O

Thanks Arg-B
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
considerate Arg-I
care Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
of Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animal Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
guaranteed Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
zoos Arg-B
afford Arg-I
a Arg-I
platform Arg-I
to Arg-I
education Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
, Arg-I
helping Arg-I
to Arg-I
establish Arg-I
eco Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
towards Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
though Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
are Arg-I
caged Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
capability Arg-I
to Arg-I
walk Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
limited Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
children Arg-I
pay Arg-I
a Arg-I
visit Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
still Arg-I
could Arg-I
observe Arg-I
the Arg-I
eating Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
or Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
activities Arg-I
among Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
would Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
enrich Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
associated Arg-I
with Arg-I
different Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Further O
, O
children Arg-B
could Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
regarding Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
guided Arg-I
tour Arg-I
or Arg-I
volunteers Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
complained Arg-B
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
of Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
heard Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
some Arg-B
zoos Arg-I
are Arg-I
lack Arg-I
of Arg-I
systematic Arg-I
management Arg-I
which Arg-I
attributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
numerous Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
die Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
food Arg-I
shortage Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
being Arg-B
caged Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoos Arg-I
for Arg-I
long Arg-I
render Arg-I
wildlife Arg-I
lost Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
survive Arg-I
in Arg-I
nature Arg-I
where Arg-I
is Arg-I
full Arg-I
of Arg-I
cruel Arg-I
competition Arg-I
among Arg-I
various Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

In O
order O
to O
protect O
animals O
, O
from O
my O
perspective O
, O
zoos Arg-B
offer Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
man Arg-I
- Arg-I
made Arg-I
environment Arg-I
which Arg-I
could Arg-I
prolong Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
span Arg-I
of Arg-I
wild Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultivate Arg-I
the Arg-I
notion Arg-I
of Arg-I
protecting Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

What O
the O
zoos O
should O
do O
is O
improvement O
of O
the O
management O
system O
and O
use O
the O
income O
wisely O
in O

Advertising O
- O
positive O
or O
negative O
part O
of O
our O
lives O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
use O
of O
advertisement O
through O
different O
forms O
of O
media O
such O
as O
newspapers O
, O
radio O
and O
television O
has O
become O
very O
prevalent O
, O
so O
it O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
today O
's O
society O
. O

Many O
believe O
that O
advertising O
has O
brought O
great O
benefits O
to O
lives O
therefore O
it O
should O
be O
considered O
a O
positive O
activity O
while O
others O
have O
held O
a O
complete O
different O
idea O
about O
this O
. O

Both O
views O
will O
be O
critiqued O
before O
a O
reasonable O
conclusion O
is O
drawn O
. O

First O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
understood O
that O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
carried Arg-I
out Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
promoting Arg-I
different Arg-I
products Arg-I
and Arg-I
services Arg-I
or Arg-I
encouraging Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
consume Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Advertisements Arg-B
are Arg-I
, Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
sales Arg-I
and Arg-I
hence Arg-I
profits Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
to Arg-B
consumers Arg-I
, Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
them Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
customers Arg-B
of Arg-I
telecommunication Arg-I
services Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
idea Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
offers Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
companies Arg-I
and O
hence O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
compare Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
decision Arg-I
in Arg-I
choosing Arg-I
their Arg-I
internet Arg-I
or Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
plans Arg-I
. O

From O
all O
of O
these O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
see O
why O
the O
idea O
that O
advertising O
is O
a O
positive O
part O
of O
life O
will O
garner O
strong O
support O
. O

However O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
people O
have O
argued O
against O
advertising O
due O
to O
its O
negative O
impacts O
. O

Firstly O
, O
a Arg-B
huge Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
sent Arg-I
automatically Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
system Arg-I
to Arg-I
personal Arg-I
phones Arg-I
or Arg-I
email Arg-I
addresses Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
generally Arg-I
known Arg-I
as Arg-I
spam Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
causes Arg-I
discomfort Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
annoyance Arg-I
to Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
advertising Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
very Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
every Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
campaign Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
done Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
and Arg-I
brings Arg-I
good Arg-I
results Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
believed Arg-I
by Arg-I
many Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
financial Arg-I
burden Arg-I
to Arg-I
businesses Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
after O
analyzing O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
of O
advertising O
, O
both O
of O
the O
views O
have O
strong O
support O
, O
but O
it O
is O
felt O
that O
more Arg-B
good Arg-I
comes Arg-I
from Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
than Arg-I
bad Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
idea Arg-I
that Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
supported Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
better O
for O
children O
to O
grow O
up O
in O
the O
countryside O
than O
in O
a O
big O
city O
? O

Nowadays O
living O
is O
possible O
on O
every O
place O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
still O
there O
are O
some O
differences O
among O
them O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
big Arg-B
cities Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
bringing Arg-I
up Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
education Arg-B
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
countrysides Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
my Arg-I
country Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
universities Arg-I
and Arg-I
institutes Arg-I
are Arg-I
located Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
todays Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
past Arg-I
their Arg-I
first Arg-I
earlier Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
acknowledged Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
creational Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
are Arg-I
built Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
cities Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
entertainment Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
playgrounds Arg-B
, Arg-I
parks Arg-I
, Arg-I
science Arg-I
museums Arg-I
, Arg-I
cinemas Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in Arg-B
countrysides Arg-I
we Arg-I
hardly Arg-I
ever Arg-I
see Arg-I
creational Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
who Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
countrysides Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
pass Arg-I
their Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
farms Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
in Arg-B
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
children Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
media Arg-I
easily Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
things Arg-I
by Arg-I
watching Arg-I
television Arg-I
and Arg-I
surfing Arg-I
through Arg-I
the Arg-I
net Arg-I
. O

Via Arg-B
internet Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
connection Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
children Arg-I
all Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
, O
therefor O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
exchange Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
although O
countrysides Arg-B
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
fresh Arg-I
air Arg-I
, Arg-I
peace Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Today Arg-B
's Arg-I
children Arg-I
needs Arg-I
somethings Arg-I
to Arg-I
entertain Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
occupy Arg-I
their Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

A O
single O
international O
language O
or O
not O
? O

The O
21st O
century O
has O
witnessed O
the O
sweeping O
trends O
of O
globalization O
, O
which O
raises O
people O
's O
concerns O
about O
whether O
a O
single O
international O
language O
should O
be O
a O
necessity O
or O
not O
. O

From O
my O
perspective O
, O
a Arg-B
universal Arg-I
language Arg-I
playing Arg-I
the Arg-I
dominant Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
international Arg-I
community Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
vital Arg-I
significance Arg-I
to Arg-I
global Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
especially O
true O
if O
we O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
a Arg-B
single Arg-I
international Arg-I
language Arg-I
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
pivotal Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
global Arg-I
economic Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
businessmen Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
countries Arg-I
have Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
and Arg-I
deeply Arg-I
on Arg-I
trade Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
intensify Arg-I
the Arg-I
transnational Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
without Arg-B
the Arg-I
availability Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
that Arg-I
misunderstanding Arg-I
and Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
would Arg-I
ensue Arg-I
over Arg-I
business Arg-I
negotiations Arg-I
, Arg-I
impeding Arg-I
collaborations Arg-I
between Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
a Arg-B
single Arg-I
international Arg-I
language Arg-I
serves Arg-I
an Arg-I
economic Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
a Arg-B
universal Arg-I
language Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
integral Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
communication Arg-I
and Arg-I
interactions Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
single Arg-I
international Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
tell Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
smoothly Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
countries Arg-I
' Arg-I
specific Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
customs Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
enables Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
expand Arg-I
their Arg-I
outlooks Arg-I
, Arg-I
viewing Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
in Arg-I
new Arg-I
angles Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
people Arg-I
travel Arg-I
to Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
introduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
to Arg-I
such Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
command Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
universal Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
helping Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
have Arg-I
an Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
exotic Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

In O
spite O
of O
this O
, O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O
a O
universal O
language O
can O
not O
be O
denied O
. O

To O
be O
more O
specific O
, O
a Arg-B
single Arg-I
international Arg-I
language Arg-I
may Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
extent Arg-I
, Arg-I
erode Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
identity Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
nation Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
people Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
impressed Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
values Arg-I
brought Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
universal Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
eroding Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
national Arg-I
belong Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
some Arg-B
Asians Arg-I
are Arg-I
seeking Arg-I
individualism Arg-I
, Arg-I
previously Arg-I
denied Arg-I
by Arg-I
many Arg-I
Asian Arg-I
countries Arg-I
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
identified Arg-I
with Arg-I
such Arg-I
values Arg-I
expressed Arg-I
in Arg-I
American Arg-I
movies Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
imported Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
governments Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
result Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
proliferation Arg-I
of Arg-I
English Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
a Arg-B
single Arg-I
international Arg-I
language Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
global Arg-I
community Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
economic Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
every Arg-B
country Arg-I
should Arg-I
by Arg-I
no Arg-I
means Arg-I
disregard Arg-I
the Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
heritage Arg-I

Roles O
of O
international O
sports O
events O

Whenever O
an O
international O
sporting O
occasion O
like O
the O
football O
World O
Cup O
takes O
place O
, O
it O
attracts O
millions O
of O
people O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

As O
sport O
has O
become O
a O
common O
passion O
which O
passed O
over O
every O
national O
border O
, O
popular Arg-B
sports Arg-I
events Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
international Arg-I
tensions Arg-I
remarkably Arg-I
and Arg-I
promote Arg-I
national Arg-I
prides Arg-I
safely Arg-I
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
sports Arg-B
events Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
chances Arg-I
for Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
from Arg-I
one Arg-I
another Arg-I
so O
that O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
results Arg-I
, Arg-I
break Arg-I
records Arg-I
and Arg-I
bring Arg-I
victories Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Because O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
gather Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
host Arg-I
city Arg-I
for Arg-I
sport Arg-I
events Arg-I
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
good Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
discovering Arg-I
different Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
sport Arg-B
events Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
of Arg-I
healthiness Arg-I
, Arg-I
honesty Arg-I
and Arg-I
fairness Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
strengthen Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
, Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
and Arg-I
solidarity Arg-I
among Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
sharing Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
but Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
moments Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
competition Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
competitors Arg-I
often Arg-I
shake Arg-I
hands Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
and Arg-I
congratulate Arg-I
the Arg-I
winners Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
among Arg-I
nations Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
sporting Arg-B
occasions Arg-I
play Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
raising Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
in Arg-I
both Arg-I
athletes Arg-I
and Arg-I
spectators Arg-I
. O

Seeing Arg-B
national Arg-I
flags Arg-I
be Arg-I
honored Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
emotional Arg-I
moments Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
athlete Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
athlete Arg-I
also Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
he Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
beloved Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
witnessing Arg-I
our Arg-I
national Arg-I
flags Arg-I
flying Arg-I
proudly Arg-I
among Arg-I
others Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
can Arg-I
stop Arg-I
hiding Arg-I
our Arg-I
pride Arg-I
and Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when Arg-B
Vietnam Arg-I
became Arg-I
the Arg-I
champion Arg-I
of Arg-I
SEAGAMES Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
2008 Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
festival Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
permeated Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
streets Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
ages Arg-I
turned Arg-I
out Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
streets Arg-I
with Arg-I
flags Arg-I
, Arg-I
banners Arg-I
and Arg-I

they Arg-I
sang Arg-I
aloud Arg-I
songs Arg-I
of Arg-I
Ho Arg-I
Chi Arg-I
Minh Arg-I
President Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
eager Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
lasted Arg-I
many Arg-I
next Arg-I
days Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some Arg-B
hooligans Arg-I
were Arg-I
so Arg-I
excited Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
took Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
motor Arg-I
racing Arg-I
or Arg-I
using Arg-I
fireworks Arg-I
illegally Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
hooligans Arg-I
only Arg-I
took Arg-I
a Arg-I
minority Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
sport Arg-B
events Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
wake Arg-I
up Arg-I
love Arg-I
and Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
citizen Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
international Arg-B
sporting Arg-I
occasions Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
effective Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
to Arg-I
tensions Arg-I
among Arg-I
nations Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
stimulant Arg-I
for Arg-I
releasing Arg-I
patriotic Arg-I
emotions Arg-I
safely Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
recommend O
that O
big O
sports O
events O
should O
be O
held O
more O
frequently O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Children O
engagement O
in O
paid O
work O

In O
many O
countries O
, O
children O
are O
educated O
from O
their O
young O
age O
to O
be O
independent O
and O
responsible O
for O
their O
actions O
. O

Their O
parents O
allow O
them O
to O
take O
some O
jobs O
because O
these O
jobs O
can O
help O
them O
learn O
and O
take O
responsibilities O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
educational O
measure O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the Arg-B
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
children Arg-I
engagement Arg-I
in Arg-I
paid Arg-I
work Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
children Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
hardship Arg-I
of Arg-I
earning Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
they Arg-I
take Arg-I
some Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
paid Arg-I
work Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
looking Arg-I
after Arg-I
babies Arg-I
, Arg-I
doing Arg-I
housework Arg-I
and Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
shops Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
life Arg-I
experience Arg-I
and Arg-I
skills Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
mature Arg-I
and Arg-I
can Arg-I
deal Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
different Arg-I
situations Arg-I
in Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
' Arg-I
hardship Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
respect Arg-I
values Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
form Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
habit Arg-I
of Arg-I
saving Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
when Arg-B
children Arg-I
take Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
responsible O
because O
whether Arg-B
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
earn Arg-I
money Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
will Arg-I
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
and Arg-I
attitudes Arg-I
in Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
keep Arg-I
their Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
children Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
their Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
their Arg-I
duties Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
works Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
shop Arg-I
assistant Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
an Arg-I
eye Arg-I
on Arg-I
good Arg-I
and Arg-I
products Arg-I
, Arg-I
calculate Arg-I
prices Arg-I
correctly Arg-I
and Arg-I
take Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
for Arg-I
any Arg-I
lost Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
children Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
material Arg-I
, Arg-I
neglect Arg-I
their Arg-I
study Arg-I
for Arg-I
earning Arg-I
money Arg-I
or Arg-I
be Arg-I
exploited Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
employers Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
if Arg-B
children Arg-I
get Arg-I
good Arg-I
care Arg-I
and Arg-I
instructions Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
take Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
going Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
if Arg-B
children Arg-I
take Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
paid Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
' Arg-I
permission Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
lively Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
mature Arg-I
and Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
. O

I O
recommend O
that O
parents O
should O
help O
their O
children O
to O
choose O
a O
suitable O
job O
which O
does O
not O
affect O
their O
children O
's O
study O
and O
that O
the O
government O
should O
have O
right O
policies O
to O
avoid O
exploiting O
children O
's O
labour O
. O

Jury O
must O
have O
access O
to O
criminals O
' O
past O
records O
Courts O
of O
many O
countries O
provide O
a O
jury O
with O
the O
history O
of O
a O
defendant O
, O
except O
those O
of O
the O
UK O
and O
Australia O
. O

Common O
belief O
that O
a O
jury O
should O
obtain O
all O
information O
regarding O
a O
suspect O
has O
fostered O
some O
lawyers O
to O
protest O
against O
the O
current O
rules O
in O
those O
two O
countries O
. O

Many O
people O
hold O
the O
opinion O
that O
past Arg-B
behaviour Arg-I
determines Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
actions Arg-I
, O
which O
could O
be O
the O
main O
reason O
to O
support O
the O
idea O
of O
revealing O
the O
record O
to O
the O
jury O
. O

We O
must O
acknowledge O
that O
complete Arg-B
data Arg-I
concerning Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
sued Arg-I
person Arg-I
creates Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
for Arg-I
jury Arg-I
members Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
an Arg-I
overall Arg-I
picture Arg-I
of Arg-I
defendant Arg-I
's Arg-I
personality Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
past Arg-B
record Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
useful Arg-I
to Arg-I
decide Arg-I
whether Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
was Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
perform Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
concerns Arg-I
serious Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
kidnapping Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
murder Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
in Arg-B
order Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
jury Arg-I
to Arg-I
come Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
an Arg-I
objective Arg-I
decision Arg-I
not Arg-I
depending Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
court Arg-I
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
with Arg-I
details Arg-I
relevant Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
case Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a Arg-B
defendant Arg-I
with Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
past Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
found Arg-I
guilty Arg-I
compared Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
with Arg-I
no Arg-I
or Arg-I
lighter Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
record Arg-I
. O

Innocent Arg-B
suspects Arg-I
, Arg-I
eventually Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
face Arg-I
unfair Arg-I
juridical Arg-I
decision Arg-I
and Arg-I
pay Arg-I
twice Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
previous Arg-I
inadequate Arg-I
actions Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I Arg-B
am Arg-I
skeptical Arg-I
about Arg-I
disclosing Arg-I
the Arg-I
defendant Arg-I
's Arg-I
history Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
jury Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
intention Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
subjective Arg-I
and Arg-I
probable Arg-I
inaccurate Arg-I
verdict Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I Arg-B
strongly Arg-I
support Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
laws Arg-I
of Arg-I
Great Arg-I
Britain Arg-I
and Arg-I
Australia Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
change Arg-I
the Arg-I
regulations Arg-I
on Arg-I
keeping Arg-I
the Arg-I
jury Arg-I
unaware Arg-I
of Arg-I
past Arg-I
actions Arg-I
. O

The O
Internet O
is O
an O
adequate O
source O
of O
academic O
information O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
decades O
, O
the O
world O
has O
witnessed O
a O
long O
stride O
in O
technological O
modernization O
, O
especially O
in O
field O
of O
education O

This O
has O
enabled O
university O
lecturers O
to O
post O
their O
lessons O
on O
the O
web O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
students O
. O

Consequently O
, O
direct O
interactions O

have O
been O
deemphasized O

However O
, O
the O
impact O

on O

is O
still O
an O
intriguing O
issue O
which O
has O
sparked O
a O
heated O
debate O
among O
educationists O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
Internet Arg-I
will Arg-I
pave Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
accessible Arg-I
and Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
the Arg-B
Internet Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
adequate Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
academic Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
potentially Arg-I
fulfill Arg-I
the Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
university Arg-I
pupils Arg-I
. O

Nowadays Arg-B
, Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I

As O
such O

the Arg-B

grown Arg-I

the Arg-I

Moreover O

with Arg-B

no Arg-I

College Arg-B

save Arg-I
their Arg-I
time Arg-I
browsing Arg-I

necessary Arg-I

Last O
but O
not O

, O
the Arg-B
Internet Arg-I
offers Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
effective Arg-I

practical Arg-I
method Arg-I
of Arg-I

While Arg-B

In O
the O

the Arg-B

an Arg-I

for O
the O
enormous O

Have Arg-B
you Arg-I

This Arg-B
fairy Arg-I

out Arg-I

true Arg-I
thanks Arg-I
to Arg-I
technical Arg-I

Critics O
may O

that O
the Arg-B

have Arg-I
several Arg-I

for Arg-I

wrong Arg-I
approach Arg-I
towards Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
itself Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
what Arg-B
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
change Arg-I
in Arg-I
learners Arg-I
' Arg-I
attitude Arg-I
not Arg-I
an Arg-I
elimination Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
from Arg-I
academic Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

After O
analyzing O
both O
points O
of O
view O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
reiterate Arg-I
the Arg-I
necessity Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
benefits O
of O
the O
Internet O
undoubtedly O
outweigh O
its O
disadvantages O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
the O
matter O
of O
help O
or O
hindrance O
, O
it O
is O
the O
way O
you O
use O
the O
cyberspace O

Be O
wise O
and O
conscious O
. O

Early O
retirement O
for O
55 O
+ O
employees O
to O
help O
younger O
people O

Nowadays O
the O
discussion O
about O
whether O
the O
businesses O
are O
supposed O
to O
prescribe O
the O
retirement O
age O
at O
fifty O
- O
five O
to O
offer O
more O
job O
vacancies O
for O
younger O
generation O
has O
become O
a O
controversy O
. O

Some O
believe O
that O
is O
a O
perfect O
attempt O
to O
support O
the O
young O
, O
others O
claim O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
encouraging Arg-B
the Arg-I
workers Arg-I
to Arg-I
retire Arg-I
at Arg-I
age Arg-I
of Arg-I
fifty Arg-I
- Arg-I
five Arg-I
to Arg-I
release Arg-I
the Arg-I
positions Arg-I
for Arg-I
younger Arg-I
job Arg-I
seekers Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
merits Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
fresh Arg-B
graduates Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
practical Arg-I
and Arg-I
applicable Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
current Arg-I
needs Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
organisation Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
instilled Arg-I
and Arg-I
imparted Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
updated Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
skills Arg-I
at Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
having Arg-B
a Arg-I
larger Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
young Arg-I
adults Arg-I
could Arg-I
enhance Arg-I
the Arg-I
working Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
and Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
. O

Compared Arg-B
with Arg-I
aged Arg-I
staffs Arg-I
, Arg-I
younger Arg-I
employees Arg-I
are Arg-I
often Arg-I
physically Arg-I
stronger Arg-I
and Arg-I
energetic Arg-I
which Arg-I
enables Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
carry Arg-I
out Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
workload Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
deadline Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
sacrificing Arg-B
the Arg-I
senior Arg-I
members Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
workers Arg-I
poses Arg-I
several Arg-I
negative Arg-I
influences Arg-I
. O

From Arg-B
personal Arg-I
level Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
fosters Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
unfairness Arg-I
between Arg-I
the Arg-I
older Arg-I
and Arg-I
younger Arg-I
generations Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
every Arg-B
person Arg-I
within Arg-I
the Arg-I
business Arg-I
enterprise Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
rights Arg-I
to Arg-I
proceed Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
capable Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
it Arg-I
, Arg-I
disregard Arg-I
the Arg-I
age Arg-I
and Arg-I
physical Arg-I
capacity Arg-I
. O

From Arg-B
social Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
, Arg-I
massively Arg-I
forcing Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
retirement Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
financial Arg-I
burden Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
sufficient Arg-B
pension Arg-I
payments Arg-I
and Arg-I
regular Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
given Arg-I
and Arg-I
arranged Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
senior Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
after Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
imposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
terminate Arg-I
their Arg-I
employment Arg-I
permanently Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
even O
though O
the Arg-B
introduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
retirement Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
, O
it O
is O
convincing O
that O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
generate Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
among Arg-I
different Arg-I
age Arg-I
groups Arg-I
and Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
financial Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
accordingly Arg-I
. O

Can O
technology O
alone O
solve O
the O
world O
's O
environmental O
problems O
? O

It O
is O
irrefutable O
that O
progress O
in O
technology O
leads O
to O
environmental O
problems O
. O

Some O
individuals O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
if O
people O
live O
a O
simple O
life O
and O
do O
not O
use O
the O
things O
that O
technology O
has O
brought O
us O
then O
these O
problems O
can O
be O
solved O
whereas O
others O
opine O
that O
only O
technology O
can O
solve O
these O
problems O
. O

In O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
, O
I O
intend O
to O
discuss O
both O
viewpoints O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
that O
if Arg-B
humans Arg-I
stop Arg-I
using Arg-I
technology Arg-I
and Arg-I
lead Arg-I
a Arg-I
simple Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
then Arg-I
only Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

They O
argue O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
luxuries Arg-I
people Arg-I
use Arg-I
which Arg-I
damages Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
use Arg-I
air Arg-I
conditioners Arg-I
, Arg-I
automobiles Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
such Arg-I
things Arg-I
that Arg-I
technology Arg-I
has Arg-I
brought Arg-I
us Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
naturally Arg-I
there Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
like Arg-I
fossil Arg-I
fuels Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
saved Arg-I
and Arg-I
all Arg-I
this Arg-I
would Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
there O
are O
people O
who O
say O
that O
technology Arg-B
alone Arg-I
could Arg-I
save Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

They O
opine O
that O
now Arg-B
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
come Arg-I
so Arg-I
far Arg-I
ahead Arg-I
in Arg-I
technology Arg-I
that Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
going Arg-I
back Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
ask Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
jet Arg-I
age Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
age Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
bullock Arg-I
cart Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
advances Arg-I
going Arg-I
on Arg-I
technology Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
helping Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
prime Arg-I
example Arg-I
is Arg-I
finding Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
to Arg-I
water Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
developing Arg-I
countries Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Africa Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
pressurising Arg-I
sea Arg-I
water Arg-I
to Arg-I
produce Arg-I
vapour Arg-I
jets Arg-I
and Arg-I
filtering Arg-I
them Arg-I
through Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
nano Arg-I
tubes Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
clean Arg-I
drinking Arg-I
water Arg-I
from Arg-I
sea Arg-I
water Arg-I
- Arg-I
an Arg-I
almost Arg-I
inexhaustible Arg-I
resource Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Japan Arg-B
is Arg-I
working Arg-I
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
working Arg-I
space Arg-I
solar Arg-I
power Arg-I
system Arg-I
by Arg-I
2030 Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
drawing Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
colossal Arg-I
energy Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
sun Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
could Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
electricity Arg-I
requirements Arg-I
indefinitely Arg-I
without Arg-I
nuclear Arg-I
or Arg-I
GHG Arg-I
emissions Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
successful Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
impact Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
monumental Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
would Arg-I
mean Arg-I
energy Arg-I
for Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
hospitals Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
homes Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
would Arg-I
mean Arg-I
another Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
revolution Arg-I
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
pen O
down O
saying O
that O
, O
technology Arg-B
alone Arg-I
can Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
's Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

We O
are O
finally O
entering O
an O
era O
where O
engineering O
and O
technology O
are O
making O
the O
world O
a O
better O
place O
. O

It O
would O
be O
highly O
unpractical O
to O
ask O
people O
to O
adopt O
a O
simpler O
way O
of O
life O
. O

Computers O
replace O
human O
teachers O
With O
the O
number O
of O
technological O
advances O
growing O
apace O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
Internet O
and O
computers O
will O
supplant O
the O
traditional O
role O
of O
teachers O
in O
a O
not O
too O
distant O
future O
. O

This O
idea O
may O
point O
out O
to O
two O
main O
directions O
, O
both O
of O
which O
present O
different O
arguments O
. O

Central O
to O
the O
supporting O
arguments O
of O
this O
issue O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
the Arg-B
global Arg-I
online Arg-I
network Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
inexhaustible Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
exceeds Arg-I
the Arg-I
fund Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
that Arg-I
any Arg-I
veteran Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
can Arg-I
accumulate Arg-I
. O

Internet Arg-B
and Arg-I
computer Arg-I
also Arg-I
offer Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
comprehensive Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
ranging Arg-I
from Arg-I
visual Arg-I
to Arg-I
aural Arg-I
stimuli Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
learning Arg-I
an Arg-I
ever Arg-I
enjoyable Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
critics O
of O
this O
idea O
maintain O
that O
although O
the O
educational O
benefits O
that O
the O
Internet O
may O
yield O
are O
undeniable O
, O
there O
still O
remain O
certain O
shortcomings O
. O

Much Arg-B
information Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
may Arg-I
provide Arg-I
, Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
sources Arg-I
are Arg-I
unjustified Arg-I
by Arg-I
experts Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
information Arg-B
from Arg-I
those Arg-I
sources Arg-I
is Arg-I
subject Arg-I
to Arg-I
question Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
the Arg-B
computer Arg-I
can Arg-I
show Arg-I
whether Arg-I
an Arg-I
answer Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
question Arg-I
is Arg-I
right Arg-I
or Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
but O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
in Arg-I
- Arg-I
depth Arg-I
explanation Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
can Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
pinpoint Arg-I
the Arg-I
weaknesses Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
student Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
, Arg-I
adjusting Arg-I
and Arg-I
tailoring Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
methodology Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
the Arg-I
levels Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
demands Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
where Arg-I
the Arg-I
computer Arg-I
proves Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
incompetent Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
although O
both O
sides O
have O
their O
equally O
valid O
arguments O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
although O
Internet Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
useful Arg-I
tool Arg-I
for Arg-I
education Arg-I
, O
at Arg-B
no Arg-I
time Arg-I
will Arg-I
the Arg-I
unique Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
human Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
be Arg-I
replaced Arg-I
. O

One O
or O
two O
close O
friends O
vs. O
a O
large O
number O
of O
casual O
acquaintances O

There O
is O
no O
need O
for O
me O
to O
put O
any O
emphasis O
on O
the O
advantage O
of O
having O
a O
large O
number O
of O
casual O
acquaintance O
. O

However O
, O
I O
still O
agree O
that O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
one Arg-I
or Arg-I
two Arg-I
close Arg-I
friends Arg-I
than Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
casual Arg-I
acquaintances Arg-I
. O

We O
can O
not O
deny O
that O
being Arg-B
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
with Arg-I
someone Arg-I
is Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
only Arg-I
being Arg-I
acquaintant Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
not Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
friend Arg-I
with Arg-I
anyone Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
friends Arg-B
are Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
compatibility Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
two Arg-I
years Arg-I
in Arg-I
college Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
found Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
differences Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
than Arg-I
similarities Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
growing Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
different Arg-I
families Arg-I
and Arg-I
was Arg-I
educated Arg-I
in Arg-I
various Arg-I
ways Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
acquaintances Arg-I
are Arg-I
just Arg-I
acquaintances Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
together Arg-I
but Arg-I
we Arg-I
could Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
friend Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
casual Arg-I
acquaintances Arg-I
than Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
close Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
close Arg-B
friends Arg-I
can Arg-I
easily Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
. O

Because O
of O
the O
similarity O
I O
talked O
before O
, O
acquaintances Arg-B
probably Arg-I
not Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
you Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
your Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
even Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
your Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
. O

Everyone Arg-B
play Arg-I
the Arg-I
role Arg-I
of Arg-I
acquaintance Arg-I
and Arg-I
friend Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Being Arg-B
friendly Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
treat Arg-I
a Arg-I
acquaintance Arg-I
but Arg-I
way Arg-I
not Arg-I
enough Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
is Arg-I
sick Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
ask Arg-I
if Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
okay Arg-I
like Arg-I
an Arg-I
acquaintance Arg-I
but Arg-I
do Arg-I
my Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
him Arg-I
get Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
is Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
direction Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
life Arg-I
trail Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
my Arg-I
best Arg-I
to Arg-I
pull Arg-I
him Arg-I
back Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
not Arg-I
stand Arg-I
and Arg-I
stare Arg-I
like Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
not Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

And O
I O
believe O
my Arg-B
friend Arg-I
will Arg-I
do Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
a Arg-B
friend Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
you Arg-I
care Arg-I
about Arg-I
. O

To O
me O
, O
friends Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
second Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

I O
am O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
has O
only O
one O
or O
two O
close O
friends O
, O
and O
I O
am O
fully O
content O
that O
I O
have O
such O
nice O
friends O
. O

If O
someone O
exchange O
my O
friends O
with O
thousands O
of O
acquaintances O
, O
I O
will O
definitely O
say O
NO O
. O

Living O
in O
a O
higher O
pace O
is O
better O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
people O
have O
to O
live O
at O
a O
higher O
or O
lower O
pace O
, O
and O
this O
topic O
can O
also O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O
. O

Some O
people O
tend O
to O
be O
hurry O
to O
complete O
their O
tasks O
, O
while O
others O
seem O
to O
prefer O
the O
opposite O
position O
. O

After O
deeply O
pondering O
over O
this O
issue O
, O
I O
also O
develop O
my O
own O
perspective O
. O

I O
favor O
the O
former O
; O
that O
is O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
pace Arg-I
condition Arg-I
. O

The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
we Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
accomplishing Arg-I
some Arg-I
important Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
fitting Arg-I
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
found Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
experience Arg-I
of Arg-I
missing Arg-I
exam Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
just Arg-I
failed Arg-I
to Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
entrance Arg-I
exam Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
thought Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
eating Arg-I
breakfast Arg-I
and Arg-I
transporting Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
testing Arg-I
place Arg-I
; Arg-I
while Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
stocked Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
missed Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
test Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
start O
to O
agree O
that O
we Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
eager Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
another O
equally O
important O
aspect O
is O
keeping Arg-B
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
pace Arg-I
condition Arg-I
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
me Arg-I
from Arg-I
getting Arg-I
lazy Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
being Arg-I
a Arg-I
sluggish Arg-I
person Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
probability Arg-I
of Arg-I
fulfilling Arg-I
my Arg-I
dream Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
had Arg-I
spent Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
practicing Arg-I
playing Arg-I
piano Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
won Arg-I
a Arg-I
piano Arg-I
competition Arg-I
, Arg-I
defeating Arg-I
those Arg-I
spending Arg-I
less Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
practicing Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
keeping Arg-B
our Arg-I
pace Arg-I
higher Arg-I
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
people O
proclaiming O
that O
with Arg-B
a Arg-I
slower Arg-I
pace Arg-I
can Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
lives Arg-I
more Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
notice Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
control Arg-I
or Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
fame Arg-I
of Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
from O
my O
limited O
understanding O
, O
I O
just O
doubt O
the O
credibility O
of O
that O
saying O
. O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
those Arg-I
people Arg-I
with Arg-I
slower Arg-I
pace Arg-I
losing Arg-I
the Arg-I
piano Arg-I
competition Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
really Arg-I
happy Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
really Arg-I
joyful Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
immerse Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
joy Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
victory Arg-I
and Arg-I
accomplishment Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
the O
reasons O
demonstrated O
above O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
higher Arg-I
pace Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
are Arg-I
qualitatively Arg-I
greater Arg-I
than Arg-I
that Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
opposite Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
not O
to O
say O
, O
of O
course O
that O
other O
points O
of O
view O
are O
totally O
without O
merit O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
am O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
reasons O
I O
proposed O
in O
favor O
of O
my O
own O
sentiment O
are O
much O
more O
tenable O
and O
plausible O
. O

Teachers O

vs O
other O

The O
way O
in O
which O
children O
today O
study O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
any O
previous O
generations O
, O
and O
the O
increased O
availability O
and O
relatively O
low O
price O
of O
modern O
technology O
has O
been O
instrumental O
in O
this O

. O

Despite O
the O
argument O
of O
some O
people O
that O
learners Arg-B
can Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
more Arg-I
useful Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
from Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
than Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
sources Arg-I
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
both Arg-B
alternative Arg-I
sources Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
methods Arg-I
from Arg-I
educators Arg-I
are Arg-I
equally Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
acquisition Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the Arg-B
widespread Arg-I
of Arg-I
alternative Arg-I
sources Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
has Arg-I
played Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
acquisition Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Computers Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
programmed Arg-I
to Arg-I
provide Arg-I
an Arg-I
endless Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
questions Arg-I
in Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
fields Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
answer Arg-I
these Arg-I
questions Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
facts Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
learned Arg-I
and Arg-I
reinforced Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
case Arg-I
in Arg-I
point Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
reading Arg-I
and Arg-I
listening Arg-I
parts Arg-I
of Arg-I
TOEFL Arg-I
iBT Arg-I
exams Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
candidates Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
answer Arg-I
many Arg-I
questions Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
limited Arg-I
period Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
when Arg-B
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
academic Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
post Arg-I
those Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
websites Arg-I
and Arg-I
receive Arg-I
correct Arg-I
answers Arg-I
from Arg-I
unknown Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
faraway Arg-I
places Arg-I
without Arg-I
any Arg-I
costs Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
conducting Arg-I
a Arg-I
research Arg-I
require Arg-I
long Arg-I
hours Arg-I
of Arg-I
searching Arg-I
in Arg-I
library Arg-I
shelves Arg-I
, Arg-I
now Arg-I
all Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
done Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
click Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
button Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
technologies Arg-B
are Arg-I
vital Arg-I
in Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
schools Arg-B
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
are Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
students Arg-I
gather Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
educated Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
from Arg-I
each Arg-I
others Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
formal Arg-I
educators Arg-I
. O

At Arg-B
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
development Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
orchestrated Arg-I
stage Arg-I
by Arg-I
stage Arg-I
, Arg-I
step Arg-I
by Arg-I
step Arg-I
by Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
acquisition Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
is Arg-I
guided Arg-I
and Arg-I
backed Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
systematic Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
formal Arg-B
education Arg-I
approaches Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
indispensable Arg-I
. O

To O
put O
it O
all O
in O
a O
nutshell O
, O
I O
pen O
out O
saying O
that O
alternative Arg-B
sources Arg-I
information Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
education Arg-I
systems Arg-I
are Arg-I
equally Arg-I
important Arg-I
in Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

So O
students O
should O
learn O
both O
from O
their O
teachers O
as O
well O
as O
modern O
technology O
to O
gain O
the O
best O

Protect O
animals O
or O
not O
? O

Many O
animals O
today O
are O
in O
danger O
of O
extinction O
owing O
to O
various O
reasons O
. O

While O
some O
people O
believe O
it O
is O
important O
to O
protect O
these O
endangered O
species O
, O
others O
argue O
that O
problems O
of O
human O
beings O
deserve O
more O
attention O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
give Arg-I
priority Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
issues Arg-I
. O

Animal O
protectionists O
may O
base O
their O
argument O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
biodiversity Arg-B
is Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
the Arg-I
balance Arg-I
of Arg-I
ecosystem Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
certain Arg-I
species Arg-I
are Arg-I
absent Arg-I
from Arg-I
this Arg-I
system Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
balance Arg-I
is Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
disrupted Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
species Arg-I
, Arg-I
including Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
come Arg-I
under Arg-I
threat Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
our Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
as Arg-I
many Arg-I
species Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
species Arg-B
extinction Arg-I
is Arg-I
quite Arg-I
natural Arg-I
according Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
theory Arg-I
of Arg-I
evolution Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
environment Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
transformed Arg-I
many Arg-I
times Arg-I
since Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
species Arg-I
came Arg-I
into Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
great Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
plants Arg-I
and Arg-I
animals Arg-I
died Arg-I
out Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
were Arg-I
unable Arg-I
to Arg-I
fit Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

On O
most O
occasions O
, O
the Arg-B
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
extinction Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
species Arg-I
is Arg-I
irrevocable Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
nothing Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
human Arg-B
beings Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
are Arg-I
still Arg-I
faced Arg-I
with Arg-I
many Arg-I
urgent Arg-I
problems Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
starvation Arg-I
, Arg-I
disease Arg-I
and Arg-I
wars Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
these Arg-I
problems Arg-I
are Arg-I
taken Arg-I
into Arg-I
account Arg-I
, Arg-I
extinction Arg-I
of Arg-I
some Arg-I
animals Arg-I
recedes Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
in Arg-I
importance Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
sensible Arg-I
to Arg-I
devote Arg-I
our Arg-I
limited Arg-I
resources Arg-I
to Arg-I
animals Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
past Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
should Arg-I
put Arg-I
our Arg-I
own Arg-I
survival Arg-I
and Arg-I
sustainment Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
first Arg-I
before Arg-I
considering Arg-I
the Arg-I
conservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
species Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
more Arg-B
emphasis Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
laid Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
other Arg-I
than Arg-I
animals Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
let Arg-I
nature Arg-I
take Arg-I
its Arg-I
course Arg-I
with Arg-I
regard Arg-I
to Arg-I
species Arg-I
extinction Arg-I

, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
advanced Arg-I
medical Arg-I

brings Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
main Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
high Arg-I
- Arg-I
tech Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
better Arg-I
taken Arg-I
care Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
economy Arg-I
because O
healthy Arg-B
workers Arg-I
can Arg-I
create Arg-I
more Arg-I
productivity Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
in Arg-I
health Arg-I
checking Arg-I
or Arg-I
treatment Arg-I
so O
this Arg-B
saves Arg-I
an Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
cost Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a Arg-B
community Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
elderly Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
health Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
major Arg-I
role Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
sustainable Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

In O
facts O
, O
young Arg-B
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
as Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
grandparents Arg-I
are Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the Arg-B
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
medical Arg-I
care Arg-I
makes Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
life Arg-I
for Arg-I
all Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O
people O
maintain O
that O
the Arg-B
increase Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
expectancy Arg-I
puts Arg-I
a Arg-I
high Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
system Arg-I
because O
more Arg-B
pension Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
for Arg-I
Medicare Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
investing Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
economic Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

Although O
it O
is O
real O
in O
some O
aspects O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
capital Arg-I
that Arg-I
spend Arg-I
on Arg-I
taking Arg-I
care Arg-I
the Arg-I
elderly Arg-I
is Arg-I
contributed Arg-I
by Arg-I
these Arg-I
people Arg-I
during Arg-I
their Arg-I
working Arg-I
time Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
worth Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
good Arg-I
care Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
have Arg-I
given Arg-I
their Arg-I
effort Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
governments Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
the Arg-I
Medicare Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

By O
way O
of O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the Arg-B
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
system Arg-I
helps Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I

It Arg-B
helps Arg-I
people Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
sustainable Arg-I
society Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I

The O

There O
are O
many O
factors O

to O
one O

success O

However O
, O
which O
factor O
is O
the O
most O
influential O
one O
is O
open O
to O
debate O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
nowadays O
the O
assitance O
from O

is O
quite O
a O
essential O
factor O
in O
one O

success O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
one Arg-B
can Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
success Arg-I
more Arg-I
easily Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
statement O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
family Arg-B
plays Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
helping Arg-I
one Arg-I
to Arg-I
pursuit Arg-I
success Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O

First O
of O
all O
, O
more Arg-B
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
receive Arg-I

from Arg-I

Since O
our Arg-B

receive Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
than Arg-I
our Arg-I
grandparents Arg-I
did Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
more Arg-I
advices Arg-I
and Arg-I
helps Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
seldom Arg-I
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
attend Arg-I
a Arg-I
collage Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
grandparents Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
get Arg-I
a Arg-I
education Arg-I
even Arg-I
in Arg-I
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, O
so O
when Arg-B
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
had Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
in Arg-I
solving Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
his Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
for Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

Things Arg-B
have Arg-I
changed Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
grow Arg-I
up Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
condition Arg-I
than Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
did Arg-I
. O

Whenever Arg-B
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
can Arg-I
always Arg-I
ask Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
problem Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
learned Arg-I
quite Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
. O

What O
is O
more O
, O
family Arg-B
members Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
know Arg-I
what Arg-I
major Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
attend Arg-I
university Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
father Arg-I
told Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
about Arg-I
different Arg-I
majors Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
shared Arg-I
his Arg-I
own Arg-I
experience Arg-I
with Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
helped Arg-I
me Arg-I
quite Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
. O

Parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
quite Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
than Arg-I
their Arg-I
child Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
guide Arg-I
them Arg-I
toward Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
direction Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
parents Arg-B
can Arg-I
told Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
as Arg-I
many Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
. O

What Arg-B
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
is Arg-I
help Arg-I
their Arg-I
child Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
progress Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
our Arg-B
parents Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
help Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
family Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
success Arg-I
quite Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

Living O
with O
a O
roommate O
is O
better O
than O
Living O
alone O
Many O
single O
people O
have O
difficulties O
deciding O
whether O
to O
live O
with O
a O
roommate O
or O
to O
live O
alone O
. O

Each O
makes O
different O
decisions O
. O

Some O
people O
choose O
to O
live O
alone O
for O
privacy O
, O
while O
others O
choose O
to O
live O
with O
a O
roommate O
for O
practical O
reasons O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
it Arg-B
saves Arg-I
me Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
enables Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
allows Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
saves Arg-I
me Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
split Arg-I
the Arg-I
rent Arg-I
and Arg-I
utilities Arg-I
among Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
for Arg-I
less Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
last Arg-B
year Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
shared Arg-I
a Arg-I
room Arg-I
off Arg-I
- Arg-I
campus Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
decided Arg-I
to Arg-I
split Arg-I
the Arg-I
rent Arg-I
and Arg-I
heating Arg-I
bills Arg-I
into Arg-I
half Arg-I
: Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
about Arg-I
fifty Arg-I
dollars Arg-I
for Arg-I
heating Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
two Arg-I
hundred Arg-I
dollars Arg-I
for Arg-I
rent Arg-I
monthly Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
was Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
by Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
wasted Arg-I
heating Arg-I
and Arg-I
rooms Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
and Arg-I
splitting Arg-I
the Arg-I
bills Arg-I
. O

Apart O
from O
saving O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
living Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
also Arg-I
enables Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
more Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
always Arg-I
easier Arg-I
to Arg-I
socialize Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
invite Arg-I
your Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
' Arg-I
friends Arg-I
over Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
room Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
fun Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
one Arg-B
night Arg-I
, Arg-I
my Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
, Arg-I
Millan Arg-I
, Arg-I
brought Arg-I
his Arg-I
friends Arg-I
along Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
though Arg-I
his Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
were Arg-I
total Arg-I
strangers Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
got Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
soon Arg-I
found Arg-I
out Arg-I
that Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
loved Arg-I
playing Arg-I
video Arg-I
games Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
played Arg-I
a Arg-I
video Arg-I
game Arg-I
called Arg-I
' Arg-I
Halo Arg-I
' Arg-I
together Arg-I
all Arg-I
night Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
became Arg-I
good Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Living Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
made Arg-I
socializing Arg-I
much Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
living Arg-B
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
allows Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
often Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
case Arg-I
that Arg-I
your Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
skills Arg-I
or Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
you Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
run Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
ask Arg-I
your Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
something Arg-I
to Arg-I
offer Arg-I
. O

To O
illustrate O
, O
when Arg-B
my Arg-I
computer Arg-I
mysteriously Arg-I
broke Arg-I
down Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
dialed Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
manufacturer Arg-I
and Arg-I
asked Arg-I
for Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
failed Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
me Arg-I
any Arg-I
useful Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
my Arg-I
surprise Arg-I
, Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
roommates Arg-I
noticed Arg-I
my Arg-I
problems Arg-I
and Arg-I
offered Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
was Arg-I
very Arg-I
good Arg-I
with Arg-I
computers Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
he Arg-I
managed Arg-I
to Arg-I
fix Arg-I
the Arg-I
problem Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
while O
many Arg-B
people Arg-I
decide Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
alone Arg-I
for Arg-I
various Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
always Arg-I
will Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
because O
it Arg-B
offers Arg-I
me Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
less Arg-I
spending Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
socializing Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
help Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
single O
people O
should O
live O
with O
a O
roommate O
, O
if O
they O
want O
to O
enjoy O
their O
lives O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
there O
should O
be O
fixed O
punishment O
for O
each O
crime O
type O
Generally O
reason O
behind O
punishment O
is O
to O
reduce O
the O
crime O
from O
a O
nation O
and O
to O
build O
a O
fear O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
offenders O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
what O
is O
reason O
behind O
committing O
a O
crime O
therefore O
there O
should O
be O
fixed O
punishment O
for O
a O
specific O
crime O
. O

Alternatively O
I O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
should Arg-I
taken Arg-I
into Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
the Arg-I
situation Arg-I
and Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
forces Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
if Arg-B
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
fixed Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
for Arg-I
each Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
then Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
crime Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
clear Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
mind Arg-I
of Arg-I
professional Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
feel Arg-I
fear Arg-I
while Arg-I
committing Arg-I
a Arg-I
crime Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
laws Arg-B
and Arg-I
rules Arg-I
are Arg-I
there Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I

therefore O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
look Arg-I
behind Arg-I
crime Arg-I
for O
instance O

" O
a Arg-B
women Arg-I
steals Arg-I
feed Arg-I
for Arg-I
her Arg-I
child Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
treated Arg-I
same Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
women Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
steals Arg-I
for Arg-I
her Arg-I
drug Arg-I
addiction Arg-I
" O
. O

The Arg-B
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
committed Arg-I
crime Arg-I
first Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
professional Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
imprisoned Arg-I
at Arg-I
same Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
fixed Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
will Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
taken Arg-I
by Arg-I
judges Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
their Arg-I
judgement Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
effective Arg-I
economically Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
Government Arg-I
. O

Everyone Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
treated Arg-I
equally Arg-I
because O
sometimes Arg-B
we Arg-I
see Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
poor Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
much Arg-I
money Arg-I
for Arg-I
hiring Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
lawyer Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
imprisoned Arg-I
even Arg-I
without Arg-I
committing Arg-I
a Arg-I
crime Arg-I

and Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
come Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
they Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
professional Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
fixed Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
will Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
space Arg-I
between Arg-I
poor Arg-I
and Arg-I
rich Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
everyone Arg-I
will Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
Government Arg-B
should Arg-I
decide Arg-I
for Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
case Arg-I
by Arg-I
case Arg-I
basis Arg-I
. O

In O
doing O
so O
crime O
can O
be O
eliminated O
from O
a O
nation O
and O
it O
is O
a O
responsibility O
of O
every O
individual O
to O
be O
in O
the O
favor O
of O
truth O
and O
respect O
the O
laws O
of O
our O
constitution O
. O

A O
more O
convenient O
life O
in O
a O
city O

There O
are O
undeniable O
advantages O
to O
both O
life O
in O
a O
big O
city O
and O
in O
a O
small O
town O
. O

The O
former O
offers O
more O
excitement O
and O
convenience O
while O
the O
latter O
offers O
a O
cleaner O
, O
quieter O
and O
often O
friendlier O
place O
to O
live O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
advantages O
of O
small O
town O
life O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
always Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
company Arg-I
which Arg-I
locates Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
prosperous Arg-I
city Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

To O
make O
it O
convenient O
, O
I Arg-B
will Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
that Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
too Arg-I
far Arg-I
from Arg-I
my Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
more O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
life Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
so Arg-I
dull Arg-I
as Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
modern Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
visit Arg-I
museums Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
history Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
library Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
reading Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
sports Arg-I
center Arg-I
for Arg-I
exercising Arg-I
. O

But O
a Arg-B
small Arg-I
town Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
less Arg-I
developed Arg-I
to Arg-I
satisfy Arg-I
all Arg-I
these Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
needs Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
means Arg-I
more Arg-I
exposure Arg-I
to Arg-I
stimulation Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
all Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
efficiently Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
the Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
might Arg-I
come Arg-I
along Arg-I
more Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
his Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
various Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
here Arg-I

an Arg-I
there Arg-I
, Arg-I
whether Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
leaflets Arg-I
or Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
big Arg-I
screen Arg-I
showing Arg-I
things Arg-I
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
sorts Arg-I
in Arg-I
commercial Arg-I
zones Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
one Arg-I
is Arg-I
seeking Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
right Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
or Arg-I
planing Arg-I
somewhere Arg-I
to Arg-I
travel Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
just Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
buy Arg-I
a Arg-I
product Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dependable Arg-I
store Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
might Arg-I
refer Arg-I
to Arg-I
what Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
seen Arg-I
or Arg-I
heard Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
advertisements Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
relatively Arg-I
wise Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
another Arg-I
obvious Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
considering Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
receiving Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
offspring Arg-I
. O

Schools Arg-B
in Arg-I
big Arg-I
cities Arg-I
may Arg-I
receive Arg-I
more Arg-I
funds Arg-I
from Arg-I
whether Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
comities Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
with Arg-I
advanced Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
attract Arg-I
more Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Our Arg-B
children Arg-I
thus Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
pursuing Arg-I

quality Arg-I
education Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
if Arg-B
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
life Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
modern Arg-I
facilities Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
with Arg-I
more Arg-I
exposure Arg-I
to Arg-I
various Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
my Arg-I
children Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

The O
precondition O
of O
doing O
research O
by O
professors O

Nowadays O
, O
many O
professors O
conduct O
research O
while O
teaching O
in O
colleges O
or O
universities O
. O

Although O
research Arg-B
could Arg-I
bring Arg-I
funding Arg-I
and Arg-I
latest Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
research Arg-I
takes Arg-I
up Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
courses Arg-I
than Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
vital O
that O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
assist Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
professors Arg-I
’ Arg-I
duty Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
courses Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
professors Arg-I
spend Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
cut Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
on Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
courses Arg-I

is Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
may Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
quality Arg-I
of Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
reason Arg-I
why Arg-I
people Arg-I
enter Arg-I
a Arg-I
university Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
cutting Arg-I
- Arg-I
edged Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
provide Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
preparation Arg-I
courses Arg-I
to Arg-I
convey Arg-I
the Arg-I
state Arg-I
- Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
art Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
for Arg-I
college Arg-I
and Arg-I
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
professors Arg-B
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
more Arg-I
attention Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
conduct Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if Arg-B
professors Arg-I
are Arg-I
busy Arg-I
in Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
ignoring Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
courses Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
ruin Arg-I
the Arg-I
reputation Arg-I
of Arg-I
universities Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
are Arg-I
unsatisfied Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
unprepared Arg-I
course Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
enrollment Arg-I
of Arg-I
universities Arg-I
may Arg-I
decline Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
students Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
choose Arg-I
these Arg-I
kinds Arg-I
of Arg-I
universities Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
hardly Arg-B
can Arg-I
professors Arg-I
find Arg-I
assistants Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
with Arg-I
projects Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
adverse Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
academic Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Accordingly O
, O
spending Arg-B
more Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
nurture Arg-I
excellent Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
consequential Arg-I
to Arg-I
professors Arg-I
, Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
professors Arg-B
could Arg-I
teach Arg-I
students Arg-I
through Arg-I
research Arg-I
and Arg-I
projects Arg-I
. O

Some Arg-B
students Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
taking Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

Through Arg-B
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
equipment Arg-I
and Arg-I
invent Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
experience Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
electronic Arg-B
students Arg-I
always Arg-I
invent Arg-I
new Arg-I
machines Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
robots Arg-I
, Arg-I
MP3 Arg-I
and Arg-I
remote Arg-I
control Arg-I
car Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
manage Arg-I
the Arg-I
electric Arg-I
theory Arg-I
in Arg-I
practical Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

And Arg-B
some Arg-I
students Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
rewarded Arg-I
by Arg-I
investing Arg-I
new Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
only Arg-B
under Arg-I
specific Arg-I
circumstance Arg-I
, Arg-I
when Arg-I
students Arg-I
master Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
systematic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
they Arg-I
accomplish Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
requires Arg-I
professors Arg-I
provide Arg-I
high Arg-I
quality Arg-I
courses Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
word O
, O
professor Arg-B
should Arg-I
concern Arg-I
about Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
conducting Arg-B
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
for Arg-I
professors Arg-I
and Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
extent Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
precondition Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
is Arg-I
growing Arg-I
students Arg-I
’ Arg-I
solid Arg-I
theory Arg-I
fundamental Arg-I
. O

Only Arg-B
by Arg-I
developing Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
can Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
academic Arg-I
field Arg-I
. O

Professors Arg-B
could Arg-I
combine Arg-I
doing Arg-I
research Arg-I
and Arg-I
preparing Arg-I
good Arg-I
courses Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dynamic Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Apartments O
vs O
dormitories O
at O
university O
Many O
students O
prefer O
to O
live O
in O
the O
university O
dormitories O
while O
others O
prefer O
an O
apartment O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Both O
options O
have O
their O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
. O

After O
considering O
the O
level O
of O
freedom O
, O
the O
studying O
conditions O
and O
the O
economic O
factor O
, O
if O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
community Arg-I
rather Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
dormitories Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
an Arg-B
apartment Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
more Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
than Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
obey Arg-I
preset Arg-I
rules Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
you Arg-I
set Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
rules Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
are Arg-I
free Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
visits Arg-I
at Arg-I
any Arg-I
time Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
left Arg-I
alone Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
. O

An Arg-B
apartment Arg-I
offers Arg-I
more Arg-I
privacy Arg-I
because O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
room Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
sharing Arg-I
with Arg-I
another Arg-I
student Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
factor O
because O
you Arg-B
also Arg-I
get Arg-I
more Arg-I
space Arg-I
than Arg-I
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
from O
an O
economic O
point O
of O
view O
, O
people O
often O
argue O
that O
an Arg-B
apartment Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
. O

This O
is O
only O
partially O
true O
, O
you Arg-B
could Arg-I
rent Arg-I
the Arg-I
extra Arg-I
rooms Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
to Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
rent Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
. O

Transportation Arg-B
is Arg-I
another Arg-I
issue Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
and Arg-I
return Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
could Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
cheaper Arg-I
option Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
car Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
car Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
option Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
offers Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
of Arg-I
schedule Arg-I
and Arg-I
destination Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
the Arg-B
studying Arg-I
conditions Arg-I
are Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
because O
you Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
noise Arg-I
and Arg-I
distractions Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
often Arg-I
have Arg-I
in Arg-I
dormitories Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
students Arg-I
often Arg-I
complain Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
playing Arg-I
music Arg-I
too Arg-I
loud Arg-I
or Arg-I
bringing Arg-I
friends Arg-I
over Arg-I
at Arg-I
inappropriate Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

Since O
in Arg-B
an Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
, O
you Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
this Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
you Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
same O
reason O
, O
you Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
if Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
music Arg-I
, Arg-I
bring Arg-I
friends Arg-I
over Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
study Arg-I
late Arg-I
at Arg-I
night Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
set Arg-I
your Arg-I
own Arg-I
schedules Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
being Arg-I
surrounded Arg-I
by Arg-I
students Arg-I
also Arg-I
has Arg-I
some Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
being Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
help Arg-I
with Arg-I
any Arg-I
academic Arg-I
issues Arg-I
from Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
both O
options O
have O
their O
advantages O
, O
but O
personally O
I O
think O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
apartment Arg-I
outshine Arg-I
those Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
dormitory Arg-I
. O

Why O
are O
groups O
or O
organizations O
important O
to O
people O
? O

During O
our O
life O
, O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
we O
may O
be O
related O
with O
any O
groups O
or O
organizations O
; O
therefore O
, O
groups O
and O
organizations O
are O
an O
important O
part O
of O
their O
lives O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
groups Arg-B
provide Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
or Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

My O
reasons O
include O
the O
following O
: O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
humans Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
society Arg-I
includes Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
variety Arg-I
of Arg-I
groups Arg-I
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
groups Arg-I
play Arg-I
an Arg-I
essential Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
socialization Arg-I
, Arg-I
from Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
adults Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
begin Arg-I
taking Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
groups Arg-I
or Arg-I
organizations Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
days Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
especially Arg-I
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
continue Arg-I
their Arg-I
social Arg-I
participation Arg-I
in Arg-I
all Arg-I
through Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
making Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
in Arg-I
schools Arg-I
may Arg-I
learn Arg-I
to Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
along Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
university Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
likely Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
join Arg-I
student Arg-I
organization Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
major Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
expand Arg-I
their Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
or Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
graduating Arg-I
from Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
employees Arg-I
might Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
business Arg-I
associations Arg-I
for Arg-I
various Arg-I
business Arg-I
resources Arg-I
and Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
almost Arg-B
of Arg-I
us Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
groups Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
participating Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
organization Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
some Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
solid Arg-I
group Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
suited Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
provides Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
or Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
their Arg-I
horizons Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
as Arg-B
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
majoring Arg-I
in Arg-I
mass Arg-I
media Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
taken Arg-I
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
mass Arg-I
media Arg-I
student Arg-I
group Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
year Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
being Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
department Arg-I
of Arg-I
art Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
learned Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
a Arg-I
project Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
known Arg-I
some Arg-I
famous Arg-I
artists Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
term Arg-I
. O

Above O
all O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
which Arg-I
increase Arg-I
an Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
on Arg-I
my Arg-I
resume Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
sake Arg-I
of Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
groups Arg-B
and Arg-I
organizations Arg-I
would Arg-I
lead Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
action Arg-I
or Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
their Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Here O
is O
an O
example O
: O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
various Arg-I
charities Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Tzu Arg-B

organization Arg-I
in Arg-I
Taiwan Arg-I

the Arg-I
social Arg-I

community Arg-I
services Arg-I

medical Arg-I

They Arg-B
bring Arg-I
hopes Arg-I
and Arg-I
inspire Arg-I
others Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
generous Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
. O

For Arg-B
accomplishing Arg-I
their Arg-I
missions Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
charity Arg-I
should Arg-I
gather Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
volunteers Arg-I
and Arg-I
sponsors Arg-I
for Arg-I
those Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
lit Arg-I
the Arg-I
light Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
poor Arg-I
and Arg-I
victims Arg-I
; O
in O
addition O
, O
they Arg-B
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
need Arg-I
from Arg-I
all Arg-I
over Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

For O
the O
above O
reasons O
and O
examples O
, O
it O
could O
be O
widely O
thought O
that O
groups Arg-B
or Arg-I
organizations Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
vital Arg-I
part Arg-I
for Arg-I
us Arg-I
in Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
ages Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
different Arg-I
backgrounds Arg-I
. O

Should O
the O
Government O
Provide O
Free O
College O
? O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
the O
government O
should O
cover O
the O
college O
tuitions O
and O
expenses O
for O
any O
citizen O
who O
wants O
to O
go O
to O
a O
college O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
individuals Arg-B
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
their Arg-I
college Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
cost Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
's Arg-I
choice Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
fund Arg-I
a Arg-I
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
making Arg-B
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
free Arg-I
would Arg-I
cost Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
would Arg-I
divert Arg-I
public Arg-I
funds Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
needs Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
law Arg-I
enforcement Arg-I
, Arg-I
infrastructure Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
forth Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
needs Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
come Arg-I
first Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
providing Arg-I
health Arg-I
care Arg-I
to Arg-I
all Arg-I
American Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
improving Arg-I
public Arg-I
schools Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
cause Arg-I
to Arg-I
raise Arg-I
our Arg-I
taxes Arg-I
again Arg-I
and Arg-I
again Arg-I
to Arg-I
fund Arg-I
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
all Arg-I
taxpayers Arg-I
whether Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
they Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
funds Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
choice Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
college Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
everyone Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
college Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
life Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
decide Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
those Arg-B
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
financial Arg-I
investment Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
choice Arg-I
; Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Third O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
fund Arg-I
a Arg-I
college Arg-I
education Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
afford Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
their Arg-I
tuition Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
scholarship Arg-I
, Arg-I
financial Arg-I
aids Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
funds Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
already Arg-I
helps Arg-I
pay Arg-I
college Arg-I
expense Arg-I
through Arg-I
indirect Arg-I
means Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
often Arg-I
provide Arg-I
services Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
fire Arg-I
departments Arg-I
, Arg-I
medical Arg-I
assistance Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
police Arg-I
protection Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
also Arg-I
provide Arg-I
funds Arg-I
for Arg-I
academic Arg-I
research Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
the Arg-I
money Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
given Arg-I
to Arg-I
individual Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
contributions Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
trivial Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
the Arg-B
individual Arg-I
should Arg-I
finance Arg-I
his Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
education Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
personal Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

Otherwise O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
cause Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
cost Arg-I
from Arg-I
taxpayers Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
government O
. O

Where O
to O
learn O
a O
new O
language O
? O

Although O
there O
are O
some O
advantages O
to O
learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
in O
its O
original O
country O
, O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
deeper Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
language Arg-I
skills Arg-I
than Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
learn Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
languages Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Person Arg-B
' Arg-I
A Arg-I
' Arg-I
who Arg-I
learns Arg-I
a Arg-I
non Arg-I
- Arg-I
native Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
country Arg-I
may Arg-I
receive Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
step Arg-I
- Arg-I
by Arg-I
- Arg-I
step Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
method Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
he Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
jumping Arg-I
into Arg-I
the Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
he Arg-B
can Arg-I
set Arg-I
aside Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
energy Arg-I
dedicated Arg-I
to Arg-I
learning Arg-I
the Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
all Arg-B
the Arg-I
learners Arg-I
are Arg-I
probably Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
country Arg-I
, O
so O
all Arg-B
these Arg-I
people Arg-I
most Arg-I
likely Arg-I
have Arg-I
learned Arg-I
the Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
or Arg-I
less Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
when Arg-B
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
learner Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
natives Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
may Arg-I
find Arg-I
native Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
may Arg-I
participate Arg-I
in Arg-I
groups Arg-I
where Arg-I
members Arg-I
are Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
it Arg-B
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
language Arg-I
essential Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
also Arg-I
has Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
up Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
date Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Thus O
he Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
most Arg-I
useful Arg-I
idioms Arg-I
, Arg-I
proverbs Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
many Arg-I
other Arg-I
things Arg-I
which Arg-I
the Arg-I
former Arg-I
person Arg-I
, Arg-I
person Arg-I
' Arg-I
A Arg-I
' Arg-I
, Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
if Arg-B
I Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
and Arg-I
had Arg-I
enough Arg-I
money Arg-I
to Arg-I
afford Arg-I
the Arg-I
travel Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
second Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
evidences Arg-I
show Arg-I
that Arg-I
communication Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
in Arg-I
learning Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
an Arg-I
environment Arg-I
where Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
talks Arg-I
to Arg-I
you Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
expects Arg-I
you Arg-I
express Arg-I
words Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
it Arg-I
as Arg-I
soon Arg-I
and Arg-I
good Arg-I
as Arg-I
possible Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
although O
each O
of O
these O
methods O
have O
their O
pros O
and O
cons O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
that O
advantages Arg-B
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
country Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
spoken Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
the Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Spending O
time O
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
friends O
can O
add O
more O
to O
one O
's O
life O
Despite O
friendship O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
values O
in O
a O
man O
's O
life O
, O
people O
might O
have O
different O
preferences O
: O
some O
of O
them O
prefer O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
one O
or O
two O
close O
friends O
, O
while O
other Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
surrounded Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
I O
prefer O
the O
second O
attitude O
. O

The O
first O
reason O
is O
that O
staying Arg-B
in Arg-I
contact Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
gives Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
more Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
' Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
among Arg-B
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
there Arg-I
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
someone Arg-I
who Arg-I
practices Arg-I
a Arg-I
particular Arg-I
sport Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
plays Arg-I
an Arg-I
instrument Arg-I
or Arg-I
likes Arg-I
traveling Arg-I
very Arg-I
much Arg-I
and Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
attracted Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
something Arg-I
new Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
had Arg-I
never Arg-I
considered Arg-I
before Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
while Arg-B
differences Arg-I
give Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
mean Arg-I
that Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
an Arg-I
agreement Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
happen Arg-I
or Arg-I
at Arg-I
least Arg-I
would Arg-I
happen Arg-I
rarely Arg-I
if Arg-I
one Arg-I
decides Arg-I
to Arg-I
spend Arg-I
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
one Arg-I
or Arg-I
two Arg-I
close Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
that Arg-I
interests Arg-I
and Arg-I
preferences Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
. O

Another O
reason O
is O
that O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
possible Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
you Arg-I
more Arg-I
open Arg-I
- Arg-I
minded Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
happen Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
and Arg-I
ask Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
advice Arg-I
, Arg-I
your Arg-I
friends Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
see Arg-I
that Arg-I
issue Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
different Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
views Arg-I
and Arg-I
accordingly Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
consider Arg-I
better Arg-I
all Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
just Arg-I
few Arg-I
close Arg-I
friends Arg-I
, Arg-I
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
hand Arg-I
you Arg-I
develop Arg-I
a Arg-I
more Arg-I
intimate Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
and Arg-I
you Arg-I
feel Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
trust Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
they Arg-B
often Arg-I
will Arg-I
give Arg-I
you Arg-I
viewpoints Arg-I
not Arg-I
so Arg-I
different Arg-I
from Arg-I
yours Arg-I
, Arg-I
adding Arg-I
less Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
experience Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
although O
each O
choice O
- O
few O
close O
friends O
or O
a O
large O
number O
of O
friends O
- O
presents O
its O
advantages O
and O
its O
weak O
points O
, O
I O
think O
that O
spending Arg-B
time Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
can Arg-I
add Arg-I
more Arg-I
to Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Public O
transportation O
keeps O
society O
from O
the O
depletion O
of O
natural O
resources O

The Arg-B
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
essential Arg-I
thing Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
developed Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

Public Arg-B
transportation Arg-I
keeps Arg-I
society Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
depletion Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
loss Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
sense Arg-I
of Arg-I
community Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
I O
think O
the O
government O
have O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
improving O
it O
. O

The Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
conserve Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
gradually Arg-I
run Arg-I
out Arg-I
. O

Cars Arg-B
depend Arg-I
on Arg-I
oil Arg-I
and Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
to Arg-I
move Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
use Arg-I
too Arg-I
many Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
oil Arg-I
and Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
nonrenewable Arg-I
will Arg-I
run Arg-I
out Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

Instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
using Arg-I
many Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
use Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
bus Arg-I
, Arg-I
train Arg-I
, Arg-I
subway Arg-I
, Arg-I
each Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
oil Arg-I
and Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
up Arg-I
per Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
helps Arg-I
in Arg-I
reducing Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
. O

Cars Arg-B
use Arg-I
oil Arg-I
and Arg-I
gasoline Arg-I
and Arg-I
send Arg-I
out Arg-I
gas Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
carbon Arg-I
dioxide Arg-I
, Arg-I
heat Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
cause Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
warmer Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
more Arg-I
cars Arg-I
are Arg-I
driven Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
put Arg-I
into Arg-I
air Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
use Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
less Arg-I
cars Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
emitted Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
atmosphere Arg-I
, Arg-I
surrounding Arg-I
us Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
protected Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
more Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
make Arg-I
us Arg-I
live Arg-I
more Arg-I
sociable Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
we Arg-I
drive Arg-I
a Arg-I
private Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
alone Arg-I
or Arg-I
only Arg-I
our Arg-I
family Arg-I
members Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
already Arg-I
know Arg-I
and Arg-I
lost Arg-I
the Arg-I
opportunity Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
friends Arg-I
with Arg-I
others Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
that Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
part Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
using Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
more Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
discovery Arg-I
new Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Using Arg-B
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
facing Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
problems Arg-I
: Arg-I

the Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
population Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
isolation Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
depletion Arg-I
of Arg-I
natural Arg-I
resources Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
the O
government O
have O
to O
invest O
more O
for O
it O
and O
encourage O
people O
to O
use O
. O

Some O
students O
prefer O
to O
study O
alone O
Everyone O
has O
their O
method O
to O
success O
in O
life O
. O

At O
school O
or O
university O
, O
success O
depends O
on O
how O
we O
study O
. O

Some O
students O
benefit O
a O
lot O
when O
they O
study O
with O
groups O
. O

Yet O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
individually Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
more Arg-I

it Arg-I
helps Arg-I

my Arg-I
personality Arg-I
. O

Studying Arg-B
alone Arg-I
helps Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
more Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
am Arg-I
a Arg-I
type Arg-I
of Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
my Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
unless Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
can Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
my Arg-I
schedules Arg-I
, Arg-I
guidelines Arg-I
, Arg-I
exercises Arg-I
and Arg-I
go Arg-I
over Arg-I
them Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
we Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
which Arg-I
require Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
sit Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
alone Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
math Arg-I
, Arg-I
reading Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
drawing Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I Arg-B
can Arg-I
take Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
every Arg-I
minute Arg-I
without Arg-I
wasting Arg-I
by Arg-I
studying Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
we Arg-B
are Arg-I
building Arg-I
our Arg-I
personalities Arg-I
when Arg-I
we Arg-I
study Arg-I
alone Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
answering Arg-B
our Arg-I
homework Arg-I
alone Arg-I
encourages Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
and Arg-I
independent Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
it Arg-B
motivates Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
accurate Arg-I
in Arg-I
our Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Personally O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
fix Arg-I
my Arg-I
study Arg-I
plan Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
specific Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
finish Arg-I
it Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
improves Arg-I
my Arg-I
ability Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
more Arg-I
precise Arg-I
and Arg-I
careful Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
to O
study O
and O
it O
is O
our O
right O
to O
choose O
which O
is O
suitable O
for O
our O
characters O
whether O
alone O
or O
with O
group O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I Arg-B
agree Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
idea Arg-I
of Arg-I
studying Arg-I
a Arg-I
lone Arg-I
since O
it Arg-B
helps Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
establish Arg-I
my Arg-I
personality Arg-I
. O

Success O
needs O
us O
to O
work O
hard O
and O
sacrifice O
more O
whether O
we O
choose O
to O
study O
alone O
or O
with O
group O
. O

Some O
important O
characteristics O
of O
a O
co O
- O
worker O

At O
work O
, O
you O
meet O
people O
with O
diverse O
backgrounds O
and O
you O
are O
required O
to O
maintain O
sound O
relationships O
with O
many O
of O
them O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
pleasant O
work O
environment O
. O

However O
, O
the O
relationship O
you O
need O
to O
maintain O
with O
your O
co O
- O
worker O
is O
the O
most O
important O
one O
since O
he O
or O
she O
is O
the O
person O
who O
works O
very O
closely O
with O
you O
, O
and O
in O
most O
instances O
you O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
him O
or O
her O
. O

Therefore O
in O
my O
view O
, O
a Arg-B
good Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
needs Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
three Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
characteristics Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
, Arg-I
trustworthiness Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
fellowship Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
workers Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
cooperative Arg-I
with Arg-I
one Arg-I
another Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
disputes Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
once Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
too Arg-I
family Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
he Arg-B
always Arg-I
left Arg-I
office Arg-I
sharp Arg-I
on Arg-I
time Arg-I
without Arg-I
giving Arg-I
any Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
whether Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
finished Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
his Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
him Arg-I
from Arg-I
getting Arg-I
caught Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
supervisor Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
authoritative Arg-I
person Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
one Arg-B
day Arg-I
I Arg-I
wanted Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
off Arg-I
early Arg-I
because Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
my Arg-I
mother Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
doctor Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
I Arg-I
requested Arg-I
my Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
helping Arg-I
hand Arg-I
to Arg-I
finish Arg-I
my Arg-I
work Arg-I
early Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
turned Arg-I
down Arg-I
my Arg-I
request Arg-I
giving Arg-I
a Arg-I
silly Arg-I
excuse Arg-I
. O

From Arg-B
that Arg-I
day Arg-I
onwards Arg-I
I Arg-I
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
offer Arg-I
him Arg-I
any Arg-I
support Arg-I
and Arg-I
finally Arg-I
he Arg-I
was Arg-I
transferred Arg-I
from Arg-I
our Arg-I
department Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
distant Arg-I
location Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
irresponsibility Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
believe O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
workers Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
corporate Arg-I
with Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
that Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
devastating Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
work Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
workers Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
trust Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
act Arg-I
on Arg-I
suspicion Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
important Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
came Arg-I
across Arg-I
a Arg-I
situation Arg-I
once Arg-I
such Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
subordinates Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
suspect Arg-I
his Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
for Arg-I
carrying Arg-I
tales Arg-I
to Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

To Arg-B
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
extent Arg-I
his Arg-I
suspicion Arg-I
was Arg-I
valid Arg-I
as Arg-I
his Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
made Arg-I
several Arg-I
attempts Arg-I
to Arg-I
highlight Arg-I
the Arg-I
drawbacks Arg-I
of Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

However O
I Arg-B
never Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
tale Arg-I
carriers Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
principle Arg-I
and Arg-I
therefore Arg-I
his Arg-I
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
worker Arg-I
gave Arg-I
up Arg-I
talking Arg-I
ill Arg-I
against Arg-I
him Arg-I
with Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

But Arg-B
this Arg-I
mistrust Arg-I
continued Arg-I
and Arg-I
created Arg-I
very Arg-I
unpleasant Arg-I
situations Arg-I
for Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
department Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
the Arg-B
co Arg-I
- Arg-I
workers Arg-I
should Arg-I
believe Arg-I
in Arg-I
fellowship Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
helps Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
their Arg-I
work Arg-I
life Arg-I
while Arg-I
building Arg-I
up Arg-I
very Arg-I
strong Arg-I
personal Arg-I
relationships Arg-I
. O

After O
all O
, O
you Arg-B
spend Arg-I
most Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
day Arg-I
at Arg-I
office Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
company Arg-I
in Arg-I
office Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
certainly Arg-I
a Arg-I
blessing Arg-I
. O

Distance O
learning O
and O
online O
computer O
classes O
should O
replace O
classroom O
During O
these O
digital O
age O
, O
the O
online O
classes O
has O
become O
more O
interest O
and O
more O
common O
in O
the O
society O
. O

Almost O
every O
school O
develops O
their O
online O
class O
systems O
. O

One O
question O
I O
always O
thought O
about O
is O
whether O
online O
computer O
classes O
should O
replace O
classroom O
learning O
. O

Although O
, O
online Arg-B
classes Arg-I
have Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
, O
for O
me O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
learning Arg-I
classes Arg-I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the Arg-B
participant Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
like Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
or Arg-I
professors Arg-I
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
in Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

Working Arg-B
in Arg-I
group Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
among Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
the Arg-B
discussion Arg-I
class Arg-I
results Arg-I
in Arg-I
expanded Arg-I
children Arg-I
vision Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
respect Arg-I
to Arg-I
others Arg-I
roommate Arg-I
's Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
. O

Unlike Arg-B
the Arg-I
distance Arg-I
learning Arg-I
that Arg-I
children Arg-I
have Arg-I
few Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
to Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
classroom Arg-B
learning Arg-I
provides Arg-I
other Arg-I
activities Arg-I
than Arg-I
studying Arg-I
. O

During Arg-B
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
free Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
activities Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
join Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
playing Arg-I
sports Arg-I
, Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
lab Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
library Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
activities Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
more Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Connection Arg-B
with Arg-I
friends Arg-I
improves Arg-I
their Arg-I
IQ Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
, O
furthermore O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
societies Arg-I
. O

While O
the Arg-B
online Arg-I
course Arg-I
keeps Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
at Arg-I
their Arg-I
home Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

Lastly O
, O
in Arg-B
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
professors Arg-I
that Arg-I
guided Arg-I
you Arg-I
during Arg-I
you Arg-I
had Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
or Arg-I
needed Arg-I
an Arg-I
advice Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
professor Arg-I
provides Arg-I
good Arg-I
answers Arg-I
to Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
mind Arg-I
helping Arg-I
you Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
never Arg-I
leave Arg-I
you Arg-I
alone Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
got Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
in Arg-B
distance Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
these Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
professor Arg-I
had Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
their Arg-I
important Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
professor Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
assigned Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
only Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
response Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
when Arg-I
children Arg-I
ask Arg-I
them Arg-I
a Arg-I
question Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
traditional Arg-B
learning Arg-I
still Arg-I
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

But O
in O
the O
future O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
distance O
learning O
become O
more O
popular O
and O
ordinary O
in O
schools O
. O

Non O
academic O
subjects O
should O
be O
removed O
from O
syllabus O
Students O
have O
become O
more O
and O
more O
stressed O
during O
the O
last O
few O
years O
due O
to O
the O
increase O
in O
academic O
tasks O
assigned O
by O
their O
teachers O
to O
improve O
their O
academic O
success O
. O

While O
some O
people O
believe O
that O
non Arg-B
- Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
completely Arg-I
removed Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
strongly Arg-I
disagree Arg-I
with Arg-I
that Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
from Arg-B
the Arg-I
health Arg-I
point Arg-I
of Arg-I
view Arg-I
, Arg-I
schools Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
deliver Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
physical Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
removed Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
syllabus Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
students Arg-I
’ Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
after Arg-B
studying Arg-I
and Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
classroom Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
morning Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
some Arg-I
outdoor Arg-I
activities Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
stretching Arg-I
, Arg-I
jogging Arg-I
and Arg-I
playing Arg-I
ball Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
ability Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
afternoon Arg-I
classes Arg-I
. O

Removing Arg-B
physical Arg-I
classes Arg-I
from Arg-I
school Arg-I
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
be Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
to Arg-I
young Arg-I
people Arg-I

’s Arg-I
health Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
also Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
their Arg-I
learning Arg-I
capability Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
schools Arg-B
are Arg-I
responsible Arg-I
for Arg-I
developing Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
into Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
rounded Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
than Arg-I
to Arg-I
success Arg-I
only Arg-I
academically Arg-I
. O

Success Arg-B
in Arg-I
life Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
ultimate Arg-I
goal Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
requires Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
academic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
practical Arg-I
life Arg-I
skills Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
cooking Arg-I
, Arg-I
good Arg-I
communication Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
teamwork Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
school Arg-B
education Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
development Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
as O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
more Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
independent Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
students Arg-B
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
practical Arg-I
skills Arg-I
after Arg-I
school Arg-I
hours Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
idea Arg-I
because O
most Arg-B
young Arg-I
people Arg-I
would Arg-I
rather Arg-I
watch Arg-I
TV Arg-I
or Arg-I
play Arg-I
computer Arg-I
games Arg-I
after Arg-I
school Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
life Arg-I
skills Arg-I
from Arg-I
their Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
parents Arg-B
are Arg-I
usually Arg-I
too Arg-I
busy Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
daily Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
to Arg-I
teach Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
non Arg-B
- Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
are Arg-I
as Arg-I
essential Arg-I
as Arg-I
academic Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
’s Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
schools Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
remove Arg-I
these Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

Follow O
the O
New O
Customs O
of O
the O
New O
Country O
or O
Not O
? O

When O
people O
move O
to O
another O
country O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
they O
will O
face O
the O
choice O
between O
following O
the O
customs O
of O
the O
new O
country O
or O
keeping O
their O
original O
one O
. O

Some O
people O
choose O
the O
former O
one O
to O
assimilate O
themselves O
into O
the O
new O
culture O
, O
while O
some O
insist O
the O
latter O
one O
because O
the O
new O
customs O
are O
difficult O
to O
be O
accepted O
. O

As O
for O
me O
, O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
customs Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
migrated Arg-I
to Arg-I
another Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
easier Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
assimilate Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
customs Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
migrate Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
shock Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
difference Arg-I
between Arg-I
two Arg-I
cultures Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
custom Arg-I
is Arg-I
just Arg-I
a Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
following Arg-I
the Arg-I
custom Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
this Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
one Arg-I
wore Arg-I
in Arg-I
white Arg-I
and Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
common Arg-I
Viharas Arg-I
to Arg-I
observe Arg-I
a Arg-I
rather Arg-I
longer Arg-I

, Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
would Arg-I
learn Arg-I
something Arg-I
about Arg-I
Indian Arg-I
religion Arg-I
and Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
people Arg-B
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
they Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
keeping Arg-B
own Arg-I
customs Arg-I
stably Arg-I
might Arg-I
cause Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
people Arg-I
insist Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
customs Arg-I
and Arg-I
refuse Arg-I
to Arg-I
accept Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
one Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
regard Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
special Arg-I
group Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
may Arg-I
also Arg-I
regard Arg-I
them Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
special Arg-I
group Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
and Arg-I
separate Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
- Arg-I
stream Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
example Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
is Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
in Arg-I
Indonesia Arg-I
in Arg-I
1969 Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
formed Arg-I
Chinatown Arg-I
and Arg-I
kept Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
language Arg-I
and Arg-I
customs Arg-I
in Arg-I
it Arg-I
. O

While Arg-B
the Arg-I
Indonesians Arg-I
stopped Arg-I
working Arg-I
at Arg-I
4:00 Arg-I
pm Arg-I
and Arg-I
went Arg-I
home Arg-I
for Arg-I
rest Arg-I
, Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
were Arg-I
still Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

Although O
being Arg-B
much Arg-I
richer Arg-I
than Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
faced Arg-I
the Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
. O

Their Arg-B
houses Arg-I
and Arg-I
private Arg-I
cars Arg-I
were Arg-I
buried Arg-I
by Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
, O
because O
the Arg-B
locals Arg-I
were Arg-I
jealous Arg-I
of Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
had Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
wealth Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
theirs Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
immigrants Arg-I
had Arg-I
followed Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
customs Arg-I
and Arg-I
assimilated Arg-I
into Arg-I
Indonesia Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
regards Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
of Arg-I
Chinese Arg-I
and Arg-I
discrimination Arg-I
might Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
alleviated Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
immigrants Arg-I
should Arg-I
follow Arg-I
the Arg-I
customs Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
new Arg-I
country Arg-I
, O
which O
can O
help O
them O
survive O
from O
the O
culture O
shock O
sooner O
, O
and O
assimilate O
to O
a O
new O
culture O
. O

School O
memories O
Everyone O
has O
happy O
moments O
during O
their O
life O
. O

These O
happy O
moments O
are O
both O
in O
their O
childhood O
and O
their O
adulthood O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
in Arg-B
childhood Arg-I
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
happier Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
adulthood Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
bills Arg-I
, Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
would Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
be Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
just Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
two Arg-I
things Arg-I
: Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
fun Arg-I
, Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
. O

A Arg-B
child Arg-I
's Arg-I
daily Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
playing Arg-I
and Arg-I
sleeping Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
young Arg-I

I Arg-I
just Arg-I
came Arg-I
home Arg-I
from Arg-I
school Arg-I

and Arg-I
then Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
took Arg-I
my Arg-I
bike Arg-I
or Arg-I
soccer Arg-I
ball Arg-I
and Arg-I
go Arg-I
out Arg-I
and Arg-I
play Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
in Arg-I
my Arg-I
neighborhood Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
I Arg-B
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
costs Arg-I
and Arg-I
other Arg-I
things Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
just Arg-I
had Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
learned Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
most Arg-I
creative Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
were Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
children Arg-B
imagine Arg-I
new Arg-I
things Arg-I
and Arg-I
games Arg-I
just Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
period Arg-I
where Arg-I
people Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
school Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
school Arg-B
memories Arg-I
are Arg-I
one Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
memories Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
you Arg-I
learn Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
your Arg-I
first Arg-I
love Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
new Arg-I
long Arg-I
- Arg-I
lasting Arg-I
friendships Arg-I
and Arg-I
of Arg-I
- Arg-I
course Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
fun Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
father Arg-I
's Arg-I
best Arg-I
moments Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
life Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
school Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
he Arg-B
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
in Arg-I
- Arg-I
touch Arg-I
with Arg-I
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
his Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
and Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
together Arg-I
and Arg-I
share Arg-I
their Arg-I
childhood Arg-I
memories Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
childhood Arg-B
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
happiest Arg-I
moments Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
life O
and O
one O
childhood O
and O
people O
should O
live O
their O
childhood O
thoroughly O
. O

Learning O
to O
be O
independent O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
adults O
Learning O
to O
be O
independent O
is O
essential O
for O
young O
adults O
. O

However O
, O
how O
early O
the O
children O
leave O
their O
parents O
is O
a O
difficult O
issue O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
staying Arg-B
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
longer Arg-I
time Arg-I
does Arg-I
more Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
than Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
. O

My O
opinion O
is O
based O
on O
creating O
memories O
with O
parents O
, O
saving O
money O
, O
and O
taking O
advice O
from O
parents O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
upsides O
is O
that O
the Arg-B
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
experience Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
has Arg-I
to Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
create Arg-I
memories Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
dad Arg-I
and Arg-I
mom Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
of Arg-I
low Arg-I
possibilities Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
hometown Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
he Arg-I
lives Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
parents Arg-I
for Arg-I
longer Arg-I
time Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
to Arg-I
share Arg-I
the Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
, Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
travel Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
memories Arg-I
become Arg-I
priceless Arg-I
treasure Arg-I
as Arg-I
time Arg-I
passes Arg-I
by Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
think O
undergoing Arg-B
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
is Arg-I
worthwhile Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
living Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
costs Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
living Arg-I
outside Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
independent Arg-I
means Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
needs Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
he Arg-B
may Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
rent Arg-I
a Arg-I
house Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
rental Arg-I
would Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
burden Arg-I
for Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
another Arg-B
daily Arg-I
expense Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
the Arg-I
considerable Arg-I
outgoings Arg-I
. O

Spending Arg-B
much Arg-I
money Arg-I
may Arg-I
not Arg-I
result Arg-I
in Arg-I
what Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
expect Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
the Arg-B
parents Arg-I
can Arg-I
save Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
their Arg-I
children Arg-I
live Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
longer Arg-I
. O

The O
third O
convincing O
reason O
is O
that O
the Arg-B
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
needs Arg-I
father Arg-I
and Arg-I
mother Arg-I
's Arg-I
suggestions Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
in Arg-I
dilemma Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
can Arg-I
comfort Arg-I
him Arg-I
and Arg-I
give Arg-I
him Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
hand Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
most Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
him Arg-I
can Arg-I
give Arg-I
a Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
advice Arg-I
and Arg-I
lead Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
parents Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
help Arg-I
him Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
suffer Arg-I
more Arg-I
pain Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
taking Arg-B
advice Arg-I
from Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
young Arg-I
adult Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
through Arg-I
obstacles Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
living Arg-B
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
longer Arg-I
brings Arg-I
about Arg-I
memories Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
less Arg-I
cost Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
advice Arg-I
from Arg-I
parents Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
staying Arg-B
longer Arg-I
with Arg-I
parents Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
or O
disagree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
a O
zoo O
has O
no O
useful O
purpose O

Some O
people O
may O
believe O
that O
a O
zoo O
is O
futile O
in O
the O
era O
of O
globalization O
, O
which O
people O
can O
develop O
their O
knowledge O
fast O
and O
easily O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
them O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
is Arg-I
invaluable Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
beings Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
helps Arg-I
animals Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
extinction Arg-I
. O

Also O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
travel Arg-I
location Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
gives Arg-I
humans Arg-I
new Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

When O
you O
were O
so O
young O
that O
you O
did O
not O
know O
many O
kinds O
of O
animals O
, O
what O
should O
you O
do O
if O
there O
were O
no O
zoo O
? O

Inevitably O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
important Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
innate Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
also Arg-I
let Arg-I
students Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
learning Arg-I
biology Arg-I
practically Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
observe Arg-I
animals Arg-I
' Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
and Arg-I
features Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
practical Arg-B
learning Arg-I
help Arg-I
students Arg-I
relax Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
boring Arg-I
lecture Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
researchers Arg-B
need Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
to Arg-I
pick Arg-I
up Arg-I
some Arg-I
examples Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
researches Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
has Arg-I
diverse Arg-I
species Arg-I
of Arg-I
animals Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
preserves Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
rare Arg-I
animals Arg-I
and Arg-I
provides Arg-I
them Arg-I
safe Arg-I
habitats Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
so Arg-I
harmful Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
forest Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
, Arg-I
fed Arg-I
by Arg-I
zookeepers Arg-I
, Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
food Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we Arg-B
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
artificial Arg-I
insemenation Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
nearly Arg-I
extinct Arg-I
wildlife Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
because Arg-B
of Arg-I
all Arg-I
weird Arg-I
, Arg-I
acute Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
tourist Arg-I
attraction Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
who Arg-I
seek Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
those Arg-I
animals Arg-I
closely Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
zoo Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
both Arg-I
national Arg-I
and Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
receive Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

That Arg-B
also Arg-I
make Arg-I
money Arg-I
flow Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
economics Arg-I
become Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
country Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
saves Arg-I
animals Arg-I
in Arg-I
danger Arg-I
of Arg-I
extinction Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
helps Arg-I
people Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
zoo Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
earth Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
, O
spending O
budget O
on O
space O
exploration O
is O
not O
reasonable O
Space O
exploration O
, O
for O
discovery O
of O
out O
of O
space O
, O
has O
been O
possible O
for O
human O
in O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

The O
United O
state O
and O
Russia O
are O
the O
important O
countries O
that O
spend O
large O
budgets O
for O
the O
research O
of O
this O
subject O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
spending Arg-B
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
for Arg-I
space Arg-I
exploration Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
activity Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
living Arg-I
of Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
governments Arg-I
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
space Arg-I
exploration Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
activity Arg-I
that Arg-I
wastes Arg-I
the Arg-I
budget Arg-I
, O
while O
the Arg-B
essential Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
of Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
discovery Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
living Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
20th Arg-I
century Arg-I
, Arg-I
although Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
succeeded Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
space Arg-I
by Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
new Arg-I
technologies Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
rockets Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
finding Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
another Arg-I
planet Arg-I
is Arg-I
impossible Arg-I
until Arg-I
now Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
during Arg-I
history Arg-I
, Arg-I
our Arg-I
planet Arg-I
is Arg-I
threatening Arg-I
by Arg-I
many Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
planets Arg-I
or Arg-I
stars Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
danger Arg-I
for Arg-I
living Arg-I
of Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
very Arg-I
significant Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
place Arg-I
for Arg-I
living Arg-I
in Arg-I
other Arg-I
planets Arg-I
. O

Space Arg-B
exploration Arg-I
has Arg-I
used Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
tools Arg-I
for Arg-I
military Arg-I
power Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
cold Arg-I
war Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
, Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
attach Arg-I
of Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
by Arg-I
using Arg-I
and Arg-I
invention Arg-I
new Arg-I
missiles Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
space Arg-I
race Arg-I
happened Arg-I
between Arg-I
the Arg-I
United Arg-I
Stated Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
Soviet Arg-I
Union Arg-I
. O

Both Arg-B
countries Arg-I
tried Arg-I
to Arg-I
send Arg-I
man Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
moon Arg-I
and Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
power Arg-I
to Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
space Arg-B
exploration Arg-I
will Arg-I
use Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
military Arg-I
power Arg-I
for Arg-I
many Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

In O
summary O
, O
spending Arg-B
budget Arg-I
for Arg-I
space Arg-I
exploring Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
waste Arg-I
budget Arg-I
, O
because O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
of Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
. O

Although O
exploring O
space O
used O
for O
discovery O
of O
other O
planets O
, O
nowadays O
most O
of O
governments O
have O
used O
many O
rockets O
for O
military O
purposes O
and O
therefore O
the O
purposes O
of O
exploring O
space O
has O
altered O
. O

Friendship O
is O
more O
important O
than O
mistake O
by O
a O
friend O
, O
although O
mistake O
is O
terrible O

There O
is O
an O
argument O
regrading O
weather O
letting O
a O
friend O
make O
a O
mistake O
is O
better O
than O
taking O
action O
that O
risks O
destroying O
a O
friendship O
. O

It O
is O
widely O
accepted O
by O
many O
people O
that O
a O
mistake O
will O
return O
sometimes O
terrible O
result O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
friendship Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
important Arg-I
than Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
, O
although O
mistake Arg-B
is Arg-I
terrible Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
essay O
, O
I O
will O
present O
two O
reasons O
supporting O
my O
opinion O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a Arg-B
mistake Arg-I
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
last Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
but Arg-I
a Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
lasts Arg-I
forever Arg-I
. O

Anybody Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
remember Arg-I
mistakes Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
someone Arg-I
remembers Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
closed Arg-I
mind Arg-I
. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
mistakes Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
forgotten Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
my Arg-B
friend Arg-I
Lee Arg-I
made Arg-I
a Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
broke Arg-I
my Arg-I
precious Arg-I
gift Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
forgot Arg-I
about Arg-I
it Arg-I
just Arg-I
after Arg-I
two Arg-I
days Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
felt Arg-I
at Arg-I
peace Arg-I
with Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
might O
say O
I O
am O
silly O
, O
but O
I O
think O
mistake Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
forgettable Arg-I
than Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
Everybody Arg-B
makes Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
end Arg-I
a Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
whenever Arg-I
your Arg-I
friend Arg-I
makes Arg-I
a Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
friends Arg-I
around Arg-I
you Arg-I
. O

I O
agree O
if Arg-B
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
makes Arg-I
very Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
end Arg-I
a Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
when Arg-B
the Arg-I
mistake Arg-I
friend Arg-I
made Arg-I
was Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
friend Arg-I
and Arg-I
forgive Arg-I
it Arg-I
because O
a Arg-B
friend Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
gift Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

According Arg-B
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
research Arg-I
, Arg-I
85 Arg-I
% Arg-I
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
answered Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
best Arg-I
gift Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
. O

I O
think O
that O
a Arg-B
mistake Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
brake Arg-I
friendship Arg-I
if Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
a Arg-I
big Arg-I
because O
friendship Arg-B
is Arg-I
forever Arg-I
and Arg-I
gift Arg-I
our Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Students O
should O
be O
required O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
tests O

The O
issue O
at O
hand O
is O
if O
the O
schools O
should O
require O
students O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
exams O
. O

This O
issue O
is O
important O
because O
nowadays O
many O
people O
cast O
doubt O
on O
it O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
standardized Arg-B
tests Arg-I
are Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
option Arg-I
for Arg-I
educational Arg-I
system Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
help Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
if Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
really Arg-I
getting Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
standardized Arg-B
tests Arg-I
are Arg-I
preferable Arg-I
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they Arg-B
help Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
fairly Arg-I
grade Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
some Arg-B
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
so Arg-I
active Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
, Arg-I
cause Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
already Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
issue Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
exams Arg-B
could Arg-I
be Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
to Arg-I
see Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
of Arg-I
those Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
many Arg-B
teachers Arg-I
rely Arg-I
only Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
exam Arg-I
results Arg-I
while Arg-I
grading Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
, O
so O
the Arg-B
usage Arg-I
of Arg-I
standardized Arg-I
tests Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
superior Arg-I
option Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
standardized Arg-B
tests Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
good Arg-I
chance Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
apply Arg-I
their Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
practice Arg-I
. O

Since O
, O
some Arg-B
students Arg-I
may Arg-I
get Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
simply Arg-I
rewriting Arg-I
solved Arg-I
problems Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
blackboard Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
problems Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
standardized Arg-B
tests Arg-I
offer Arg-I
them Arg-I
such Arg-I
chance Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
schools Arg-B
should Arg-I
require Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
standardized Arg-I
tests Arg-I
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
this Arg-I
option Arg-I
helps Arg-I
to Arg-I
both Arg-I
sides Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
requirement Arg-B
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
standardized Arg-I
tests Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
choice Arg-I
, O
since O
in Arg-B
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
can Arg-I
compare Arg-I
the Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
any Arg-I
class Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
students Arg-I
who Arg-I
will Arg-I
show Arg-I
low Arg-I
academic Arg-I
performance Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
could Arg-I
work Arg-I
with Arg-I
them Arg-I
more Arg-I
intensively Arg-I
. O

I O
support O
the O
points O
of O
those O
who O
say O
that O
standardized Arg-B
tests Arg-I
are Arg-I
required Arg-I
over Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
do Arg-I
n’t Arg-I
because O
if Arg-B
the Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
would Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
level Arg-I
of Arg-I
each Arg-I
student Arg-I
he Arg-I
would Arg-I
fairly Arg-I
share Arg-I
his Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
all Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Ultimately O
I O
feel O
that O
schools Arg-B
which Arg-I
obligate Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
standardized Arg-I
tests Arg-I
are Arg-I
right Arg-I
. O

I O
belive O
this O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
these Arg-B
schools Arg-I
can Arg-I
qualitatively Arg-I
check Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
giving Arg-I
an Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
education Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Most O
difficult O
experiences O
will O
become O
valuable O
lessons O

There O
is O
a O
famous O
old O
saying O
that O
failure O
is O
the O
mother O
of O
success O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
, O
some O
people O
advocate O
that O
some O
difficulties O
people O
met O
at O
their O
early O
ages O
will O
become O
an O
invaluable O
fortune O
in O
their O
future O
lives O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
is O
n't O
supposed O
to O
be O
that O
case O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
I O
am O
in O
favor O
the O
former O
statement O
that O
some Arg-B
tough Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
people Arg-I
met Arg-I
before Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
helpful Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
path Arg-I
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
hardship Arg-B
makes Arg-I
people Arg-I
realize Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
cherish Arg-I
and Arg-I
compliment Arg-I
the Arg-I
common Arg-I
but Arg-I
wonderful Arg-I
little Arg-I
things Arg-I
happened Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
shining Arg-I
weather Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
delicious Arg-I
breakfast Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
such Arg-I
nice Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
usually Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
find Arg-I
the Arg-I
true Arg-I
love Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
seduced Arg-I
by Arg-I
greed Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
lose Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
end Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
experiences Arg-B
of Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
teach Arg-I
them Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
keep Arg-I
a Arg-I
nice Arg-I
mood Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
all Arg-I
the Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
lots Arg-I
of Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
calmer Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
troubles Arg-I
. O

Because O
they Arg-B
already Arg-I
have Arg-I
such Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
of Arg-I
overcoming Arg-I
some Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
of Arg-I
what Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
when Arg-I
fierce Arg-I
crisis Arg-I
happens Arg-I
. O

Those Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
their Arg-I
ambitions Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
aware Arg-I
of Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
lead Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
reach Arg-I
success Arg-I
despite Arg-I
what Arg-I
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
are Arg-I
getting Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
to O
sum O
it O
up O
, O
both O
not O
afraid O
of O
difficulties O
and O
appreciating O
common O
but O
pleasant O
things O
in O
their O
lives O

drive O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
most Arg-B
tough Arg-I
experiences Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
path Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
priceless Arg-I
treasure Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Remember O
if O
you O
are O
afraid O
of O
encountering O
difficulties O
, O
then O
you O
will O
be O
in O
the O
troubles O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Life O
in O
a O
city O
is O
much O
better O
than O
life O
in O
the O
countryside O
As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
life Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
life Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
education Arg-I
system Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
, O
that O
the Arg-B
schools Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
universities Arg-I
have Arg-I
well Arg-I
equipped Arg-I
classes Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
famous Arg-I
professors Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
such Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
city Arg-B
provides Arg-I
more Arg-I
work Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
than Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
more Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
paid Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
expensive Arg-I
, O
but O
incomes Arg-B
are Arg-I
higher Arg-I
too O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
urban Arg-I
areas Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
more Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
what Arg-I
means Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
is Arg-I
huge Arg-I
. O

Meeting Arg-B
and Arg-I
knowing Arg-I
new Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
unforgettable Arg-I
experience Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
could Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
previous Arg-I
habits Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
city Arg-I
has Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
organised Arg-I
lines Arg-I
of Arg-I
transport Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
buses Arg-I
and Arg-I
trains Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
frequent Arg-I
than Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
, O
so O
the Arg-B
city Arg-I
provides Arg-I
better Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
places Arg-I
to Arg-I
rest Arg-I
, Arg-I
because Arg-I
of Arg-I
its Arg-I
location Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
peaceful Arg-B
and Arg-I
close Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
nature Arg-I
areas Arg-I
could Arg-I
help Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
worries Arg-I
and Arg-I
sadness Arg-I
. O

Taking O
all O
into O
account O
, O
I O
think O
that O
living Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
better Arg-I
nowadays Arg-I
, O
because O
of O
the O
opportunities O
it O
gives O
. O

Today O
living O
in O
the O
rural O
places O
is O
in O
most O
causes O
connected O
with O
agrarian O
lifestyle O
, O
which O
for O
me O
is O
without O
perspective O
. O

If O
I O
could O
decide O
I O
would O
chose O
living O
in O
the O
city O
for O
sure O
. O

becoming O
more O
perfect O
every O
day O
. O

Communication O
nowadays O
depends O
on O
technology O
pretty O
much O
. O

Voice O
mail O
, O
e O
- O
mail O
, O
telephone O
or O
just O
traditional O
way O
: O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
prefer Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
3 Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
: Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
, Arg-I
honest Arg-I
expression Arg-I
and Arg-I
fluency Arg-I
in Arg-I
communicating Arg-I
. O

Everyone O
agrees O
that O
e Arg-B
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
way Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
can Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
others Arg-I
from Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
mile Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
Vietnam Arg-I
and Arg-I
another Arg-I
person Arg-I
is Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
US Arg-I
- Arg-I
half Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
, Arg-I
no Arg-I
matter Arg-I
how Arg-I
far Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
keep Arg-I
contact Arg-I
. O

We Arg-B
will Arg-I
never Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
worry Arg-I
if Arg-I
our Arg-I
mails Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
sent Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
address Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
address Arg-I
is Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
, Arg-I
then Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
know Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
e Arg-B
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
take Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
time Arg-I
: Arg-I
just Arg-I
a Arg-I
click Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
writing Arg-B
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
helps Arg-I
people Arg-I
express Arg-I
honestly Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
the Arg-B
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
conversations Arg-I
make Arg-I
them Arg-I
feel Arg-I
stupid Arg-I
. O

Sometimes Arg-B
, Arg-I
their Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
expressed Arg-I
as Arg-I
exactly Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
expect Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
I Arg-B
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
about Arg-I
a Arg-I
ticklish Arg-I
problem Arg-I
like Arg-I
her Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
hard Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
face Arg-I
her Arg-I
and Arg-I
explain Arg-I
what Arg-I
she Arg-I
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
e Arg-B
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
tool Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
me Arg-I
speak Arg-I
out Arg-I
. O

She Arg-B
will Arg-I
just Arg-I
read Arg-I
my Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
instead Arg-I
of Arg-I
listening Arg-I
to Arg-I
my Arg-I
voice Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
her Arg-I
annoyed Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
thing Arg-I

can Arg-I
make Arg-I
my Arg-I
opinion Arg-I
become Arg-I
unpersuasive Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
every Arg-B
communication Arg-I
needs Arg-I
fluency Arg-I

so O
people Arg-B
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
exactly Arg-I
and Arg-I
remember Arg-I
it Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
long Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Voice Arg-B
email Arg-I
or Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
conversations Arg-I
sometimes Arg-I
make Arg-I
reserve Arg-I
people Arg-I
feel Arg-I
not Arg-I
very Arg-I
confident Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
I Arg-I
face Arg-I
my Arg-I
parents Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
speak Arg-I
out Arg-I
every Arg-I
idea Arg-I
and Arg-I
express Arg-I
consecutively Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
may Arg-I
stop Arg-I
me Arg-I
, Arg-I
speak Arg-I
something Arg-I
against Arg-I
it Arg-I
and Arg-I
that Arg-I
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
forget Arg-I
what Arg-I
I Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
say Arg-I
. O

Anyone Arg-B
can Arg-I
meet Arg-I
this Arg-I
problem Arg-I
once Arg-I
in Arg-I
any Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
. O

E Arg-B
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
helps Arg-I
me Arg-I
arrange Arg-I
my Arg-I
idea Arg-I
perfectly Arg-I
and Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
persuasive Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
to O
compare O
to O
all O
ways O
of O
communication O
, O
I O
really O
think O
that O
e Arg-B
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
greatest Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
major Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
. O

Its Arg-B
convenience Arg-I
saves Arg-I
our Arg-I
time Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
honesty O
is O
necessary O
for O
every O
conversation O
and O
also O
fluency O
ca O
n't O
be O
missing O
for O
a O
persuasive O
expression O
. O

Communicating O
via O
e O
- O
mail O
and O
voice O
mail O
vs O
Telephone O
and O
face O
- O
to O
face O

Although O
many O
people O
prefer O
communicating O
by O
telephone O
or O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
, O
personally O
I O
believe O
that O
communicating Arg-B
by Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mails Arg-I
or Arg-I
voice Arg-I
mails Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
to O
support O
this O
idea O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
in O
this O
essay O
. O

Firstly O
, O
communicating Arg-B
by Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
people Arg-I
have Arg-I
problems Arg-I
with Arg-I
calling Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
acquainted Arg-I
with Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
this Arg-I
case Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
so Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
write Arg-I
an Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
a Arg-I
voice Arg-I
mail Arg-I
because O
even Arg-B
shy Arg-I
people Arg-I
feel Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
more Arg-I
confident Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
write Arg-I
an Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
at Arg-I
any Arg-I
time Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

As O
for O
me O
, O
I Arg-B
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
study Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
university Arg-I

and Arg-I
I Arg-I
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
spare Arg-I
time Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
day Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
get Arg-I
home Arg-I
at Arg-I
about Arg-I
midnight Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
still Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
answer Arg-I
some Arg-I
questions Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
some Arg-I
routine Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
call Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
or Arg-I
to Arg-I
meet Arg-I
with Arg-I
him Arg-I
or Arg-I
her Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
time Arg-I
so O
for Arg-B
me Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
leave Arg-I
a Arg-I
voice Arg-I
mail Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
when Arg-B
you Arg-I
write Arg-I
an Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
you Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
carefully Arg-I
about Arg-I
what Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
writing Arg-I
and Arg-I
how Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
to Arg-I
express Arg-I
yourself Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
you Arg-B
can Arg-I
change Arg-I
the Arg-I
word Arg-I
order Arg-I
or Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
choose Arg-I
more Arg-I
appropriate Arg-I
style Arg-I
to Arg-I
sound Arg-I
more Arg-I
polite Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
you Arg-I
speak Arg-I
face Arg-I
- Arg-I
to Arg-I
- Arg-I
face Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
as Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
every Arg-I
word Arg-I
as Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
write Arg-I
an Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
. O

And O
finally O
, O
there Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
disturb Arg-I
people Arg-I
by Arg-I
sending Arg-I
them Arg-I
an Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
mail Arg-I
. O

You Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
worry Arg-I
about Arg-I
interrupting Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
conversation Arg-I
or Arg-I
some Arg-I
other Arg-I
business Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
for O
me O
both O
options O
of O
communicating O
are O
possible O
, O
but O
if O
this O
is O
an O
important O
and O
not O
urgent O
question O
I Arg-B
would Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
to Arg-I
answer Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
means Arg-I
of Arg-I
internet Arg-I
or Arg-I
voice Arg-I
mail Arg-I
. O

Should O
we O
require O
our O
young O
children O
to O
learn O
music O
and O
art O

Every O
parents O
expect O
their O
children O
to O
be O
outstanding O
and O
successful O
. O

In O
order O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
they O
start O
cultivating O
their O
children O
when O
they O
are O
very O
young O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
basic O
knowledge O
like O
language O
or O
science O
, O
music O
and O
art O
are O
usually O
on O
the O
must O
- O
learn O
list O
of O
the O
parents O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
children Arg-B
should Arg-I
learn Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
young Arg-I
age Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
do Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
several Arg-I
merits Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

First O
, O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
very Arg-I
suitable Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
senses Arg-I
of Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
young Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
absorb Arg-I
things Arg-I
quickly Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
bear Arg-I
exact Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
needed Arg-I
in Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
- Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
. O

Music Arg-B
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
like Arg-I
math Arg-I
or Arg-I
language Arg-I
which Arg-I
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
strict Arg-I
rules Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
abstract Arg-I
, Arg-I
requiring Arg-I
creativity Arg-I
and Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
enriched Arg-I
. O

Children Arg-B
are Arg-I
privileged Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
these Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
more Arg-I
freedom Arg-I
and Arg-I
their Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
has Arg-I
not Arg-I
yet Arg-I
been Arg-I
killed Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
reality Arg-I
circumstances Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
if Arg-I
their Arg-I
performances Arg-I
are Arg-I
just Arg-I
some Arg-I
simple Arg-I
drawings Arg-I
and Arg-I
melodies Arg-I
, Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
still Arg-I
bring Arg-I
out Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
joy Arg-I
of Arg-I
flying Arg-I
in Arg-I
imagination Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
music Arg-B
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
are Arg-I
life Arg-I
- Arg-I
long Arg-I
cultivation Arg-I
worthy Arg-I
of Arg-I
investing Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
teach Arg-I
us Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
appreciate Arg-I
beauty Arg-I
and Arg-I
express Arg-I
feelings Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
creative Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
are Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
spiritual Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
even Arg-B
if Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
great Arg-I
musicians Arg-I
or Arg-I
artists Arg-I
, Arg-I
learning Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
is Arg-I
still Arg-I
worthy Arg-I
because O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
nourish Arg-I
your Arg-I
temper Arg-I
and Arg-I
serve Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
leisure Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
parents Arg-B
should Arg-I
n't Arg-I
put Arg-I
so Arg-I
much Arg-I
stress Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
, O
since O
learning Arg-B
too Arg-I
many Arg-I
skills Arg-I
seems Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
burden Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it Arg-B
depends Arg-I
on Arg-I
how Arg-I
you Arg-I
value Arg-I
these Arg-I
learning Arg-I
activities Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
like Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
parents Arg-I
push Arg-I
their Arg-I
5 Arg-I
years Arg-I
old Arg-I
child Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
piano Arg-I
8 Arg-I
hours Arg-I
a Arg-I
day Arg-I
just Arg-I
like Arg-I
a Arg-I
professional Arg-I
performer Arg-I
, Arg-I
that Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
a Arg-I
child Arg-I
stage Arg-I
, Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
like Arg-I
an Arg-I
open Arg-I
door Arg-I
to Arg-I
introduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
art Arg-I
world Arg-I
than Arg-I
training Arg-I
area Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
specific Arg-I
skills Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
it Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
such Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
young Arg-B
age Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
perfect Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
music Arg-I
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
and O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
indeed Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
young Arg-I
stage Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
stage Arg-I
. O

Music Arg-B
and Arg-I
art Arg-I
can Arg-I
accompany Arg-I
a Arg-I
spirit Arg-I
as Arg-I
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
enter Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

The O
car O
use O
will O
definitely O
decrease O
in O
twenty O
years O
Views O
differ O
considerably O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
cars O
will O
be O
less O
than O
there O
are O
today O
in O
twenty O
years O
or O
not O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
since O
the O
environmental O
concern O
has O
risen O
, O
the O
car O
use O
will O
decrease O
. O

While O
others O
think O
that O
a O
personal O
car O
is O
important O
for O
ones O
daily O
life O
. O

Both O
of O
the O
opposite O
arguments O
appear O
to O
be O
somewhat O
convincing O
and O
stand O
to O
reason O
. O

But O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
, O
which O
is O
that O
there Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
in Arg-I
cars Arg-I
use Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

The O
following O
reasons O
will O
present O
my O
points O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
since O
the Arg-B
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
has Arg-I
improved Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
much Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
subway Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
which Arg-I
always Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
jam Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
morning Arg-I
and Arg-I
does Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
enough Arg-I
parking Arg-I
lots Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
cars Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
stations Arg-I
increased Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
a Arg-I
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
than Arg-I
drive Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
a Arg-B
driving Arg-I
car Arg-I
can Arg-I
make Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
different Arg-I
pollutions Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
with Arg-B
the Arg-I
risen Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
aware Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
think Arg-I
more Arg-I
about Arg-I
whether Arg-I
to Arg-I
drive Arg-I
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
or Arg-I
not Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
instead Arg-B
of Arg-I
driving Arg-I
each Arg-I
one Arg-I
's Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
put Arg-I
forty Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
bus Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
traffic Arg-I
jam Arg-I
by Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
the Arg-I
cars Arg-I
use Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
air Arg-I
pollution Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

Although O
, O
I O
am O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
reducing O
of O
the O
car O
use O
will O
be O
achieve O
in O
twenty O
years O
. O

I O
think O
I O
still O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
there O
are O
some O
different O
points O
of O
view O
. O

People O
who O
hold O
different O
opinion O
may O
argue O
that O
a Arg-B
personal Arg-I
car Arg-I
uses Arg-I
is Arg-I
in Arg-I
need Arg-I
because O
a Arg-B
public Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
ca Arg-I
n't Arg-I
meet Arg-I
every Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it Arg-B
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
true Arg-I
when Arg-I
you Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
some Arg-I
countryside Arg-I
or Arg-I
some Arg-I
other Arg-I
inconvenience Arg-I
places Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
no Arg-B
matter Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
somewhere Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
trip Arg-I

or Arg-I
you Arg-I
just Arg-I
simply Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
suburbs Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
always Arg-I
have Arg-I
some Arg-I
other Arg-I
ways Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
do Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
ride Arg-I
a Arg-I
bike Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
even Arg-I
walk Arg-I
on Arg-I
your Arg-I
feet Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
helps Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
car Arg-I
use Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
good Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
this Arg-B
wo Arg-I
n't Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
problem Arg-I
at Arg-I
all Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
given O
the O
reasons O
described O
above O
, O
when O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
of O
whether O
there O
will O
be O
fewer O
cars O
in O
use O
in O
twenty O
years O
or O
not O
are O
carefully O
compared O
, O
the O
best O
choice O
is O
obviously O
stand O
on O
my O
side O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the Arg-B
car Arg-I
use Arg-I
will Arg-I
definitely Arg-I
decrease Arg-I
in Arg-I
twenty Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Working O
at O
home O
vs O
Working O
in O
a O
company O
Due O
to O
the O
convenience O
of O
current O
technology O
, O
people O
can O
do O
their O
works O
everywhere O
as O
long O
as O
they O
have O
the O
equipment O
around O
them O
. O

People O
are O
no O
longer O
restricted O
in O
the O
office O
. O

This O
rapid O
progress O
in O
technology O
leads O
to O
the O
question O
whether O
it O
's O
better O
working O
at O
home O
with O
a O
computer O
and O
a O
phone O
than O
working O
at O
the O
company O
's O
office O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
working Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
is Arg-I
worse Arg-I
and Arg-I
less Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
than Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
office Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
while Arg-B
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
office Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
interact Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
instantly Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
either Arg-I
get Arg-I
help Arg-I
from Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
or Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

Think Arg-B
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
big Arg-I
project Arg-I
that Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
is Arg-I
working Arg-I
on Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
any Arg-I
group Arg-I
member Arg-I
has Arg-I
new Arg-I
idea Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
project Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
/ Arg-I
she Arg-I
can Arg-I
assemble Arg-I
his Arg-I
/ Arg-I
her Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
and Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
more Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
and Arg-I
straight Arg-I
- Arg-I
forward Arg-I
than Arg-I
talking Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
phone Arg-I
. O

For O
another O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
one Arg-I
’s Arg-I
computer Arg-I
or Arg-I
Internet Arg-I
has Arg-I
any Arg-I
breakdown Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
/ Arg-I
she Arg-I
can Arg-I
call Arg-I
the Arg-I
MIS Arg-I
staff Arg-I
to Arg-I
fix Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
working Arg-B
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
has Arg-I
many Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
that Arg-I
will Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
lower Arg-I
the Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
of Arg-I
works Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
easily Arg-I
distracted Arg-I
while Arg-I
working Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
concentrate Arg-I
on Arg-I
work Arg-I
if Arg-I
people Arg-I
can Arg-I
grab Arg-I
the Arg-I
TV Arg-I
remote Arg-I
or Arg-I
some Arg-I
junk Arg-I
foods Arg-I
right Arg-I
away Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
while Arg-B
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
supervising Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
thus Arg-I
raises Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
loafing Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
miss Arg-I
the Arg-I
important Arg-I
events Arg-I
happening Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
office Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
some Arg-I
announcements Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
boss Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
working Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
office Arg-I
is Arg-I
obviously Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
working Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
with Arg-I
colleges Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
it Arg-I
provides Arg-I
a Arg-I
real Arg-I
working Arg-I
atmosphere Arg-I
that Arg-I
can Arg-I
never Arg-I
be Arg-I
grasped Arg-I
if Arg-I
people Arg-I
choose Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
at Arg-I
home Arg-I
. O

The O
ability O
to O
relate O
well O
to O
people O
is O
more O
important O
I O
think O
that O
No O
factor O
is O
important O
enough O
by O
itself O
to O
succeed O
in O
any O
situations O
. O

We O
should O
consider O
many O
factors O
and O
choose O
the O
best O
of O
them O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
both Arg-B
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
to Arg-I
relate Arg-I
well Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
and Arg-I
studying Arg-I
hard Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
for O
following O
reasons O
: O
We Arg-B
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
theoritical Arg-I
basis Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
done Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
identify Arg-I
skills Arg-I
required Arg-I
for Arg-I
our Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
and Arg-I
work Arg-I
on Arg-I
mastering Arg-I
and Arg-I
learning Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
study Arg-I
them Arg-I
hard Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
doing Arg-I
our Arg-I
job Arg-I
better Arg-I
and Arg-I
quicker Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
someone Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
industrial Arg-I
engineer Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
should Arg-I
study Arg-I
his Arg-I
technical Arg-I
courses Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
so Arg-I
that Arg-I
he Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
them Arg-I
well Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
studying Arg-B
hard Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
to Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

One Arg-B
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
other Arg-I
factors Arg-I
for Arg-I
success Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
future Arg-I
job Arg-I
is Arg-I
effective Arg-I
commuincation Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
relating Arg-I
well Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
friends Arg-I
and O
therefore O
we Arg-B
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
network Arg-I
of Arg-I
communication Arg-I
. O

Commuincation Arg-B
can Arg-I
bring Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
need Arg-I
help Arg-I
with Arg-I
getting Arg-I
a Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
commuincating Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
offering Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
whom Arg-I
you Arg-I
treat Arg-I
well Arg-I
and O
therefore O
they Arg-B
respect Arg-I
you Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
your Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

Or O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
salesman Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
store Arg-I
or Arg-I
any Arg-I
other Arg-I
place Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
relating Arg-I
well Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
customers Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
chance Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
coming Arg-I
back Arg-I
again Arg-I
and Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
your Arg-I
regular Arg-I
customers Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
relating Arg-B
well Arg-I
to Arg-I
people Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
another Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
. O

In O
sum O
, O
though O
some O
people O
may O
disagree O
with O
me O
, O
as O
I O
explained O
my O
reasons O
and O
examples O
above O
, O
none O
of O
those O
factors O
are O
important O
and O
sufficient O
enough O
by O
themselves O
and O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
notice Arg-I
to Arg-I
both Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
because O
each Arg-B
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
has Arg-I
its Arg-I
own Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
. O

The O
advertising O
is O
the O
main O
cause O
of O
unhealthy O
eating O
habits O
Advertising O
is O
becoming O
part O
of O
our O
modern O
society O
. O

They O
penetrate O
into O
people O
's O
life O
, O
affecting O
people O
's O
choices O
in O
different O
things O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
debate O
whether O
advertising O
has O
positive O
influences O
on O
people O
's O
life O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
that O
advertising O
must O
be O
blamed O
for O
the O
unhealthy O
eating O
habits O
, O
while O
others O
believe O
that O
there O
are O
still O
some O
other O
factors O
directing O
people O
's O
judgments O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B
advertising Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
cause Arg-I
of Arg-I
unhealthy Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
entirely Arg-I
decisive Arg-I
on Arg-I
personal Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habit Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
key Arg-I
to Arg-I
forming Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
eating Arg-I
pattern Arg-I
lies Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
concept Arg-I
of Arg-I
wholesome Arg-I
diets Arg-I
and Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
control Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
sure O
that O
advertising Arg-B
always Arg-I
makes Arg-I
the Arg-I
products Arg-I
so Arg-I
tempting Arg-I
, Arg-I
regardless Arg-I
of Arg-I
whether Arg-I
they Arg-I
might Arg-I
bring Arg-I
negative Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
human Arg-I
body Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
only Arg-I
information Arg-I
source Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
still Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
different Arg-I
viewpoints Arg-I
about Arg-I
foods Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
sources Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
news Arg-I
or Arg-I
magazines Arg-I
. O

As Arg-B
long Arg-I
as Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
clear Arg-I
about Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
body Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
persistently Arg-I
keep Arg-I
track Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
successfully Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
from Arg-I
those Arg-I
temptations Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
not Arg-I
persuasive Arg-I
if Arg-I
people Arg-I
just Arg-I
blame Arg-I
the Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
sector Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
fast Arg-I
- Arg-I
food Arg-I
company Arg-I
for Arg-I
making Arg-I
them Arg-I
so Arg-I
fat Arg-I
and Arg-I
not Arg-I
reassess Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
in Arg-B
the Arg-I
era Arg-I
when Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
becoming Arg-I
conscious Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
, Arg-I
some Arg-I
companies Arg-I
are Arg-I
actually Arg-I
aiming Arg-I
at Arg-I
this Arg-I
rising Arg-I
trend Arg-I
and Arg-I
start Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
foods Arg-I
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
advertising Arg-B
may Arg-I
even Arg-I
bring Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Think Arg-B
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
recently Arg-I
popular Arg-I
organic Arg-I
foods Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
claimed Arg-I
to Arg-I
grow Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
environment Arg-I
without Arg-I
pesticide Arg-I
and Arg-I
those Arg-I
crude Arg-I
foods Arg-I
in Arg-I
which Arg-I
less Arg-I
salt Arg-I
or Arg-I
less Arg-I
sugar Arg-I
are Arg-I
added Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
main Arg-I
traits Arg-I
that Arg-I
advertising Arg-I
is Arg-I
hitting Arg-I
on Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
overall Arg-I
results Arg-I
are Arg-I
good Arg-I
. O

In O
these O
cases O
, O
the Arg-B
advertising Arg-I
industry Arg-I
bolsters Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
having Arg-I
a Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
advertising Arg-B
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
the Arg-I
primary Arg-I
reason Arg-I
of Arg-I
unhealthy Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
build Arg-I
- Arg-I
up Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
concept Arg-I
about Arg-I
healthy Arg-I
eating Arg-I
habits Arg-I
and Arg-I
self Arg-I
- Arg-I
control Arg-I
that Arg-I
really Arg-I
matter Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
advertising Arg-B
might Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
healthier Arg-I
eating Arg-I
customs Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
growing Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
living Arg-I
under Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
inevitable O
to O
be O
exposed O
to O
the O
environment O
full O
of O
advertisements O
but O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
our O
right O
to O
choose O
is O
taken O
away O
. O

We O
will O
always O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
our O
own O
lifestyles O
. O

Learning O
facts O
has O
more O
subsequent O
advantages O
for O
students O
' O
future O
lives O

There O
are O
many O
debates O
regarding O
whether O
understanding O
ideas O
and O
concepts O
is O
more O
essential O
than O
learning O
facts O
for O
students O
or O
not O
. O

Although O
multitudes O
of O
people O
think O
that O
knowledge O
of O
ideas O
and O
concepts O
is O
more O
vital O
for O
students O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
conviction O
that O
learning Arg-B
facts Arg-I
has Arg-I
more Arg-I
subsequent Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
future Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
I O
will O
state O
my O
reasons O
for O
this O
choice O
. O

First O
, O
when Arg-B
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
facts Arg-I
more Arg-I
in Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
ready Arg-I
for Arg-I
facing Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
own Arg-I
life Arg-I
after Arg-I
their Arg-I
graduations Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
more Arg-B
information Arg-I
about Arg-I
facts Arg-I
would Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
more Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
other Arg-I
that Arg-I
only Arg-I
their Arg-I
concepts Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
to Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
out Arg-I
of Arg-I
school Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
their Arg-I
problems Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
it Arg-B
would Arg-I
improve Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
social Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
students Arg-I
only Arg-I
rely Arg-I
on Arg-I
concepts Arg-I
and Arg-I
ideas Arg-I
theorically Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
not Arg-I
realize Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
mind Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
should Arg-I
understand Arg-I
objects Arg-I
more Arg-I
that Arg-I
concepts Arg-I
to Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
the Arg-I
ability Arg-I
of Arg-I
analyzing Arg-I
matters Arg-I
well Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
if Arg-B
they Arg-I
deal Arg-I
more Arg-I
with Arg-I
facts Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
realize Arg-I
social Arg-I
situations Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
social Arg-I
communication Arg-I
in Arg-I
everyday Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
these Arg-B
way Arg-I
students Arg-I
are Arg-I
teached Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
their Arg-I
fears Arg-I
and Arg-I
concerns Arg-I
in Arg-I
facing Arg-I
facts Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
when Arg-B
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
understands Arg-I
a Arg-I
fact Arg-I
and Arg-I
its Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
, Arg-I
he Arg-I
or Arg-I
she Arg-I
can Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
it Arg-I
more Arg-I
confidently Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
concerns Arg-B
and Arg-I
anxieties Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
destructive Arg-I
in Arg-I
everybody Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
can Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
person Arg-I
to Arg-I
progress Arg-I
and Arg-I
thrive Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
position Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
learning Arg-B
facts Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
in Arg-I
both Arg-I
social Arg-I
and Arg-I
individual Arg-I
life Arg-I
in O
the O
view O
of O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
. O

Students Arg-B
would Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
social Arg-I
positions Arg-I
and Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
their Arg-I
problems Arg-I
in Arg-I
positive Arg-I
ways Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
intend Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
confidence Arg-I
manner Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Financial O
support O
for O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
debates O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O
in O
contrast O
with O
the O
main O
classes O
. O

It O
is O
very O
subjective O
decision O
for O
students O
to O
have O
or O
not O
have O
these O
facilities O
. O

Although O
multitudes O
of O
people O
think O
that O
sports O
and O
social O
activities O
are O
not O
as O
necessary O
as O
academic O
subjects O
in O
colleges O
, O
I O
think O
that O
these Arg-B
activities Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
lives Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
I O
will O
state O
my O
reason O
for O
this O
choice O
. O

First O
, O
besides Arg-B
the Arg-I
good Arg-I
body Arg-I
shape Arg-I
, Arg-I
sports Arg-I
have Arg-I
very Arg-I
vital Arg-I
effects Arg-I
on Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
healthfulness Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
our Arg-B
body Arg-I
and Arg-I
moral Arg-I
health Arg-I
depend Arg-I
to Arg-I
physical Arg-I
activities Arg-I
directly Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
last Arg-B
month Arg-I
I Arg-I
had Arg-I
very Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
exam Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
forced Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
for Arg-I
one Arg-I
week Arg-I
back Arg-I
to Arg-I
back Arg-I
. O

After Arg-B
that Arg-I
exam Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
felt Arg-I
depressed Arg-I
and Arg-I
exhausted Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
I Arg-B
decided Arg-I
to Arg-I
go Arg-I
to Arg-I
gym Arg-I
to Arg-I
recuperate Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
responded Arg-I
very Arg-I
well Arg-I
! O

As O
a O
result O
, O
sports Arg-B
are Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
acquire Arg-I
their Arg-I
energy Arg-I
and Arg-I
health Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
besides Arg-B
the Arg-I
academic Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
awareness Arg-I
of Arg-I
social Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
important Arg-I
factor Arg-I
for Arg-I
human Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
practical O
epitome O
, O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
to Arg-I
present Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
after Arg-I
their Arg-I
graduation Arg-I
. O

Thus O
social Arg-B
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
's Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
different Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
social Arg-B
groups Arg-I
and Arg-I
classes Arg-I
are Arg-I
significant Arg-I
factors Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
in Arg-I
discussion Arg-I
and Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
real Arg-I
social Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

So O
, O
social Arg-B
activities Arg-I
have Arg-I
same Arg-I
rights Arg-I
to Arg-I
receive Arg-I
monetary Arg-I
support Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
bring Arg-I
about Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
happier Arg-I
and Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
fun Arg-I
and Arg-I
entertainments Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
we Arg-I
follow Arg-I
just Arg-I
one Arg-I
wing Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
life Arg-I
i.e. Arg-I
, Arg-I
studying Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
student Arg-I
, Arg-I
after Arg-I
some Arg-I
whiles Arg-I
it Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
boring Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
would Arg-I
n't Arg-I
have Arg-I
any Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
. O

Such Arg-B
activities Arg-I
can Arg-I
help Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
pick Arg-I
up Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

In O
my O
perspective O
, O
more Arg-B
friends Arg-I
and Arg-I
new Arg-I
experience Arg-I
inspire Arg-I
the Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
of Arg-I
happiness Arg-I
and Arg-I
excitement Arg-I
in Arg-I
me Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
conviction O
that O
sports Arg-B
and Arg-I
social Arg-I
activities Arg-I
should Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
analogous Arg-I
concern Arg-I
and Arg-I
money Arg-I
in O
the O
view O
of O
above O
- O
mentioned O
reasons O
. O

They Arg-B
bring Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
and Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
affect Arg-I
their Arg-I
future Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
in O
my O
own O
country O
or O
another O
country O
Knowing O
foreign O
language O
is O
became O
more O
and O
more O
important O
in O
this O
time O
. O

Many O
people O
pursue O
to O
study O
foreign O
language O
. O

There O
are O
two O
options O
to O
learn O
foreign O
language O
. O

First O
is O
stay O
in O
homeland O
to O
study O
foreign O
language O
. O

The O
second O
option O
is O
that O
go O
to O
study O
in O
another O
place O
that O
foreign O
language O
are O
spoken O
. O

Going Arg-B
to Arg-I
another Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
language Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

I O
will O
give O
reasons O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
going Arg-B
to Arg-I
another Arg-I
country Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
language Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
good Arg-I
environment Arg-I
to Arg-I
stimulate Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
everyone Arg-B
around Arg-I
me Arg-I
speaks Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
then Arg-I
I Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
myself Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
even Arg-I
buy Arg-I
food Arg-I
to Arg-I
sacrifice Arg-I
my Arg-I
hunger Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
environment Arg-I
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
develop Arg-I
myself Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
that Arg-I
speak Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
having Arg-B
friend Arg-I
that Arg-I
speaks Arg-I
another Arg-I
language Arg-I
is Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
professional Arg-I
in Arg-I
that Arg-I
language Arg-I
faster Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
English Arg-B
school Arg-I
in Arg-I
outside Arg-I
my Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
people Arg-I
that Arg-I
come Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
places Arg-I
and Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
languages Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
only Arg-I
language Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
talk Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
friends Arg-I
is Arg-I
English Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I Arg-B
could Arg-I
talk Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friend Arg-I
without Arg-I
worrying Arg-I
about Arg-I
speaking Arg-I
wrong Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
reason Arg-I
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
progress Arg-I
in Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
faster Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
personally O
believe O
that O
learning Arg-B
language Arg-I
from Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
than Arg-I
learning Arg-I
language Arg-I
in Arg-I
home Arg-I
country Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
myself Arg-I
to Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
other Arg-I
people Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
in Arg-B
foreign Arg-I
country Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
speak Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
with Arg-I
my Arg-I
friends Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
form Arg-I
another Arg-I
country Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
choice Arg-I
for Arg-I
me Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
language Arg-I
. O

Getting O
opinions O
from O
many O
sources O
could O
augment O
people O

performance O
. O

Getting O
opinions O
from O
many O
sources O
could O
augment O
people O
's O
performance O
. O

Thereby O
, O
evaluating O
from O
students O
is O
one O
of O
the O
ways O
to O
improve O
quality O
of O
educational O
system O
. O

Not O
only O
teachers O
could O
amplify O
their O
performance O
but O
the O
whole O
education O
system O
are O
also O
improve O
performance O
from O
evaluation O
made O
by O
students O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
notion O
that O
students Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
asked Arg-I
to Arg-I
evaluate Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
Evaluating Arg-B
teachers Arg-I
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
students Arg-I
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
' Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
evaluation Arg-B
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
students Arg-I
is Arg-I
similar Arg-I
to Arg-I
feedback Arg-I
from Arg-I
customer Arg-I
that Arg-I
business Arg-I
owners Arg-I
need Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
product Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
might Arg-I
complain Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
spoke Arg-I
too Arg-I
fast Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
could Arg-I
not Arg-I
catch Arg-I
up Arg-I
on Arg-I
information Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
teachers Arg-B
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
by Arg-I
speaking Arg-I
slower Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
sure Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
could Arg-I
get Arg-I
all Arg-I
information Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
give Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
evaluating Arg-B
from Arg-I
students Arg-I
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
' Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

Additionally O
, O
this Arg-B
evaluation Arg-I
from Arg-I
students Arg-I
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
schools Arg-I
' Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
could Arg-I
augment Arg-I
their Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
When Arg-B
school Arg-I
gather Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
performance Arg-I
, Arg-I
school Arg-I
are Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
higher Arg-I
quality Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in Arg-B
many Arg-I
cooperation Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Microsoft Arg-I
that Arg-I
could Arg-I
produce Arg-I
many Arg-I
great Arg-I
products Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
employees Arg-I
whose Arg-I
performance Arg-I
are Arg-I
very Arg-I
high Arg-I
. O

Schools Arg-B
could Arg-I
produce Arg-I
intellectual Arg-I
students Arg-I
because O
school Arg-B
have Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
quality Arg-I
from Arg-I
evaluation Arg-I
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
get Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
advantage Arg-I
from Arg-I
evaluation Arg-I
is Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

Students Arg-B
could Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
class Arg-I
that Arg-I
have Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
who Arg-I
have Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
and Arg-I
greater Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

Because O
teachers Arg-B
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
adapt Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
they Arg-I
teach Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
their Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
, O
students Arg-B
could Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
their Arg-I
subject Arg-I
easily Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
students Arg-B
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
study Arg-I
from Arg-I
great Arg-I
schools Arg-I
which Arg-I
have Arg-I
great Arg-I
performance Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
, Arg-I
graduate Arg-I
with Arg-I
great Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
to Arg-I
survive Arg-I
in Arg-I
next Arg-I
steps Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
statement O
that O
school Arg-B
should Arg-I
ask Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
evaluate Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
because O
teachers Arg-B
could Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
performance Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
schools Arg-B
are Arg-I
also Arg-I
improve Arg-I
their Arg-I
quality Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
high Arg-I
performance Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
students Arg-B
are Arg-I
easy Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
their Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
evaluate Arg-I
their Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Keep O
trying O
and O
never O
stop O
working O
for O
your O
goals O
" O
Keep O
running O
! O
, O
" O
shouted O
from O
my O
heart O
but O
my O
legs O
can O
hardly O
move O
. O

During O
running O
for O
20 O
Kilometers O
in O
a O
marathon O
running O
tournament O
2014 O
, O
I O
saw O
some O
people O
stopped O
running O
while O
the O
others O
fought O
until O
their O
last O
minute O
. O

At O
some O
moment O
, O
my O
body O
was O
telling O
me O
to O
stop O
but O
the O
choice O
that O
I O
made O
was O
on O
the O
contrary O
. O

I O
did O
not O
stop O
and O
won O
a O
medal O
goals O
in O
my O
life O
at O
the O
age O
of O
nearly O
thirty O
. O

From O
this O
experience O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
a Arg-B
person Arg-I
should Arg-I
keep Arg-I
trying Arg-I
for Arg-I
his Arg-I
goals Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
committing Arg-B
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
goal Arg-I
helps Arg-I
creating Arg-I
personal Arg-I
worth Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
realized Arg-I
the Arg-I
true Arg-I
potential Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
body Arg-I
and Arg-I
mind Arg-I
as Arg-I
I Arg-I
decided Arg-I
to Arg-I
train Arg-I
myself Arg-I
hard Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
if Arg-I
I Arg-I
were Arg-I
not Arg-I
to Arg-I
win Arg-I
this Arg-I
medal Arg-I
, Arg-I
I Arg-I
acknowledged Arg-I
the Arg-I
great Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
endeavor Arg-I
as Arg-I
I Arg-I
could Arg-I
keep Arg-I
my Arg-I
tired Arg-I
legs Arg-I
running Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
one Arg-B
who Arg-I
learns Arg-I
the Arg-I
great Arg-I
difficulty Arg-I
will Arg-I
become Arg-I
stronger Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
remembered Arg-I
how Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
suffered Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
round Arg-I
when Arg-I
I Arg-I
was Arg-I
last Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
touched Arg-I
the Arg-I
line Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I Arg-B
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
up Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
believed Arg-I
that Arg-I
I Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
better Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
round Arg-I
because O
I Arg-B
knew Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
improve Arg-I
myself Arg-I
. O

I Arg-B
had Arg-I
been Arg-I
a Arg-I
loser Arg-I
for Arg-I
a Arg-I
thousand Arg-I
time Arg-I
before Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
winning Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
from Arg-I
losing Arg-I
in Arg-I
each Arg-I
competition Arg-I
makes Arg-I
me Arg-I
stronger Arg-I
. O

Thirdly O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
we Arg-B
, Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
average Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
might Arg-I
feel Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
responsibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
our Arg-I
goal Arg-I
is Arg-I
too Arg-I
heavy Arg-I
to Arg-I
carry Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
responsibility Arg-I
is Arg-I
worthy Arg-I
of Arg-I
carrying Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
the Arg-I
distance Arg-I
is Arg-I
longer Arg-I
and Arg-I
harder Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
runner Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
go Arg-I
beyond Arg-I
his Arg-I
limit Arg-I
will Arg-I
proud Arg-I
of Arg-I
himself Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
can Arg-I
feel Arg-I
the Arg-I
sweetness Arg-I
of Arg-I
triumph Arg-I
because O
he Arg-B
did Arg-I
not Arg-I
stop Arg-I
pursing Arg-I
his Arg-I
goal Arg-I
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
one Arg-B
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
give Arg-I
up Arg-I
, O
as O
the Arg-B
true Arg-I
reward Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
dignity Arg-I
. O

Anyone Arg-B
who Arg-I
wants Arg-I
to Arg-I
achieve Arg-I
the Arg-I
goal Arg-I
should Arg-I
acknowledge Arg-I
that Arg-I
his Arg-I
effort Arg-I
and Arg-I
experience Arg-I
from Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
helps Arg-I
him Arg-I
understand Arg-I
his Arg-I
true Arg-I
potential Arg-I
and Arg-I
increase Arg-I
his Arg-I
strength Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
ultimately Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
prompt Arg-I
him Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
ready Arg-I
for Arg-I
overcoming Arg-I
the Arg-I
greater Arg-I
challenge Arg-I
in Arg-I
his Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

Technology O
makes O
people O
's O
lives O
simpler O
rather O
than O
complicated O

Believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
nowadays O
people O
are O
always O
confronted O
with O
a O
problem O
that O
whether O
technology O
makes O
their O
life O
simpler O
or O
not O
, O
thus O
making O
them O
confused O
. O

Many O
people O
advocate O
that O
technology O
makes O
their O
life O
easier O
. O

Although O
I O
conceded O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
aspects Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
convenience Arg-I
it Arg-I
brings Arg-I
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

In O
what O
follows O
, O
I O
will O
illustrate O
my O
point O
of O
view O
. O

First O
, O
when Arg-B
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
field Arg-I
of Arg-I
transportation Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
doubt Arg-I
that Arg-I
the Arg-I
technology Arg-I
in Arg-I
automobile Arg-I
has Arg-I
made Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
simpler Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
a Arg-I
private Arg-I
car Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
reach Arg-I
the Arg-I
destination Arg-I
in Arg-I
another Arg-I
city Arg-I
just Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
vehicle Arg-I
. O

Alternatively O
, O
if Arg-B
you Arg-I
would Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
trip Arg-I
across Arg-I
the Arg-I
ocean Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
plane Arg-I
can Arg-I
carry Arg-I
you Arg-I
there Arg-I
in Arg-I
only Arg-I
a Arg-I
few Arg-I
hours Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
imagine Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
ancient Arg-I
times Arg-I
. O

Second O
, O
technology Arg-B
also Arg-I
makes Arg-I
teaching Arg-I
simpler Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
, Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
write Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
convey Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
chalkboard Arg-I
, Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
waste Arg-I
of Arg-I
time Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
fatigue Arg-I
of Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

With Arg-B
the Arg-I
advent Arg-I
of Arg-I
iPads Arg-I
in Arg-I
e Arg-I
- Arg-I
learning Arg-I
, Arg-I
paper Arg-I
books Arg-I
become Arg-I
unnecessary Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
does Arg-I
the Arg-I
blackboards Arg-I
, O
it O
is O
because O
all Arg-B
the Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
information Arg-I
are Arg-I
stored Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
iPads Arg-I
, Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
single Arg-I
click Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
would Arg-I
appear Arg-I
right Arg-I
before Arg-I
your Arg-I
eyes Arg-I
at Arg-I
once Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
more Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
the Arg-B
cell Arg-I
phone Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
simply Arg-I
a Arg-I
tool Arg-I
to Arg-I
deliver Arg-I
messages Arg-I
to Arg-I
your Arg-I
contacts Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
distance Arg-I
, Arg-I
now Arg-I
are Arg-I
playing Arg-I
a Arg-I
role Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
just Arg-I
a Arg-I
phone Arg-I
in Arg-I
social Arg-I
communications Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
folks Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
check Arg-I
their Arg-I
Facebooks Arg-I
, Arg-I
Twitters Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
Forums Arg-I
accounts Arg-I
every Arg-I
minute Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
add Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
games Arg-B
on Arg-I
their Arg-I
phone Arg-I
exert Arg-I
a Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
fascination Arg-I
on Arg-I
teenagers Arg-I
, Arg-I
leading Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
problem Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
got Arg-I
addicted Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
phones Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
making Arg-B
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
more Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
and Arg-I
tired Arg-I
. O

Based O
on O
the O
factors O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
a O
conclusion O
can O
be O
drawn O
that O
although O
technology Arg-B
may Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
life Arg-I
complicated Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
cases Arg-I
, O
the Arg-B
convenience Arg-I
it Arg-I
brings Arg-I
in Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
are Arg-I
significant Arg-I
. O

More O
important O
to O
work O
quickly O
and O
risk O
making O
mistakes O
Organizations O
, O
these O
days O
, O
seek O
to O
find O
people O
who O
can O
work O
extraordinary O
fast O
and O
carefully O
. O

These O
people O
play O
an O
important O
role O
to O
increase O
effectiveness O
of O
a O
company O
. O

Working Arg-B
fast Arg-I
yet Arg-I
risky Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
place Arg-I
near Arg-I
the Arg-I
ideal Arg-I
goal Arg-I
mentioned O
before O
. O

I O
am O
totally O
agrees O
with O
the O
statement O
for O
some O
reasons O
. O

Trying Arg-B
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
skills Arg-I
, Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
two Arg-I
places Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
week Arg-I
and Arg-I
gaining Arg-I
more Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
reasons Arg-I
which Arg-I
take Arg-I
into Arg-I
account Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
causes Arg-I
of Arg-I
my Arg-I
choice Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
if Arg-B
persons Arg-I
work Arg-I
rapidly Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
. O

Attending Arg-B
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
classes Arg-I
which Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
the Arg-I
skills Arg-I
of Arg-I
employees Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
considered Arg-I
as Arg-I
an Arg-I
absolutely Arg-I
effective Arg-I
parameter Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
people Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
should Arg-I
increase Arg-I
their Arg-I
speed Arg-I
at Arg-I
work Arg-I
by Arg-I
studying Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
stares Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
working Arg-I
so Arg-I
slowly Arg-I
. O

He Arg-B
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
threatened Arg-I
by Arg-I
his Arg-I
boss Arg-I
who Arg-I
was Arg-I
going Arg-I
to Arg-I
fire Arg-I
him Arg-I
. O

My Arg-B
friend Arg-I
went Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
course Arg-I
where Arg-I
he Arg-I
learned Arg-I
how Arg-I
should Arg-I
work Arg-I
rapidly Arg-I

and Arg-I
now Arg-I
he Arg-I
is Arg-I
working Arg-I
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
people Arg-B
prone Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
in Arg-I
two Arg-I
or Arg-I
three Arg-I
firms Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
week Arg-I
because O
the Arg-B
expenses Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
increased Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
work Arg-I
just Arg-I
in Arg-I
one Arg-I
organization Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
earn Arg-I
enough Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
fact Arg-I
pushes Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
faster Arg-I
and Arg-I
faster Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
because O
applying Arg-B
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
abroad Arg-I
needs Arg-I
a Arg-I
lot Arg-I
of Arg-I
money Arg-I
, O
I Arg-B
am Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
two Arg-I
organization Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
salary Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
more Arg-I
chances Arg-I
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
people Arg-B
who Arg-I
work Arg-I
slowly Arg-I
can Arg-I
no Arg-I
longer Arg-I
handle Arg-I
more Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
show Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
workplace Arg-I
that Arg-I
you Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
one Arg-I
who Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
other Arg-I
even Arg-I
carelessly Arg-I
, Arg-I
your Arg-I
boss Arg-I
will Arg-I
assign Arg-I
you Arg-I
more Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
do Arg-I
them Arg-I
fast Arg-I
too Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
acknowledgement Arg-I
of Arg-I
your Arg-I
boss Arg-I
encourages Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
harder Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
turns Arg-I
you Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
who Arg-I
has Arg-I
skill Arg-I
of Arg-I
working Arg-I
without Arg-I
hesitation Arg-I
. O

Even Arg-B
if Arg-I
we Arg-I
ignore Arg-I
this Arg-I
result Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
token Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
can Arg-I
get Arg-I
higher Arg-I
position Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
completely O
approve O
of O
the O
statement O
which O
says O
people Arg-B
should Arg-I
work Arg-I
faster Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
risky Arg-I
. O

Gaining Arg-B
more Arg-I
skills Arg-I
by Arg-I
study Arg-I
, Arg-I
having Arg-I
more Arg-I
than Arg-I
one Arg-I
job Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
handling Arg-I
more Arg-I
tasks Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
of Arg-I
it Arg-I
which Arg-I
overweighs Arg-I
its Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

I O
hope O
people O
gain O
this O
skill O
because O
after O
that O
they O
will O
endorse O
my O
choice O
. O

New O
building O
construction O
hold O
the O
right O
to O
gain O
more O
money O
from O
government O

The O
housing O
shortage O
is O
drawing O
more O
and O
more O
attention O
nowadays O
. O

And O
the O
cost O
of O
accommodation O
keeps O
growing O
these O
years O
. O

The O
necessity O
of O
governmental O
financial O
aid O
is O
extremely O
important O
. O

What Arg-B
government Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
into Arg-I
consideration Arg-I
at Arg-I
the Arg-I
first Arg-I
place Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
historic Arg-I
and Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
building Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
but Arg-I
new Arg-I
building Arg-I
construction Arg-I
. O

Building Arg-B
more Arg-I
accommodating Arg-I
constructions Arg-I
meets Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
basic Arg-I
need Arg-I
. O

People Arg-B
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
live Arg-I
a Arg-I
harmonious Arg-I
life Arg-I
if Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
decent Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
housing Arg-I
grows Arg-I
continuously Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
place Arg-I
to Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
luxury Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
middle Arg-I
class Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
low Arg-I
class Arg-I
. O

Then O
, O
ordinary Arg-B
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
the Arg-I
younger Arg-I
generation Arg-I
, Arg-I
will Arg-I
fall Arg-I
into Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
pattern Arg-I
- Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
pay Arg-I
bills Arg-I
for Arg-I
housing Arg-I
, Arg-I
work Arg-I
; Arg-I
and Arg-I
I Arg-I
am Arg-I
sure Arg-I
that Arg-I
it Arg-I
will Arg-I
increase Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
dissatisfaction Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Because O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
working Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
fair Arg-I
of Arg-I
losing Arg-I
their Arg-I
accommodation Arg-I
always Arg-I
lingers Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
will Arg-I
limit Arg-I
their Arg-I
efficiency Arg-I
. O

And O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
rescue Arg-I
them Arg-I
from Arg-I
this Arg-I
, O
because O
only Arg-B
a Arg-I
government Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
finally Arg-I
last Arg-I
; Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
cohesiveness Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
. O

Otherwise O
, O
another O
vital O
reason O
why O
new Arg-B
building Arg-I
construction Arg-I
deserves Arg-I
more Arg-I
governmental Arg-I
investment Arg-I
lies O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
it Arg-B
requires Arg-I
far Arg-I
more Arg-I
resource Arg-I
compare Arg-I
to Arg-I
old Arg-I
building Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
. O

Build Arg-B
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
building Arg-I
has Arg-I
following Arg-I
prerequisites Arg-I
, Arg-I
land Arg-I
that Arg-I
has Arg-I
been Arg-I
sold Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
via Arg-I
formal Arg-I
procedures Arg-I
, Arg-I
a Arg-I
reliable Arg-I
construction Arg-I
company Arg-I
and Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I
amount Arg-I
of Arg-I
labor Arg-I
. O

Except O
these O
, O
hundreds Arg-B
of Arg-I
problems Arg-I
would Arg-I
occur Arg-I
during Arg-I
the Arg-I
construction Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
only Arg-B
government Arg-I
can Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
it Arg-I
by Arg-I
utilizing Arg-I
its Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
resource Arg-I
like Arg-I
dollars Arg-I
and Arg-I
effectiveness Arg-I
. O

Generally O
, O
personally O
speaking O
, O
I O
believe O
new Arg-B
building Arg-I
construction Arg-I
hold Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
gain Arg-I
more Arg-I
money Arg-I
from Arg-I
government Arg-I
. O

Replacing O
old O
buildings O
is O
important O
for O
any O
city O
but O
it O
should O
not O
affect O
historic O
houses O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
any Arg-I
city Arg-I
to Arg-I
replace Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
with Arg-I
new Arg-I
ones Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
these Arg-I
revolutions Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
include Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
show Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
ancestors Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they Arg-B
can Arg-I
develop Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
industries Arg-I
by Arg-I
attracting Arg-I
tourists Arg-I

Historic Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
answer Arg-I
many Arg-I
questions Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
mysterious Arg-I
about Arg-I
our Arg-I
previous Arg-I

; Arg-I
thereby Arg-I
no Arg-I
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
determine Arg-I
the Arg-I
price Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I

They Arg-B

the Arg-I

previous Arg-I
generations Arg-I
who Arg-I
lived Arg-I

thousands Arg-I

. O

By Arg-B
investigating Arg-I
about Arg-I
their Arg-I
structures Arg-I
, Arg-I
we Arg-I
can Arg-I
understand Arg-I
how Arg-I
much Arg-I
they Arg-I
knew Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
architecture Arg-I
of Arg-I
building Arg-I
. O

In O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
historic Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
treasures Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
provide Arg-I
an Arg-I
area Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
lessons Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
advantage Arg-I
of Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
is Arg-I
their Arg-I
capabilities Arg-I
to Arg-I
attract Arg-I
more Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
interesting Arg-I
for Arg-I
most Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
way Arg-I
people Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
years Arg-I
ago Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
It Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
opportunities Arg-I
for Arg-I
any Arg-I
city Arg-I
having Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
new Arg-I
visitors Arg-I
. O

Historic Arg-B
building Arg-I
can Arg-I
develop Arg-I
other Arg-I
industries Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
restaurants Arg-I
or Arg-I
other Arg-I
food Arg-I
industries Arg-I
and Arg-I
handicrafts Arg-I
shops Arg-I
and Arg-I
so Arg-I
on Arg-I
. O

These O
are O
reasons O
that O
why O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
preserve Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
can Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
us Arg-I
financially Arg-I
by Arg-I
developing Arg-I
other Arg-I
industries Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
symbols Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
nations Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
can Arg-I
show Arg-I
the Arg-I
historical Arg-I
culture Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
previous Arg-I
ancestors Arg-I
. O

Attending O
boys O
and O
girls O
in O
a O
same O
school O
would O
bring O
many O
advantages O
Women O
or O
men O
almost O
need O
each O
other O
in O
full O
of O
life O
even O
in O
school O
. O

Although O
some O
experts O
believe O
that O
common O
schools O
for O
both O
female O
and O
male O
lead O
to O
diminish O
their O
efficiency O
in O
education O
, O
others O
view O
it O
as O
a O
helpful O
way O
to O
recognize O
the O
opposite O
gender O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
boys Arg-B
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
should Arg-I
study Arg-I
together Arg-I
in O
the O
sense O
that O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
and Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
behave Arg-I
with Arg-I
an Arg-I
opposite Arg-I
sex Arg-I
. O

School Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
small Arg-I
society Arg-I
for Arg-I
students Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
prepares Arg-I
them Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
future Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
attending Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
learn Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
view Arg-I
the Arg-I
opposite Arg-I
gender Arg-I
in Arg-I
classes Arg-I
as Arg-I
a Arg-I
friend Arg-I
or Arg-I
a Arg-I
classmate Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a Arg-B
boy Arg-I
would Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
speak Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
girl Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
situation Arg-I
and Arg-I
vice Arg-I
versa Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
would Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
ask Arg-I
her Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
cooperate Arg-I
with Arg-I
his Arg-I
study Arg-I
, Arg-I
how Arg-I
communicate Arg-I
with Arg-I
girls Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
group Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

Admittedly O
, O
when Arg-B
they Arg-I
study Arg-I
together Arg-I
and Arg-I
help Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
exercise Arg-I
the Arg-I
the Arg-I
real Arg-I
life Arg-I
as Arg-I
they Arg-I
age Arg-I
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
some O
experts O
believe O
that O
attending Arg-B
both Arg-I
girls Arg-I
and Arg-I
boys Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
same Arg-I
school Arg-I
cause Arg-I
many Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

By O
doing O
this O
, O
outdoors Arg-B
relationships Arg-I
may Arg-I
expand Arg-I
and Arg-I
it Arg-I
may Arg-I
accompany Arg-I
with Arg-I
sexual Arg-I
relationship Arg-I
and O
as O
result O
, O
their Arg-B
thoughts Arg-I
deviate Arg-I
from Arg-I
the Arg-I
studies Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
attending Arg-B
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
school Arg-I
having Arg-I
boys Arg-I
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
might Arg-I
be Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
for Arg-I
both Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
their Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Boys Arg-B
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
capabilities Arg-I
and Arg-I
abilities Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
, O
therefore O
they Arg-B
will Arg-I
study Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
. O

Indeed O
, O
Boys Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
seem Arg-I
weak Arg-I
in Arg-I
front Arg-I
of Arg-I
girls Arg-I
and Arg-I
vice Arg-I
versa Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the Arg-B
productivity Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
class Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
increased Arg-I
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
attending Arg-B
boys Arg-I
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
same Arg-I
school Arg-I
would Arg-I
bring Arg-I
many Arg-I
advantages Arg-I
. O

Taking Arg-B
part Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
study Arg-I
groups Arg-I
would Arg-I
increase Arg-I
student Arg-I
's Arg-I
motivation Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they Arg-B
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
the Arg-I
opposite Arg-I
gender Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
prepared Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
adult Arg-I
life Arg-I
where Arg-I
they Arg-I
almost Arg-I
will Arg-I
live Arg-I
or Arg-I
work Arg-I
together Arg-I
. O

The O
city O
which O
I O
enjoy O
the O
most O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
history O
and O
modernity O
The O
city O
where O
I O
was O
born O
used O
to O
be O
of O
a O
great O
antique O
beauty O
, O
which O
was O
surrounded O
with O
by O
lots O
of O
ancient O
style O
buildings O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
urbanization O
makes O
me O
only O
appreciate O
parts O
of O
those O
classic O
buildings O
in O
the O
pictures O
or O
in O
museums O
. O

In O
order O
to O
prevent O
the O
disappearance O
of O
the O
historic O
buildings O
, O
some O
citizens O
suggest O
the O
government O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
historic O
buildings O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
we Arg-B
should Arg-I
do Arg-I
our Arg-I
parts Arg-I
to Arg-I
do Arg-I
what Arg-I
ever Arg-I
it Arg-I
takes Arg-I
to Arg-I
protect Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
, Arg-I
letting Arg-I
next Arg-I
generations Arg-I
still Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
look Arg-I
at Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

Here O
are O
some O
reasons O
and O
examples O
to O
illustrate O
my O
viewpoint O
. O

Historic Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
have Arg-I
intrinsic Arg-I
values Arg-I
, O
because O
they Arg-B
are Arg-I
significant Arg-I
symbols Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
. O

Old Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
are Arg-I
reminders Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
city Arg-I
's Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
complexity Arg-I
. O

By Arg-B
seeing Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
-- Arg-I
whether Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
something Arg-I
famous Arg-I
or Arg-I
recognizably Arg-I
dramatic Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
witness Arg-I
the Arg-I
aesthetic Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
an Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
when Arg-B
somebody Arg-I
mentions Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
, Arg-I
China Arg-I
's Arg-I
capital Arg-I
city Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
will Arg-I
immediately Arg-I
have Arg-I
Capital Arg-I
Palace Arg-I
come Arg-I
to Arg-I
appear Arg-I
in Arg-I
your Arg-I
mind Arg-I
, O
because O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
remarkable Arg-I
sign Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
city Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
also Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
inevitable Arg-I
history Arg-I
of Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
, Arg-I
even Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
China Arg-I
. O

Depending Arg-B
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
study Arg-I
of Arg-I
Capital Arg-I
Palace Arg-I
, Arg-I
researchers Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
comprehensive Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
historic Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
make Arg-I
our Arg-I
lives Arg-I
more Arg-I
colorful Arg-I
, Arg-I
provide Arg-I
places Arg-I
for Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
bodies Arg-I
and Arg-I
minds Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
city Arg-I
is Arg-I
occupied Arg-I
with Arg-I
an Arg-I
abundance Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
houses Arg-I
and Arg-I
and Arg-I
high Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
which Arg-I
make Arg-I
it Arg-I
crowded Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
no Arg-I
rooms Arg-I
for Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
relax Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
warmth Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
materials Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
heart Arg-I
pine Arg-I
, Arg-I
marble Arg-I
, Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
old Arg-I
brick Arg-I
, Arg-I
all Arg-I
those Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
features Arg-I
call Arg-I
back Arg-I
of Arg-I
our Arg-I
inner Arg-I
peace Arg-I
. O

Lying Arg-B
under Arg-I
the Arg-I
roof Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
historic Arg-I
building Arg-I
or Arg-I
sitting Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
desk Arg-I
fill Arg-I
with Arg-I
history Arg-I
are Arg-I
both Arg-I
easy Arg-I
ways Arg-I
to Arg-I
forget Arg-I
life Arg-I
's Arg-I
little Arg-I
annoyance Arg-I
and Arg-I
feel Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
historic Arg-B
buildings Arg-I
can Arg-I
be Arg-I
a Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
maintenance Arg-I
fees Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
many Arg-I
historic Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
Beijing Arg-I
Place Arg-I
, Arg-I
Shanghai Arg-I
Artist Arg-I
Museum Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
all Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
support Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
financially Arg-I
by Arg-I
charging Arg-I
tens Arg-I
of Arg-I
thousands Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
. O

Our Arg-B
governments Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
happy Arg-I
with Arg-I
those Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
consequences Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
a Arg-I
majority Arg-I
of Arg-I
cities Arg-I
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
imitate Arg-I
this Arg-I
economical Arg-I
cycle Arg-I
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
the Arg-B
city Arg-I
which Arg-I
I Arg-I
enjoy Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
combination Arg-I
of Arg-I
history Arg-I
and Arg-I
modernity Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
the Arg-B
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
one Arg-I
- Arg-I
way Arg-I
street Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
chance Arg-I
to Arg-I
renovate Arg-I
to Arg-I
save Arg-I
a Arg-I
history Arg-I
site Arg-I
once Arg-I
it Arg-I
's Arg-I
gone Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
reality Arg-I
brings Arg-I
us Arg-I
to Arg-I
light Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
locating Arg-I
and Arg-I
saving Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
of Arg-I
historic Arg-I
significance Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
government Arg-B
should Arg-I
spend Arg-I
money Arg-I
on Arg-I
preservation Arg-I
of Arg-I
old Arg-I
buildings Arg-I
. O

There O
have O
been O
significant O
developments O
in O
the O
field O
of O
IT O
! O

Decade O
after O
decade O
, O
every O
day O
, O
scientists O
discover O
magnificent O
devices O
in O
the O
field O
of O
IT O
, O
such O
as O
interactive O
boards O
, O
multicore O
computers O
and O
laptops O
, O
tablets O
, O
which O
have O
an O
incredible O
resolution O
and O
also O
mobile O
phones O
, O
which O
have O
the O
power O
of O
a O
computer O
. O

World O
Wide O
Web O
and O
communication O
via O
email O
are O
some O
of O
the O
positive O
sides O
of O
information O
technology O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
some O
negative O
aspects O
. O

Firstly O
, O
connecting Arg-B
people Arg-I
by Arg-I
email Arg-I
is Arg-I
easy Arg-I
and Arg-I
fast Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
World Arg-B
Wide Arg-I
Web Arg-I
offers Arg-I
humanity Arg-I
to Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
they Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
know Arg-I
for Arg-I
less Arg-I
than Arg-I
10 Arg-I
seconds Arg-I
. O

These O
are O
two O
of O
the O
benefits O
, O
why O
IT O
is O
useful O
. O

Besides O
, O
nowadays Arg-B
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
entering Arg-I
into Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
really Arg-I
quick Arg-I
and O
scientists Arg-B
develop Arg-I
robots Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
people Arg-I
cope Arg-I
with Arg-I
their Arg-I
problems Arg-I
or Arg-I
just Arg-I
invent Arg-I
coffee Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
engines Arg-I
with Arg-I
integrated Arg-I
computers Arg-I
and Arg-I
etc Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
before Arg-B
centeries Arg-I
, Arg-I
there Arg-I
were Arg-I
not Arg-I
washing Arg-I
machines Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
clean Arg-I
your Arg-I
clothes Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
person Arg-I
do Arg-I
another Arg-I
job Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
some O
drawbacks O
about O
this O
issue O
. O

Scientists Arg-B
believe Arg-I
that Arg-I
one Arg-I
day Arg-I
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
face Arg-I
their Arg-I
developments Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
robots Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
succeed Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

All Arg-B
this Arg-I
inventions Arg-I
will Arg-I
try Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
control Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
Earth Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
IT Arg-B
discoveries Arg-I
are Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
have Arg-I
more Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
than Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
and Arg-I
people Arg-I
should Arg-I
know Arg-I
how Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
developments Arg-I
properly Arg-I
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
that O
the O
traditional O
skills O
will O
die O
out O
? O

With O
the O
development O
of O
technology O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
still O
necessary O
to O
protect O
the O
traditional O
skills O
and O
lifestyles O
leads O
to O
a O
drastic O
controversy O
which O
is O
becoming O
a O
public O
concern O
, O
especially O
considering O
the O
significant O
impact O
taken O
by O
technology O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
the Arg-B
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
valued Arg-I
and Arg-I
paid Arg-I
attention Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

Traditional Arg-B
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
lifestyles Arg-I
play Arg-I
important Arg-I
role Arg-I
in Arg-I
modern Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
terms Arg-I
of Arg-I
healthcare Arg-I
, Arg-I
environmental Arg-I
protection Arg-I
and Arg-I
cultural Arg-I
inherit Arg-I
. O

Although O
technology Arg-B
takes Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
to Arg-I
humankind Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
also Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
unhealthy Arg-I
behaviors Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
like Arg-I
sedentary Arg-I
lifestyle Arg-I
. O

Instead O
, O
traditional Arg-B
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
complimentary Arg-I
for Arg-I
modern Arg-I
life Arg-I
and Arg-I
highlight Arg-I
the Arg-I
importance Arg-I
of Arg-I
work Arg-I
life Arg-I
balance Arg-I
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
traditional Arg-B
skills Arg-I
rely Arg-I
little Arg-I
on Arg-I
fossil Arg-I
energy Arg-I
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
more Arg-I
environmentally Arg-I
- Arg-I
friendly Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
promoted Arg-I
to Arg-I
reduce Arg-I
the Arg-I
threat Arg-I
of Arg-I
climate Arg-I
change Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
those Arg-B
tradition Arg-I
- Arg-I
related Arg-I
things Arg-I
convey Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
values Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
are Arg-I
important Arg-I
foundation Arg-I
of Arg-I
modern Arg-I
civilization Arg-I
. O

Protection Arg-B
of Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
possibility Arg-I
to Arg-I
better Arg-I
understand Arg-I
ancient Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
utilize Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
tackle Arg-I
modern Arg-I
problems Arg-I
. O

Some O
people O
who O
hold O
different O
viewpoints O
may O
advocate O
that O
protecting Arg-B
traditions Arg-I
consume Arg-I
too Arg-I
much Arg-I
financial Arg-I
budget Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
incoming Arg-I
it Arg-I
takes Arg-I
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
this Arg-B
kind Arg-I
of Arg-I
business Arg-I
bring Arg-I
limited Arg-I
contribution Arg-I
to Arg-I
government Arg-I
finance Arg-I
, O
it O
should O
be O
emphasized O
that O
the Arg-B
expense Arg-I
is Arg-I
trivial Arg-I
compared Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
potential Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
authorities Arg-I
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
institutes Arg-I
should Arg-I
work Arg-I
closely Arg-I
together Arg-I
to Arg-I
promote Arg-I
the Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
as Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
realize Arg-I
the Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
protection Arg-B
of Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
is Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
entire Arg-I
society Arg-I
currently Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
contributes Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
next Arg-I
generation Arg-I
. O

Paying O
taxes O
is O
enough O
contribution O
from O
citizens O
Paying O
taxes O
is O
the O
obligation O
of O
citizens O
in O
almost O
every O
country O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
they O
have O
made O
enough O
contribution O
to O
the O
country O
by O
doing O
that O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
disagree O
with O
this O
view O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
all Arg-B
people Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
able Arg-I
to Arg-I
work Arg-I
should Arg-I
pay Arg-I
tax Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
, O
as O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
source Arg-I
of Arg-I
government Arg-I
's Arg-I
revenue Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
mainly Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
serve Arg-I
all Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
large Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tax Arg-I
is Arg-I
spent Arg-I
on Arg-I
national Arg-I
defence Arg-I
and Arg-I
in Arg-I
maintaining Arg-I
social Arg-I
stability Arg-I
, O
so O
that O
every Arg-B
one Arg-I
can Arg-I
work Arg-I
and Arg-I
live Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
peaceful Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
tax Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
pay Arg-I
the Arg-I
salaries Arg-I
of Arg-I
workers Arg-I
working Arg-I
in Arg-I
public Arg-I
service Arg-I
sectors Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
and Arg-I
police Arg-I
officers Arg-I
. O

Although O
these Arg-B
workers Arg-I
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
produce Arg-I
profit Arg-I
directly Arg-I
, O
what Arg-B
they Arg-I
do Arg-I
is Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
being Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
whole Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
citizens Arg-B
have Arg-I
other Arg-I
important Arg-I
responsibilities Arg-I
to Arg-I
fulfil Arg-I
apart Arg-I
from Arg-I
paying Arg-I
tax Arg-I
. O

As O
we O
know O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
impoverished Arg-I
or Arg-I
disabled Arg-I
people Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
needing Arg-I
help Arg-I
and Arg-I
support Arg-I
from Arg-I
others Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the Arg-B
government Arg-I
can Arg-I
provide Arg-I
some Arg-I
fund Arg-I
to Arg-I
ease Arg-I
their Arg-I
difficulties Arg-I
, O
but O
such Arg-B
financial Arg-I
help Arg-I
is Arg-I
usually Arg-I
far Arg-I
from Arg-I
enough Arg-I
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
aids Arg-B
from Arg-I
more Arg-I
capable Arg-I
or Arg-I
wealthier Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
are Arg-I
particularly Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
are Arg-I
a Arg-I
great Arg-I
complement Arg-I
to Arg-I
government Arg-I
support Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
responsibility Arg-I
all Arg-I
citizens Arg-I
should Arg-I
take Arg-I
is Arg-I
to Arg-I
maintain Arg-I
social Arg-I
stability Arg-I
together Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
force Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
are Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
society Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
policemen Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
can Arg-I
hire Arg-I
is Arg-I
limited Arg-I
. O

So O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
quite Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
residents Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
actions Arg-I
and Arg-I
ensure Arg-I
the Arg-I
safety Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
communities Arg-I
, Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
things Arg-I
like Arg-I
reporting Arg-I
suspicious Arg-I
activities Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
department Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it O
is O
a O
significant O
obligation O
of O
citizens O
to O
pay O
tax O
to O
the O
government O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
other Arg-I
critical Arg-I
obligations Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
, Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
our Arg-I
society Arg-I
function Arg-I
in Arg-I
an Arg-I
ordered Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

Using O
a O
computer O
every O
day O
can O
have O
more O
negative O
than O
positive O
effects O

In O
today O
's O
world O
, O
computer O
is O
an O
essential O
part O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

Around O
the O
globe O
, O
the O
effect O
is O
evident O
on O
children O
also O
. O

It Arg-B
is Arg-I
disagreed Arg-I
that Arg-I
computer Arg-I
can Arg-I
affect Arg-I
children Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
way Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
use Arg-I
a Arg-I
computer Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
daily Arg-I
basis Arg-I
. O

This O
will O
be O
proven O
by O
analyzing O
how O
computer Arg-B
assists Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
vast Arg-I
resources Arg-I
available Arg-I
over Arg-I
internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
effectively Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
develop Arg-I
some Arg-I
basic Arg-I
skills Arg-I
which Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
in Arg-I
future Arg-I
careers Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
best Arg-I
thing Arg-I
about Arg-I
internet Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
availability Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
text Arg-I
, Arg-I
image Arg-I
or Arg-I
video Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
almost Arg-I
everything Arg-I
and O
through Arg-B
computer Arg-I
children Arg-I
can Arg-I
access Arg-I
internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
gather Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
studying Arg-I
or Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
interested Arg-I
about Arg-I
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
students Arg-B
preparing Arg-I
for Arg-I
delivering Arg-I
speech Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
certain Arg-I
topic Arg-I
can Arg-I
browse Arg-I
through Arg-I
internet Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
each Arg-I
and Arg-I
every Arg-I
minute Arg-I
details Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
subject Arg-I
matter Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
's Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
get Arg-I
everything Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
same Arg-I
place Arg-I
unless Arg-I
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
familiar Arg-I
with Arg-I
computers Arg-I
. O

That O
is O
how O
, O
computer Arg-B
impacts Arg-I
children Arg-I
on Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
note Arg-I
. O

Nowadays O
, O
computers Arg-B
enable Arg-I
people Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
presentations Arg-I
, Arg-I
draw Arg-I
complex Arg-I
graphs Arg-I
and Arg-I
pictures Arg-I
, Arg-I
document Arg-I
thesis Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
simple Arg-I
though Arg-I
efficient Arg-I
way Arg-I
. O

When Arg-B
children Arg-I
are Arg-I
allowed Arg-I
to Arg-I
play Arg-I
around Arg-I
with Arg-I
computer Arg-I
from Arg-I
a Arg-I
very Arg-I
early Arg-I
age Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
get Arg-I
acquainted Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
previously Arg-I
mentioned Arg-I
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
become Arg-I
expert Arg-I
before Arg-I
facing Arg-I
professional Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
students Arg-B
who Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
prepare Arg-I
Microsoft Arg-I
PowerPoint Arg-I
presentation Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
school Arg-I
projects Arg-I
, Arg-I
get Arg-I
an Arg-I
edge Arg-I
over Arg-I
others Arg-I
at Arg-I
an Arg-I
early Arg-I
stage Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
career Arg-I
. O

From O
this O
, O
it Arg-B
's Arg-I
clear Arg-I
that Arg-I
computer Arg-I
has Arg-I
a Arg-I
positive Arg-I
effect Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

Following O
the O
demonstration O
of O
a O
computer O
's O
contribution O
in O
children O
's O
study O
and O
building O
skills O
which O
are O
to O
be O
used O
in O
their O
career O
afterwards O
, O
it O
is O
agreed O
that O
computer Arg-B
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
boon Arg-I
to Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

However O
, O
parents O
should O
advise O
and O
guide O
their O
children O
properly O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
misled O
. O

Foreign O
language O
instruction O
should O
begin O
in O
kindergarten O
Educational O
institutions O
have O
different O
systems O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
introducing O
foreign O
languages O
to O
children O
. O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
foreign O
language O
instruction O
should O
start O
in O
pre O
- O
school O
. O

However O
, O
those O
who O
disagree O
contend O
that O
this O
should O
be O
taught O
in O
later O
years O
. O

This O
issue O
has O
garnered O
some O
attention O
in O
the O
academe O
as O
it O
has O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
children O
's O
learning O
. O

I O
personally O
believe O
that O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
important Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
taught Arg-I
with Arg-I
a Arg-I
secondary Arg-I
language Arg-I
as Arg-I
early Arg-I
as Arg-I
kindergarten Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
children Arg-B
might Arg-I
not Arg-I
be Arg-I
really Arg-I
comfortable Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
language Arg-I
other Arg-I
than Arg-I
their Arg-I
native Arg-I
tongue Arg-I
when Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
kindergarten Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

Learning Arg-B
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
must Arg-I
be Arg-I
convenient Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
if Arg-I
they Arg-I
speak Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
way Arg-I
that Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
used Arg-I
to Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
teachers Arg-B
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
most Arg-I
likely Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
confusion Arg-I
for Arg-I
children Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
yet Arg-I
to Arg-I
start Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

Another O
important O
thing O
to O
consider O
is O
that O
the Arg-B
teacher Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
well Arg-I
- Arg-I
trained Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
specific Arg-I
language Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
quality Arg-I
education Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
delivered Arg-I
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
kids Arg-B
are Arg-I
amazing Arg-I
learners Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
time Arg-I
to Arg-I
hone Arg-I
them Arg-I
is Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
younger Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
introduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
new Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
; O
however O
, O
their Arg-B
curiosity Arg-I
will Arg-I
drive Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
and Arg-I
comprehend Arg-I
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
grasping Arg-B
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
language Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
natural Arg-I
to Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the Arg-B
positive Arg-I
impact Arg-I
of Arg-I
this Arg-I
strategy Arg-I
is Arg-I
beneficial Arg-I
to Arg-I
both Arg-I
learners Arg-I
and Arg-I
teachers Arg-I
. O

Teachers Arg-B
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
find Arg-I
it Arg-I
difficult Arg-I
to Arg-I
make Arg-I
students Arg-I
learn Arg-I
such Arg-I
new Arg-I
concept Arg-I
in Arg-I
their Arg-I
teenage Arg-I
years Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
certainly O
clear O
that O
the Arg-B
advantages Arg-I
of Arg-I
early Arg-I
introduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
foreign Arg-I
language Arg-I
outweigh Arg-I
its Arg-I
disadvantages Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
use O
of O
foreign O
language O
instruction O
as O
early O
as O
kindergarten O
is O
supported O
by O
some O
people O
; O
however O
, O
there O
are O
those O
who O
disagree O
. O

I O
am O
totally O
convinced O
that O
if Arg-B
this Arg-I
endeavour Arg-I
is Arg-I
properly Arg-I
implemented Arg-I
by Arg-I
schools Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
will Arg-I
most Arg-I
likely Arg-I
lead Arg-I
to Arg-I
improvement Arg-I
of Arg-I
learning Arg-I
ability Arg-I
among Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

International O
tourism O
leads O
to O
both O
- O
tension O
and O
understanding O

I O
agree O
with O
both O
opinions O
that O
international Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
causes Arg-I
tension Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
culture Arg-I
, O
because O
most Arg-B
people Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
after Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
conflict Arg-I
or Arg-I
debates Arg-I
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
some Arg-B
behaviors Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
are Arg-I
not Arg-I
welcome Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
area Arg-I
. O

Firstly O
, O
some Arg-B
people Arg-I
leave Arg-I
the Arg-I
rubbish Arg-I
after Arg-I
visiting Arg-I
the Arg-I
attractions Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
those Arg-B
local Arg-I
residents Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
clean Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
frequently Arg-I
so O
that O
the Arg-B
new Arg-I
batch Arg-I
of Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
will Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
tidy Arg-I
and Arg-I
neat Arg-I
environment Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
tourists Arg-B
may Arg-I
offend Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
people Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
different Arg-I
culture Arg-I
background Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
Indians Arg-B
do Arg-I
n't Arg-I
eat Arg-I
beef Arg-I
since O
they Arg-B
worship Arg-I
cows Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
if Arg-B
tourists Arg-I
want Arg-I
to Arg-I
respect Arg-I
the Arg-I
tradition Arg-I
, Arg-I
they Arg-I
will Arg-I
not Arg-I
order Arg-I
any Arg-I
beef Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
restaurant Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
in Arg-B
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
the Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
between Arg-I
foreigners Arg-I
and Arg-I
locals Arg-I
, Arg-I
people Arg-I
are Arg-I
trying Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
different Arg-I
culture Arg-I
and Arg-I
find Arg-I
solutions Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
tourists Arg-B
are Arg-I
given Arg-I
the Arg-I
brochures Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
local Arg-I
traditions Arg-I
and Arg-I
customs Arg-I
before Arg-I
they Arg-I
visit Arg-I
the Arg-I
place Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the Arg-B
tour Arg-I
guide Arg-I
are Arg-I
willing Arg-I
to Arg-I
help Arg-I
tourists Arg-I
to Arg-I
understand Arg-I
the Arg-I
culture Arg-I
from Arg-I
other Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
the Arg-B
possibility Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
is Arg-I
reduced Arg-I
because Arg-I
the Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
between Arg-I
both Arg-I
parties Arg-I
. O

Obviously O
, O
people Arg-B
are Arg-I
looking Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
solution Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
each Arg-I
other Arg-I
while Arg-I
they Arg-I
encounter Arg-I
the Arg-I
conflicts Arg-I
caused Arg-I
by Arg-I
international Arg-I
tourism Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
international Arg-B
tourism Arg-I
leads Arg-I
to Arg-I
both Arg-I
tension Arg-I
and Arg-I
understanding Arg-I
between Arg-I
people Arg-I
from Arg-I
different Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Traditional O
skills O
and O
ways O
are O
always O
valuable O
and O
will O
last O
forever O
These O
days O
, O
most O
of O
countries O
on O
the O
world O
invest O
for O
technology O
. O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
technology O
promotes O
economy O
. O

Many O
people O
think O
that O
conventional O
things O
will O
not O
exist O
and O
should O
be O
eliminated O
. O

I O
totally O
disagree O
this O
opinion O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
traditional Arg-B
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
belong Arg-I
to Arg-I
value Arg-I
of Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
make Arg-I
differences Arg-I
between Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

Every Arg-B
country Arg-I
has Arg-I
unique Arg-I
tradtions Arg-I
which Arg-I
show Arg-I
their Arg-I
creation Arg-I
, Arg-I
intelligence Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
people Arg-B
feel Arg-I
pround Arg-I
of Arg-I
their Arg-I
country Arg-I
, O
so O
they Arg-B
keep Arg-I
reserving Arg-I
conventions Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
ways Arg-B
to Arg-I
build Arg-I
a Arg-I
house Arg-I
in Arg-I
every Arg-I
country Arg-I
are Arg-I
different Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
distinguish Arg-I
between Arg-I
countries Arg-I
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in Arg-B
some Arg-I
cases Arg-I
that Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
way Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
replace Arg-I
by Arg-I
a Arg-I
new Arg-I
technology Arg-I
. O

Lot Arg-B
of Arg-I
people Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
things Arg-I
because Arg-I
if Arg-I
their Arg-I
quality Arg-I
and Arg-I
durability Arg-I
. O

In O
paticular O
, O
vases Arg-B
are Arg-I
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
hand Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
used Arg-I
more Arg-I
. O

Futhermore O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
plenty Arg-I
of Arg-I
works Arg-I
that Arg-I
using Arg-I
traditional Arg-I
way Arg-I
is Arg-I
unique Arg-I
method Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
making Arg-B
cone Arg-I
hats Arg-I
from Arg-I
leaves Arg-I
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
hand Arg-I
. O

Not Arg-B
only Arg-I
because Arg-I
there Arg-I
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
machine Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
work Arg-I
, Arg-I
but Arg-I
also Arg-I
it Arg-I
looks Arg-I
more Arg-I
beautiful Arg-I
when Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
made Arg-I
by Arg-I
hand Arg-I
, Arg-I
so Arg-I
resulting Arg-I
in Arg-I
greater Arg-I
value Arg-I
economy Arg-I
. O

The O
last O
thing O
is O
about O
education O
. O

Traditional Arg-B
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
will Arg-I
help Arg-I
youngsters Arg-I
study Arg-I
and Arg-I
know Arg-I
more Arg-I
history Arg-I
. O

Methods Arg-B
which Arg-I
their Arg-I
ancestors Arg-I
used Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
past Arg-I
will Arg-I
be Arg-I
displayed Arg-I
again Arg-I
for Arg-I
new Arg-I
generations Arg-I
. O

After O
that O
, O
they Arg-B
might Arg-I
create Arg-I
somethings Arg-I
that Arg-I
are Arg-I
useful Arg-I
for Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
technology Arg-B
has Arg-I
brought Arg-I
many Arg-I
benefits Arg-I
, O
but O
traditional Arg-B
skills Arg-I
and Arg-I
ways Arg-I
are Arg-I
always Arg-I
valuable Arg-I
and Arg-I
will Arg-I
last Arg-I
forever Arg-I

In O

this O

However O

argue O
that O
it O
is O
not O

to O
control O
violence O
in O
society O
by O
the O
death O

. O

Personally O
, O
I O
think O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
no Arg-I
evidence Arg-I
about Arg-I
the Arg-I
reduction Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rates Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
death Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
because O
of O
many O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
revenge Arg-I
which Arg-I
creates Arg-I
violent Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Crimes Arg-B
kill Arg-I
someone Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
illegal Arg-I
; Arg-I
nevertheless Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
government Arg-I
use Arg-I
law Arg-I
to Arg-I
punish Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
way Arg-I
they Arg-I
sinned Arg-I
but Arg-I
in Arg-I
a Arg-I
legal Arg-I
one Arg-I
. O

As O
a O
fact O
that O
the Arg-B
criminal Arg-I
is Arg-I
repeated Arg-I
second Arg-I
time Arg-I
; O
also O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
regarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
" Arg-I
legalized Arg-I
revenge Arg-I
" Arg-I
to Arg-I
victims Arg-I
' Arg-I
family Arg-I
. O

Hence O
, O
death Arg-B
penalty Arg-I
neither Arg-I
controls Arg-I
the Arg-I
violent Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
nor Arg-I
creates Arg-I
a Arg-I
violent Arg-I
culture Arg-I
. O

Secondly O
, O
nobody Arg-B
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
another Arg-I
human Arg-I
life Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the Arg-B
rights Arg-I
of Arg-I
life Arg-I
are Arg-I
the Arg-I
basic Arg-I
and Arg-I
vital Arg-I
rights Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
being Arg-I
. O

No Arg-B
one Arg-I
has Arg-I
the Arg-I
right Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
the Arg-I
life Arg-I
of Arg-I
a Arg-I
human Arg-I
; Arg-I
even Arg-I
if Arg-I
he Arg-I
committed Arg-I
murder Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
you Arg-I
kill Arg-I
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
, Arg-I
you Arg-I
become Arg-I
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
if Arg-B
we Arg-I
think Arg-I
that Arg-I
killing Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
best Arg-I
way Arg-I
to Arg-I
solve Arg-I
the Arg-I
problem Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
neither Arg-I
unethical Arg-I
nor Arg-I
immoral Arg-I
. O

In O
short O
, O
crimes Arg-B
seem Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
. O

Finally O
, O
with Arg-B
some Arg-I
of Arg-I
serious Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
, Arg-I
capital Arg-I
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
easy Arg-I
way Arg-I
out Arg-I
. O

Criminals Arg-B
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
punished Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
misdeeds Arg-I
. O

If Arg-B
they Arg-I
kill Arg-I
someone Arg-I
and Arg-I
end Arg-I
their Arg-I
life Arg-I
by Arg-I
dead Arg-I
without Arg-I
paying Arg-I
for Arg-I
their Arg-I
sins Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
so Arg-I
easy Arg-I
for Arg-I
them Arg-I
. O

They Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
undergo Arg-I
any Arg-I
pain Arg-I
or Arg-I
misery Arg-I
. O

Why O
do O
not O
we O
have O
other O
wisely O
punishments O
? O

As O
we O
can O
see O
some Arg-B
industries Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
mining Arg-I
, Arg-I
oil Arg-I
and Arg-I
gas Arg-I
extraction Arg-I
, Arg-I
reclamation Arg-I
, Arg-I
etc Arg-I
, Arg-I
needs Arg-I
many Arg-I
labors Arg-I
. O

Why Arg-B
do Arg-I
not Arg-I
punish Arg-I
them Arg-I
by Arg-I
doing Arg-I
something Arg-I
meaningful Arg-I
for Arg-I
the Arg-I
country- Arg-I

it Arg-I
is Arg-I
better Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
rehabilitation Arg-B
and Arg-I
education Arg-I
is Arg-I
also Arg-I
a Arg-I
better Arg-I
way Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
prevent Arg-I
or Arg-I
minimize Arg-I
offensive Arg-I
acts Arg-I
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
capital Arg-B
punishment Arg-I
is Arg-I
a Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
legalized Arg-I
revenge Arg-I
, Arg-I
it Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
easy Arg-I
way Arg-I
for Arg-I
serious Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
nobody Arg-I
has Arg-I
rights Arg-I
to Arg-I
take Arg-I
others Arg-I
life Arg-I
; O
thus O
, O
it Arg-B
neither Arg-I
demines Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
of Arg-I
violence Arg-I
nor Arg-I
be Arg-I
essential Arg-I
to Arg-I
control Arg-I
violence Arg-I
in Arg-I
society Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
world Arg-I
should Arg-I
consider Arg-I
clearly Arg-I
about Arg-I
polishing Arg-I
the Arg-I
law Arg-I
of Arg-I
the Arg-I
dead Arg-I
penalty Arg-I
. O

Technology O
helps O
student O
learn O
more O
information O
and O
learn O
more O
quickly O
? O

Nowadays O
, O
technology O
plays O
an O
indispensable O
role O
in O
almost O
all O
spheres O
of O
life O
. O

In O
education O
, O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
technology O
help O
the O
students O
improve O
their O
scholastic O
performances O
. O

From O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
the Arg-B
richness Arg-I
as Arg-I
well Arg-I
as Arg-I
convenience Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
are Arg-I
two Arg-I
main Arg-I
factors Arg-I
that Arg-I
contribute Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
progress Arg-I
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
since O
technology Arg-B
was Arg-I
introduced Arg-I
, Arg-I
student Arg-I
have Arg-I
been Arg-I
exposed Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
wide Arg-I
range Arg-I
of Arg-I
information Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
neccessarily Arg-I
broaden Arg-I
their Arg-I
minds Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
internet Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
example Arg-I
, Arg-I
provide Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
form Arg-I
of Arg-I
news Arg-I
, Arg-I
radio Arg-I
talks Arg-I
, Arg-I
tapes Arg-I
or Arg-I
reseachs Arg-I
on Arg-I
any Arg-I
particular Arg-I
fields Arg-I
. O

There Arg-B
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
students Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
only Arg-I
ascertain Arg-I
concerned Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
but Arg-I
they Arg-I
can Arg-I
also Arg-I
get Arg-I
access Arg-I
to Arg-I
relevant Arg-I
issues Arg-I
and Arg-I
discuss Arg-I
with Arg-I
people Arg-I
worldwide Arg-I
. O

Another Arg-B
point Arg-I
that Arg-I
students Arg-I
may Arg-I
benefit Arg-I
from Arg-I
technology Arg-I
is Arg-I
the Arg-I
shortened Arg-I
time Arg-I
for Arg-I
learning Arg-I
. O

The Arg-B
modern Arg-I
world Arg-I
provides Arg-I
learners Arg-I
with Arg-I
the Arg-I
mp3 Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
mobile Arg-I
phone Arg-I
or Arg-I
the Arg-I
laptop Arg-I
that Arg-I
help Arg-I
them Arg-I
, Arg-I
especially Arg-I
language Arg-I
learners Arg-I
, Arg-I
listen Arg-I
to Arg-I
recordings Arg-I
everywhre Arg-I
or Arg-I
read Arg-I
documents Arg-I
anytime Arg-I
. O

Therefore O
, O
students Arg-B
will Arg-I
develop Arg-I
their Arg-I
skills Arg-I
at Arg-I
a Arg-I
greater Arg-I
pace Arg-I
. O

Moreover O
, O
the Arg-B
internet Arg-I
again Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
an Arg-I
inexhaustible Arg-I
resource Arg-I
of Arg-I
visual Arg-I
aids Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
educational Arg-I
games Arg-I
, Arg-I
sounds Arg-I
or Arg-I
images Arg-I
with Arg-I
which Arg-I
students Arg-I
may Arg-I
absorb Arg-I
abstract Arg-I
concepts Arg-I
taught Arg-I
at Arg-I
school Arg-I
more Arg-I
briskly Arg-I
and Arg-I
thoroughly Arg-I
. O

On O
balance O
, O
I Arg-B
have Arg-I
to Arg-I
consent Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
use Arg-I
of Arg-I
technology Arg-I
in Arg-I

, O
as O
it Arg-B
expedites Arg-I
data Arg-I
availability Arg-I
and Arg-I
accelarates Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
learning Arg-I
process Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended O
that O
apart O
from O

, O
technology O
should O
be O
applied O
in O
every O
aspect O

which O

It O

that O

Their O

It O

argued O
that O

the O

mainly O
contribute O
to O
their O
accomplishments O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
the Arg-B

should Arg-I
be Arg-I
regarded Arg-I
as Arg-I
the Arg-I
most Arg-I
important Arg-I
influence Arg-I
on Arg-I
individual Arg-I
achievements Arg-I
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
the Arg-B

themselves Arg-I
creat Arg-I
a Arg-I
competitive Arg-I
atmoshphere Arg-I
which Arg-I
incent Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
. O

In Arg-B
high Arg-I
school Arg-I
, Arg-I
for Arg-I
instance Arg-I
, Arg-I
an Arg-I
individual Arg-I
can Arg-I
not Arg-I
resist Arg-I
studying Arg-I
painstakingly Arg-I
through Arg-I
day Arg-I
and Arg-I
night Arg-I
when Arg-I
the Arg-I
others Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
astoundingly Arg-I
ambitious Arg-I
and Arg-I
set Arg-I
sights Arg-I
on Arg-I
prestigious Arg-I
universities Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
globe Arg-I
are Arg-I
doing Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
. O

From Arg-B
a Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
perspective Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
feeling Arg-I
of Arg-I
being Arg-I
subordinate Arg-I
to Arg-I
their Arg-I
peers Arg-I
exert Arg-I
enormous Arg-I
pressure Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
subsequently Arg-I
transforms Arg-I
into Arg-I
some Arg-I
sort Arg-I
of Arg-I
stimulants Arg-I
and Arg-I
boosts Arg-I
the Arg-I
children Arg-I
's Arg-I
academic Arg-I
performances Arg-I
. O

To O
add O
up O
, O
when Arg-B
it Arg-I
comes Arg-I
to Arg-I
knowledge Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
acquisition Arg-I
of Arg-I
such Arg-I
, Arg-I
classmates Arg-I
are Arg-I
second Arg-I

none Arg-I

It O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
that O
students Arg-B
share Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I

a Arg-I
great Arg-I

of Arg-I
wisdom Arg-I
they Arg-I
absorb Arg-I
from Arg-I
each Arg-I

it Arg-B

lessons Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I

general Arg-I

sometimes Arg-I

Sharing Arg-B
the Arg-I

at Arg-I
their Arg-I
most Arg-I
comfort Arg-I

All O

by Arg-I
the Arg-I

they Arg-B
provide Arg-I
tremendous Arg-I

two Arg-I
crucial Arg-I
commodities Arg-I

Detailed O
description O
of O
crimes O
on O
newspaper O

can O
have O
bad O
consequences O
on O
society O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
print O
as O
well O
as O
the O
electronic O
media O
tend O
to O
dedicate O
large O
amounts O
of O
airtime O
and O
space O
to O
detailed O
reports O
about O

. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
such Arg-B
details Arg-I
should Arg-I
be Arg-I
strictly Arg-I
censored Arg-I
, Arg-I
if Arg-I
not Arg-I
banned Arg-I
altogether Arg-I
. O

It O
is O
widely O
known O
that O
the Arg-B
press Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
public Arg-I
with Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
content Arg-I
in Arg-I
order Arg-I
to Arg-I
increase Arg-I
newspaper Arg-I
circulation Arg-I
and Arg-I
TV Arg-I
rating Arg-I
. O

These Arg-B
days Arg-I
the Arg-I
primary Arg-I
purpose Arg-I
of Arg-I
journalists Arg-I
covering Arg-I
the Arg-I
details Arg-I
of Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
acts Arg-I
is Arg-I
, Arg-I
more Arg-I
often Arg-I
than Arg-I
that Arg-I
, Arg-I
to Arg-I
boost Arg-I
newspaper Arg-I
circulations Arg-I
and Arg-I
TV Arg-I
ratings Arg-I
. O

Consequently O
, O
a Arg-B
great Arg-I
deal Arg-I
of Arg-I
crime Arg-I
coverage Arg-I
is Arg-I
rather Arg-I
biased Arg-I
, Arg-I
exaggerated Arg-I
or Arg-I
fraudulent Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
only Arg-I
result Arg-I
to Arg-I
terrorize Arg-I
communities Arg-I
and Arg-I
leave Arg-I
law Arg-I
- Arg-I
aiding Arg-I
people Arg-I
increasingly Arg-I
apprehensive Arg-I
of Arg-I
about Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

An O
even O
more O
detrimental O
fact O
is O
that O
detailed Arg-B
reports Arg-I
of Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
exposured Arg-I
on Arg-I
the Arg-I
press Arg-I
may Arg-I
provide Arg-I
the Arg-I
potential Arg-I
criminals Arg-I
with Arg-I
instructive Arg-I
learning Arg-I
materials Arg-I
, Arg-I
which Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
hard Arg-I
to Arg-I
obtain Arg-I
otherwise Arg-I
. O

This Arg-B
may Arg-I
help Arg-I
those Arg-I
who Arg-I
are Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
process Arg-I
of Arg-I
panning Arg-I
a Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
act Arg-I
perfect Arg-I
their Arg-I

avoid Arg-I
the Arg-I

make Arg-I
themselves Arg-I
harder Arg-I
to Arg-I
be Arg-I
tracked Arg-I
down Arg-I
by Arg-I
the Arg-I
police Arg-I
. O

Thus O
, O
without Arg-B
the Arg-I
prevention Arg-I
on Arg-I
criminal Arg-I
details Arg-I
, Arg-I
the Arg-I
unlawful Arg-I
behavior Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
more Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
severe Arg-I
and Arg-I
the Arg-I
social Arg-I
harmony Arg-I
would Arg-I
be Arg-I
broken Arg-I
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
particular Arg-B
coverage Arg-I
of Arg-I
heinous Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
may Arg-I
further Arg-I
traumatize Arg-I
the Arg-I
victims Arg-I
of Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
because O
they Arg-B
have Arg-I
already Arg-I
suffered Arg-I
greatly Arg-I
for Arg-I
what Arg-I
they Arg-I
have Arg-I
experienced Arg-I
. O

Without Arg-B
their Arg-I
consent Arg-I
, Arg-I
this Arg-I
could Arg-I
only Arg-I
add Arg-I
to Arg-I
theses Arg-I
innocent Arg-I
people Arg-I
's Arg-I
mental Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
do Arg-I
some Arg-I
extreme Arg-I
actions Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
hold O
my O
point O
that O
any Arg-B
descriptions Arg-I
of Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
should Arg-I
not Arg-I
go Arg-I
unchecked Arg-I
as Arg-I
any Arg-I
longer Arg-I
, O
as Arg-B
they Arg-I
may Arg-I
be Arg-I
false Arg-I
, Arg-I
may Arg-I
further Arg-I
drive Arg-I
up Arg-I
the Arg-I
already Arg-I
- Arg-I
high Arg-I
crime Arg-I
rate Arg-I
and Arg-I
may Arg-I
bring Arg-I
even Arg-I
more Arg-I
suffering Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
victims Arg-I
of Arg-I
crimes Arg-I
. O

We O
can O
not O
forcedly O
put O
the O
same O
numbers O
of O
males O
and O
females O
into O
every O
subject O

There O
is O
a O
view O
that O
universities O
and O
colleges O
should O
equally O
enroll O
male O
and O
female O
students O
in O
numbers O
in O
each O
faculty O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
the O
viewpoint O
, O
because O
many Arg-B
different Arg-I
characters Arg-I
exist Arg-I
between Arg-I
male Arg-I
and Arg-I
female Arg-I
students Arg-I
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
boys Arg-B
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
have Arg-I
the Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
in Arg-I
psychological Arg-I
modes Arg-I
and Arg-I
individuality Arg-I
. O

Most Arg-B
of Arg-I
male Arg-I
students Arg-I
tend Arg-I
to Arg-I
use Arg-I
their Arg-I
left Arg-I
brain Arg-I
to Arg-I
think Arg-I
and Arg-I
act Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
rational Arg-I
and Arg-I
logical Arg-I
than Arg-I
girls Arg-I
in Arg-I
many Arg-I
cases Arg-I
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
male Arg-I
scientists Arg-I
and Arg-I
engineers Arg-I
in Arg-I
comparison Arg-I
with Arg-I
females Arg-I
around Arg-I
the Arg-I
world Arg-I
. O

Many Arg-B
boys Arg-I
are Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
science Arg-I
and Arg-I
technology Arg-I
, Arg-I
while Arg-I
a Arg-I
number Arg-I
of Arg-I
girls Arg-I
like Arg-I
to Arg-I
learn Arg-I
literature Arg-I
, Arg-I
education Arg-I
and Arg-I
arts Arg-I
. O

Besides O
, O
girls Arg-B
are Arg-I
more Arg-I
likely Arg-I
to Arg-I
prefer Arg-I
some Arg-I
jobs Arg-I
related Arg-I
to Arg-I
emotion Arg-I
and Arg-I
communication Arg-I
, Arg-I
such Arg-I
as Arg-I
teacher Arg-I
, Arg-I
singer Arg-I
and Arg-I
interpreter Arg-I
. O

This O
means O
that O
girls Arg-B
differ Arg-I
from Arg-I
boys Arg-I
in Arg-I
mind Arg-I
and Arg-I
behaviour Arg-I
to Arg-I
a Arg-I
large Arg-I
extent Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
they Arg-I
both Arg-I
have Arg-I
better Arg-I
ability Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
specific Arg-I
aspect Arg-I
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it Arg-B
can Arg-I
have Arg-I
a Arg-I
negative Arg-I
affect Arg-I
on Arg-I
these Arg-I
students Arg-I
to Arg-I
require Arg-I
them Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
a Arg-I
subject Arg-I
in Arg-I
equal Arg-I
proportion Arg-I
of Arg-I
gender Arg-I
, O
and O
that Arg-B
does Arg-I
not Arg-I
conform Arg-I
to Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
personality Arg-I
traits Arg-I
and Arg-I
mental Arg-I
development Arg-I
. O

For O
example O
, O
a Arg-B
girl Arg-I
, Arg-I
who Arg-I
is Arg-I
interested Arg-I
in Arg-I
literature Arg-I
, Arg-I
is Arg-I
arranged Arg-I
into Arg-I
an Arg-I
engineering Arg-I
department Arg-I
, O
but O
she Arg-B
is Arg-I
unlikely Arg-I
to Arg-I
focus Arg-I
on Arg-I
her Arg-I
subject Arg-I
, O
and O
this Arg-B
also Arg-I
can Arg-I
block Arg-I
the Arg-I
girl Arg-I
's Arg-I
future Arg-I
development Arg-I
and Arg-I
career Arg-I
prospect Arg-I
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
universities Arg-B
should Arg-I
encourage Arg-I
more Arg-I
girls Arg-I
to Arg-I
choose Arg-I
science Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
and Arg-I
more Arg-I
boys Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
the Arg-I
humanities Arg-I
, O
and O
this Arg-B
could Arg-I
avoid Arg-I
imbalance Arg-I
of Arg-I
gender Arg-I
in Arg-I
some Arg-I
subjects Arg-I
. O

It Arg-B
would Arg-I
affect Arg-I
students Arg-I
' Arg-I
mental Arg-I
health Arg-I
to Arg-I
study Arg-I
in Arg-I
the Arg-I
environment Arg-I
of Arg-I
single Arg-I
gender Arg-I
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
it Arg-B
is Arg-I
necessary Arg-I
for Arg-I
universities Arg-I
to Arg-I
respect Arg-I
the Arg-I
individual Arg-I
choice Arg-I
of Arg-I
subject Arg-I
due Arg-I
to Arg-I
the Arg-I
diversity Arg-I
of Arg-I
boys Arg-I
and Arg-I
girls Arg-I
, Arg-I
and Arg-I
we Arg-I
ca Arg-I
not Arg-I
forcedly Arg-I
put Arg-I
the Arg-I
same Arg-I
numbers Arg-I
of Arg-I
males Arg-I
and Arg-I
females Arg-I
into Arg-I
every Arg-I
subject Arg-I
