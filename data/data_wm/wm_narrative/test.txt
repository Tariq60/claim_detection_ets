Overcoming O-claim
my O-claim
struggle O-claim
with O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
idea O-claim
that O-claim
being O-claim
diagnosed O-claim
with O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
affect O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
so O-claim
drastically O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
remember O-claim
the O-claim
day O-claim
my O-claim
doctor O-claim
told O-claim
us O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
learning O-claim
disability O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
first O-claim
found O-claim
out O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
think O-claim
much O-claim
of O-claim
It O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
bother O-claim
me O-claim
or O-claim
affect O-claim
me O-claim
at O-claim
all O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
I O-claim
advanced O-claim
into O-claim
higher O-claim
grades O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
understand O-claim
what O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
dealing O-claim
with O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
became O-claim
harder O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
keep O-claim
up O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
struggle O-claim
with O-claim
writing O-claim
, O-claim
reading O-claim
and O-claim
spelling O-claim
. O-claim

Being O-claim
diagnosed O-claim
with O-claim
Dyslexia B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
a I-claim
challenge I-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
can O-claim
be O-claim
overcome O-claim
. O-claim

Finding O-claim
out O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
different O-claim
and O-claim
learning O-claim
what O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
was O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
struggled O-claim
with O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
difficult O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
always O-claim
thought O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
everyone O-claim
else O-claim
. O-claim

Life O-claim
was O-claim
pretty O-claim
normal O-claim
in O-claim
kindergarten O-claim
through O-claim
second O-claim
grade O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
friends O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
class O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
all O-claim
still O-claim
learning O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
and O-claim
write O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
feel O-claim
behind O-claim
, O-claim
slow O-claim
or O-claim
confused O-claim
about O-claim
the O-claim
work O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
doing O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
class O-claim
as O-claim
my O-claim
friends O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
whole O-claim
day O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
did O-claim
every O-claim
activity O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim
smart O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
excited O-claim
to O-claim
learn O-claim
. O-claim

Towards O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
of O-claim
second O-claim
grade O-claim
I O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
fall O-claim
behind O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
idea O-claim
why O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
suddenly O-claim
slipping O-claim
behind O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
class O-claim
work O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
confidence O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
disappear O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
eagerness O-claim
to O-claim
learn O-claim
went O-claim
with O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
finally O-claim
happened O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
notice O-claim
the O-claim
changes O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
homework O-claim
and O-claim
ability O-claim
to O-claim
keep O-claim
up O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
scheduled O-claim
a O-claim
doctor O-claim
's O-claim
appointment O-claim
with O-claim
Doctor O-claim
Spens O-claim
. O-claim

Doctor O-claim
Spens O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
tall O-claim
friendly O-claim
man O-claim
in O-claim
his O-claim
late O-claim
thirties O-claim
with O-claim
light O-claim
gray O-claim
hair O-claim
and O-claim
glasses O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim
safe O-claim
and O-claim
comfortable O-claim
around O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
those O-claim
people O-claim
who O-claim
gave O-claim
off O-claim
a O-claim
warm O-claim
welcoming O-claim
feeling O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
mom O-claim
explained O-claim
to O-claim
Doctor O-claim
Spens O-claim
what O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
noticing O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
told O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
what O-claim
he O-claim
thought O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
through O-claim
and O-claim
gave O-claim
her O-claim
some O-claim
papers O-claim
that O-claim
explains O-claim
it O-claim
better O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
night O-claim
she O-claim
explained O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
what O-claim
he O-claim
had O-claim
told O-claim
her O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
little O-claim
about O-claim
what O-claim
she O-claim
read O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
type O-claim
of O-claim
learning O-claim
disability O-claim
called O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
. O-claim

About O-claim
a O-claim
year O-claim
after O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
seen O-claim
Doctor O-claim
Spens O-claim
and O-claim
learned O-claim
about O-claim
my O-claim
learning O-claim
disability O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
put O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
special O-claim
reading O-claim
and O-claim
spelling O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
now O-claim
in O-claim
third O-claim
grade O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
doing O-claim
better O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
work O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
keeping O-claim
up O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
class O-claim
was O-claim
easier O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
was O-claim
until O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
anyway O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
mostly O-claim
excited O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
sixth O-claim
grade O-claim
year O-claim
of O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

On O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
day O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
small O-claim
group O-claim
of O-claim
friends O-claim
compared O-claim
schedules O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
how O-claim
many O-claim
classes O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
confident O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
skills O-claim
to O-claim
find O-claim
my O-claim
classes O-claim
and O-claim
get O-claim
to O-claim
them O-claim
in O-claim
time O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
first O-claim
few O-claim
weeks O-claim
went O-claim
by O-claim
quickly O-claim
and O-claim
smoothly O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
it O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
happen O-claim
again O-claim
my O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
cause O-claim
me O-claim
problems O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
began O-claim
in O-claim
sixth O-claim
grade O-claim
Language O-claim
and O-claim
Literature O-claim
and O-claim
grew O-claim
into O-claim
having O-claim
trouble O-claim
with O-claim
finishing O-claim
a O-claim
book O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
certain O-claim
due O-claim
date O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
reading O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
struggles O-claim
only O-claim
became O-claim
worse O-claim
from O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
remember O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
time O-claim
a O-claim
teacher O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
spelling O-claim
counted O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
test O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
World O-claim
Geography O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
were O-claim
learning O-claim
about O-claim
the O-claim
oceans O-claim
around O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
knew O-claim
where O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
oceans O-claim
where O-claim
located O-claim
and O-claim
their O-claim
names O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
teacher O-claim
Mrs. O-claim
LaLone O-claim
, O-claim
a O-claim
spunky O-claim
but O-claim
sturn O-claim
, O-claim
black O-claim
haired O-claim
lady O-claim
, O-claim
told O-claim
us O-claim
spelling O-claim
counted O-claim
toward O-claim
our O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
that O-claim
moment O-claim
my O-claim
heart O-claim
dropped O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
the O-claim
color O-claim
slowly O-claim
drain O-claim
from O-claim
my O-claim
face O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
stomach O-claim
filled O-claim
with O-claim
butterflies O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
's O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim
.. O-claim

my O-claim
A O-claim
in O-claim
this O-claim
class O-claim
was O-claim
over O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
all O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
struggled O-claim
with O-claim
spelling O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
night O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
home O-claim
and O-claim
cried O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
worried O-claim
about O-claim
the O-claim
spelling O-claim
on O-claim
this O-claim
test O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
affect O-claim
my O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
studied O-claim
for O-claim
hours O-claim
that O-claim
night O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
wrote O-claim
the O-claim
words O-claim
down O-claim
repeatedly O-claim
over O-claim
and O-claim
over O-claim
again O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim
better O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
more O-claim
prepared O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
next O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
walked O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
fourth O-claim
hour O-claim
class O-claim
ready O-claim
, O-claim
confident O-claim
and O-claim
only O-claim
a O-claim
little O-claim
nervous O-claim
. O-claim

Mrs. O-claim
Lalone O-claim
handed O-claim
us O-claim
our O-claim
papers O-claim
and O-claim
told O-claim
us O-claim
we O-claim
could O-claim
begin O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
rapidly O-claim
began O-claim
filling O-claim
out O-claim
the O-claim
test O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
as O-claim
soon O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
part O-claim
where O-claim
it O-claim
said O-claim
spelling O-claim
counts O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
shut O-claim
down O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
remember O-claim
anything O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
practiced O-claim
last O-claim
night O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
cry O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
confidence O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
left O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
replaced O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
fear O-claim
of O-claim
a O-claim
bad O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
only O-claim
became O-claim
worse O-claim
from O-claim
there O-claim
my O-claim
grades O-claim
decreased O-claim
in O-claim
almost O-claim
all O-claim
my O-claim
classes O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
everything O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
still O-claim
took O-claim
bad O-claim
scores O-claim
on O-claim
tests O-claim
all O-claim
because O-claim
of O-claim
spelling O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
beginning O-claim
of O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
I O-claim
learned O-claim
ways O-claim
to O-claim
cope O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
problems O-claim
and O-claim
they O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim
less O-claim
and O-claim
less O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
my O-claim
struggles O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
go O-claim
away O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
mom O-claim
helped O-claim
me O-claim
with O-claim
homework O-claim
at O-claim
home O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
look O-claim
up O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
spell O-claim
words O-claim
while O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
writing O-claim
papers O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
kinda O-claim
lowered O-claim
my O-claim
self O-claim
esteem O-claim
and O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
good O-claim
enough O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
live O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
eighth O-claim
grade O-claim
standards O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
also O-claim
had O-claim
friends O-claim
to O-claim
look O-claim
to O-claim
for O-claim
spelling O-claim
help O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
classes O-claim
. O-claim

Basically O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
majority O-claim
of O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
autocorrect O-claim
was O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
saver O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
this O-claim
pink O-claim
see O-claim
through O-claim
slip O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
used O-claim
for O-claim
reading O-claim
at O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
helped O-claim
me O-claim
focus O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
words O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
mom O-claim
just O-claim
had O-claim
my O-claim
little O-claim
sister O-claim
Lena O-claim
tested O-claim
for O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
because O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
having O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
struggles O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
through O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
diagnosed O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
also O-claim
has O-claim
ADHD O-claim
. O-claim

Having O-claim
found O-claim
out O-claim
about O-claim
her O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
young O-claim
age O-claim
her B-claim
teachers I-claim
are I-claim
able I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
her I-claim
a I-claim
little I-claim
more I-claim
than I-claim
they I-claim
could I-claim
for I-claim
me I-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
math O-claim
comes O-claim
easy O-claim
which O-claim
is O-claim
something O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
m O-claim
not O-claim
great O-claim
at O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
she O-claim
ca O-claim
n't O-claim
do O-claim
her O-claim
math O-claim
sometimes O-claim
because O-claim
she O-claim
can O-claim
not O-claim
read O-claim
the O-claim
problems O-claim
enough O-claim
to O-claim
understand O-claim
what O-claim
they O-claim
want O-claim
her O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
helping O-claim
her O-claim
at O-claim
home O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
she O-claim
is O-claim
going O-claim
through O-claim
. O-claim

Helping O-claim
her O-claim
has O-claim
actually O-claim
been O-claim
helping O-claim
me O-claim
as O-claim
well O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
not O-claim
completely O-claim
overcome O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
I O-claim
know O-claim
now O-claim
that O-claim
there O-claim
are O-claim
people O-claim
that O-claim
are O-claim
there O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
can O-claim
be O-claim
done O-claim
. O-claim

Going O-claim
through O-claim
Dyslexia O-claim
has O-claim
changed O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
completely O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
of O-claim
school O-claim
, O-claim
learning O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
other O-claim
daily O-claim
activities O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
feel O-claim
as O-claim
though O-claim
i O-claim
have O-claim
become O-claim
stronger O-claim
through O-claim
my O-claim
struggles O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
grown O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
person O-claim
while O-claim
struggling O-claim
and O-claim
fighting O-claim
for O-claim
what O-claim
comes O-claim
easy O-claim
to O-claim
others O-claim
. O-claim

If O-claim
i B-claim
had I-claim
never I-claim
been I-claim
diagnosed I-claim
with I-claim
Dyslexia I-claim
I I-claim
might I-claim
not I-claim
be I-claim
as I-claim
comfortable I-claim
with I-claim
myself I-claim
I I-claim
would I-claim
still I-claim
feel I-claim
behind I-claim
and I-claim
lost I-claim
. O-claim

If O-claim
my B-claim
parents I-claim
had I-claim
not I-claim
been I-claim
concerned I-claim
and I-claim
want I-claim
to I-claim
help I-claim
me I-claim
I I-claim
probably I-claim
would I-claim
have I-claim
never I-claim
gotten I-claim
the I-claim
help I-claim
I I-claim
needed I-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
still O-claim
feel O-claim
Insecure O-claim
about O-claim
my O-claim
abilities O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
and O-claim
write O-claim
sometimes O-claim
but O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
part O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
confident O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
approve O-claim
m O-claim
Insecure O-claim
about O-claim
my O-claim
abilities O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
and O-claim
right O-claim
sometimes O-claim
but O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
part O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
confident O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
improvement O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
my O-claim
struggles O-claim
have O-claim
not O-claim
gone O-claim
away O-claim
but O-claim
they O-claim
have O-claim
gotten O-claim
much O-claim
better O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
will O-claim
continue O-claim
to O-claim
work O-claim
on O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

Overall O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
had O-claim
my O-claim
up O-claim
and O-claim
downs O-claim
in O-claim
learning O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
know O-claim
now O-claim
if O-claim
I B-claim
keep I-claim
working I-claim
and I-claim
striving I-claim
to I-claim
get I-claim
better I-claim
one I-claim
day I-claim
I I-claim

with I-claim
Dyslexia I-claim

Losing B-claim

I O-claim

hear O-claim
that O-claim

like O-claim
a O-claim
short O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
walked O-claim
through O-claim
the O-claim
door O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
beginning O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
6th O-claim
grade O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
an O-claim
overwhelming O-claim
feeling O-claim
of O-claim
possibility O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
or O-claim
two O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
getting O-claim
used O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
whole O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
thing O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
getting O-claim
my O-claim
homework O-claim
done O-claim
and O-claim
on O-claim
time O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
also O-claim
pleasantly O-claim
surprised O-claim
by O-claim
my O-claim
grades O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
doing O-claim
good O-claim
and O-claim
school O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
easier O-claim
than O-claim
I O-claim
thought O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
amazed O-claim
by O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
different O-claim
It O-claim
was O-claim
than O-claim
elementary O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

There O-claim
was O-claim
more O-claim
homework O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
It O-claim
was O-claim
just O-claim
stuff O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
not O-claim
finished O-claim
Is O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
second O-claim
semester O-claim
my O-claim
grades O-claim
dropped O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
other O-claim
than O-claim
that O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
consistent O-claim
. O-claim

By O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
year O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
pretty O-claim
good O-claim
about O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
excited O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
7th O-claim
grade O-claim
year O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
Idea O-claim
what O-claim
was O-claim
In O-claim
store O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
6th O-claim
grade O-claim
everything O-claim
changed O-claim
the O-claim
thing O-claim
got O-claim
harder O-claim
and O-claim
more O-claim
complicated O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
fall O-claim
behind O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
got O-claim
lazy O-claim
and O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
slack O-claim
In O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
of O-claim
this O-claim
laziness O-claim
I O-claim
found O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
grades O-claim
dropped O-claim
dramatically O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grade O-claim
point O-claim
average O-claim
dropped O-claim
from O-claim
a O-claim
3.7 O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
2.9 O-claim
In O-claim
a O-claim
matter O-claim
of O-claim
days O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
life O-claim
was O-claim
horrible O-claim
at O-claim
home O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
saw O-claim
what O-claim
happened O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
take O-claim
away O-claim
my O-claim
privileges O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
snap O-claim
of O-claim
a O-claim
finger O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
worst O-claim
thing O-claim
was O-claim
he O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
fly O-claim
this O-claim
summer O-claim
until O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
was O-claim
my O-claim
Incentive O-claim
to O-claim
try O-claim
harder O-claim
than O-claim
I O-claim
ever O-claim
had O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
spent O-claim
hours O-claim
on O-claim
homework O-claim
after O-claim
school O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
It O-claim
done O-claim
and O-claim
done O-claim
right O-claim
. O-claim

Finally O-claim
It O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
semester O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
point O-claim
away O-claim
from O-claim
a O-claim
3.7 O-claim
grade O-claim
point O-claim
average O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
said O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
proud O-claim
of O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
count O-claim
my O-claim
worst O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
added O-claim
up O-claim
my O-claim
grade O-claim
point O-claim
average O-claim
without O-claim
that O-claim
grade O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
made O-claim
It O-claim
! O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
grade O-claim
point O-claim
average O-claim
of O-claim
3.7 O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
week O-claim
later O-claim
after O-claim
school O-claim
was O-claim
over O-claim
my O-claim
final O-claim
grades O-claim
went O-claim
In O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
3.7 O-claim
without O-claim
the O-claim
deleted O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
overjoyed O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
saw O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
grades O-claim
had O-claim
Improved O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
so O-claim
accomplished O-claim
and O-claim
motivated O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
well O-claim
next O-claim
year O-claim
. O-claim

Turns O-claim
out O-claim
all O-claim
I O-claim
needed O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
good O-claim
Incentive O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
right O-claim
mindset O-claim
to O-claim
succeed O-claim
. O-claim

Overcoming O-claim
my O-claim
low O-claim
grades O-claim
was O-claim
hard O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
perseverance O-claim
and O-claim
good O-claim
coaching O-claim
from O-claim
parents O-claim
and O-claim
teachers O-claim
Is O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
needed O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
Have O-claim
I O-claim
Overcome O-claim
? O-claim

Love O-claim
yourself O-claim
first O-claim
and O-claim
everything O-claim
else O-claim
falls O-claim
into O-claim
line O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
little O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim

every O-claim
other O-claim
girl O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
care O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
looked O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
sure O-claim
of O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

you O-claim
are O-claim
a O-claim
child O-claim
you B-claim
do I-claim
not I-claim
care I-claim
about I-claim
how I-claim
you I-claim
look I-claim
and I-claim
what I-claim
others I-claim
think I-claim
. O-claim

busy O-claim
being O-claim
a O-claim
kid O-claim
and O-claim
having O-claim
fun O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
you O-claim
have O-claim
confidence O-claim
your B-claim
whole I-claim
life I-claim
can I-claim
improve I-claim
and O-claim
you B-claim
can I-claim
let I-claim
go I-claim
self I-claim
doubt I-claim
and I-claim
stress I-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
when O-claim
you O-claim
lack O-claim
it O-claim
things O-claim
can O-claim
be O-claim

My O-claim
lack O-claim
of O-claim
confidence O-claim
has O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
learned O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
younger O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
wear O-claim
clothes O-claim
and O-claim
still O-claim
feel O-claim
comfortable O-claim
. O-claim

thought O-claim
that O-claim
people O-claim
would O-claim
judge O-claim
or O-claim
care O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
wore O-claim
or O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
looked O-claim
. O-claim

Halloweens O-claim
ago O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
nine O-claim
or O-claim
ten O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
choose O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
a O-claim
Monkey O-claim
or O-claim
a O-claim

Crayon O-claim
so O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
decided O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
combine O-claim
the O-claim
costumes O-claim
. O-claim

was O-claim
a O-claim
cute O-claim
purple O-claim
Monkey O-claim
Crayon O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
so O-claim
proud O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
outfit O-claim
and O-claim
myself O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
thankful O-claim
my O-claim

While O-claim
we O-claim
trick O-claim
or O-claim
treated O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
strutting O-claim
down O-claim
the O-claim
the O-claim
neighborhoods O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
if O-claim
that O-claim
were O-claim
now O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
panicking O-claim
because O-claim
i O-claim
want O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
presentable O-claim
. O-claim

clothes O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
child O-claim
my O-claim
number O-claim
one O-claim
priority O-claim
was O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
fashionable O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
elementary O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
stage O-claim
where O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
care O-claim
what O-claim
people O-claim
thought O-claim
and O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
it O-claim

would O-claim
be O-claim
a O-claim
problem O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
got O-claim
older O-claim
and O-claim
moved O-claim
to O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
I O-claim
realized O-claim
that O-claim
people B-claim
will I-claim
judge I-claim
things I-claim
you I-claim
do I-claim
and I-claim
how I-claim
you I-claim
do I-claim
it I-claim
, O-claim
that O-claim
slowly O-claim
got O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
slowly O-claim
plucking O-claim
petals O-claim

from O-claim
a O-claim
flower O-claim
, O-claim
everyday O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
something O-claim
different O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
personality O-claim
was O-claim
forced O-claim
to O-claim
change O-claim
, O-claim

I O-claim
realized O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
express O-claim
myself O-claim
as O-claim
easily O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
as O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
elementary O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
dress O-claim
different O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
wear O-claim
clothes O-claim
that O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
fit O-claim
me O-claim
completely O-claim
and O-claim
stayed O-claim
away O-claim

from O-claim
people O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
trust O-claim
or O-claim
I O-claim
thought O-claim
would O-claim
judge O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Imagine O-claim
coming O-claim
to O-claim
school O-claim
everyday O-claim
just O-claim
to O-claim
laugh O-claim
at O-claim
your O-claim
own O-claim
failure O-claim
and O-claim
embarrassment O-claim
; O-claim
this O-claim
used O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
my O-claim
situation O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
put O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
fake O-claim
smile O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
hide O-claim
the O-claim
fact O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
curl O-claim
up O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
ball O-claim
and O-claim
cry O-claim
. O-claim

Middle O-claim
school O-claim
for O-claim
anyone O-claim
is O-claim
rough O-claim
, O-claim
at O-claim
this O-claim
age O-claim
teenagers O-claim
start O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
rude O-claim
to O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
for O-claim
no O-claim
reason O-claim
. O-claim

Unfortunately O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
caught O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
crossfires O-claim
of O-claim
everyones O-claim
anguish O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
group O-claim
of O-claim
five O-claim
girls O-claim
used O-claim
me O-claim
as O-claim
their O-claim
verbal O-claim
punching O-claim
bag O-claim
. O-claim

All O-claim
across O-claim
the O-claim
nation O-claim
, O-claim
bullying O-claim
is O-claim
an O-claim
epidemic O-claim
that O-claim
students O-claim
battle O-claim
everyday O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
most O-claim
people O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
understand O-claim
is O-claim
that O-claim
if O-claim
bullying B-claim
continues I-claim
on I-claim
for I-claim
a I-claim
long I-claim
stretch I-claim
of I-claim
time I-claim
, I-claim
the I-claim
victim I-claim
will I-claim
most I-claim
likely I-claim
develop I-claim
symptoms I-claim
of I-claim
depression I-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

Bullying O-claim
and O-claim
depression O-claim
is O-claim
a O-claim
large O-claim
part O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
try O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
and O-claim
forget O-claim
every O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
bullying O-claim
started O-claim
in O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
lunch O-claim
table O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
classroom O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
playground O-claim
. O-claim

Timid O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
followed O-claim
my O-claim
only O-claim
friend O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
table O-claim
she O-claim
sat O-claim
at O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
never O-claim
really O-claim
talked O-claim
to O-claim
these O-claim
people O-claim
but O-claim
they O-claim
seemed O-claim
nice O-claim
. O-claim
.. O-claim

most O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
time O-claim
. O-claim

Laughter O-claim
, O-claim
music O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
noises O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
kitchen O-claim
filled O-claim
the O-claim
air O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
smell O-claim
of O-claim
body O-claim
odor O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
students O-claim
and O-claim
chicken O-claim
entered O-claim
my O-claim
nose O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
look O-claim
around O-claim
at O-claim
girls O-claim
that O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
care O-claim
much O-claim
about O-claim
their O-claim
looks O-claim
, O-claim
with O-claim
mismatched O-claim
clothes O-claim
and O-claim
unbrushed O-claim
hair O-claim
. O-claim

Her O-claim
friends O-claim
would O-claim
occasionally O-claim
say O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
You O-claim
're O-claim
trash O-claim
, O-claim
' O-claim
or O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
You O-claim
have O-claim
no O-claim
friends O-claim
. O-claim
' O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
let O-claim
this O-claim
bother O-claim
me O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
raised O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
strong O-claim
. O-claim

Little O-claim
did O-claim
I O-claim
know O-claim
, O-claim
this O-claim
was O-claim
just O-claim
the O-claim
calm O-claim
before O-claim
the O-claim
storm O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
the O-claim
year O-claim
progressed O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
become O-claim
worse O-claim
, O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
tease O-claim
me O-claim
about O-claim
being O-claim
a O-claim
closeted O-claim
lesbian O-claim
, O-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
heterosexual O-claim
. O-claim

No O-claim
matter O-claim
how O-claim
many O-claim
times O-claim
I O-claim
told O-claim
them O-claim
to O-claim
stop O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
insist O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
only O-claim
a O-claim
joke O-claim
, O-claim
so O-claim
they O-claim
continued O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
most O-claim
people O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
understand O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
fact O-claim
that O-claim
jokes O-claim
can O-claim
turn O-claim
into O-claim
a O-claim
world O-claim
of O-claim
internal O-claim
pain O-claim
and O-claim
hate O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
became O-claim
to O-claim
feel O-claim
afraid O-claim
of O-claim
speaking O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
judged O-claim
and O-claim
be O-claim
deemed O-claim
the O-claim
laughingstock O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
group O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
scared O-claim
, O-claim
intimidated O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
unappreciated O-claim
for O-claim
acting O-claim
like O-claim
their O-claim
friends O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
like O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
handle O-claim
their O-claim
words O-claim
until O-claim
they O-claim
said O-claim
three O-claim
words O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
that O-claim
would O-claim
change O-claim
everything O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
go O-claim
kill O-claim
yourself O-claim
' O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
took O-claim
their O-claim
words O-claim
with O-claim
a O-claim
grain O-claim
of O-claim
salt O-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
should O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
heard O-claim
those O-claim
words O-claim
everyday O-claim
, O-claim
they O-claim
seemed O-claim
to O-claim
erode O-claim
my O-claim
confidence O-claim
and O-claim
self O-claim
- O-claim
assurance O-claim
and O-claim
awareness O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
said O-claim
it O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
believe O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

` O-claim
Would O-claim
anyone O-claim
care O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
gone O-claim
? O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
That O-claim
would O-claim
really O-claim
show O-claim
them O-claim
all O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
gone O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
If O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
gone O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
doing O-claim
them O-claim
a O-claim
favor O-claim
because O-claim
they O-claim
hate O-claim
me O-claim
? O-claim
' O-claim

Those O-claim
thoughts O-claim
fluttered O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
constantly O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
attempted O-claim
anything O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
over O-claim
soon O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
never O-claim
put O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
through O-claim
that O-claim
pain O-claim
. O-claim

All O-claim
while O-claim
this O-claim
catastrophe O-claim
was O-claim
continuing O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
friend O-claim
, O-claim
who O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
ve O-claim
known O-claim
since O-claim
Kindergarten O-claim
just O-claim
sat O-claim
there O-claim
and O-claim
laughed O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
believe O-claim
in O-claim
sticking O-claim
up O-claim
for O-claim
your O-claim
friends O-claim
if O-claim
one O-claim
would O-claim
want O-claim
to O-claim
keep O-claim
them O-claim
, O-claim
clearly O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
acted O-claim
like O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
fine O-claim
that O-claim
her O-claim
best O-claim
friend O-claim
was O-claim
constantly O-claim
being O-claim
bullied O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
rotted O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
core O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
hid O-claim
beneath O-claim
a O-claim
smile O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
cry O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
might O-claim
ask O-claim
why O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
leave O-claim
the O-claim
group O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
other O-claim
friends O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
want O-claim
everyone O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
me O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
girl O-claim
with O-claim
no O-claim
friends O-claim
, O-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
. O-claim

Based O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
way O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
treated O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
assumed O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
everyone O-claim
's O-claim
burden O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
alone O-claim
. O-claim

These O-claim
feelings O-claim
spiraled O-claim
into O-claim
what O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
depression O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
lived O-claim
in O-claim
constant O-claim
fear O-claim
, O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
spoke O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
an O-claim
adult O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
get O-claim
them O-claim
in O-claim
trouble O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
seen O-claim
as O-claim
lame O-claim
and O-claim
weak O-claim
. O-claim

Instead O-claim
of O-claim
speaking O-claim
up O-claim
for O-claim
myself O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
kept O-claim
quiet O-claim
, O-claim
allowing O-claim
my O-claim
feelings O-claim
to O-claim
rot O-claim
inside O-claim
of O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
believe O-claim
I O-claim
reacted O-claim
in O-claim
this O-claim
way O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
frightened O-claim
into O-claim
silence O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
not O-claim
only O-claim
affected O-claim
my O-claim
personal O-claim
life O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
greatly O-claim
changed O-claim
my O-claim
home O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
quiet O-claim
and O-claim
gloomy O-claim
now O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
first O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
figured O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
tired O-claim
or O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
couple O-claim
rough O-claim
days O-claim
at O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
the O-claim
symptoms O-claim
continued O-claim
for O-claim
weeks O-claim
on O-claim
weeks O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
parent O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
constantly O-claim
worry O-claim
. O-claim

If O-claim
they O-claim
confronted O-claim
me O-claim
about O-claim
it O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
put O-claim
up O-claim
walls O-claim
and O-claim
get O-claim
defensive O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
keep O-claim
quiet O-claim
about O-claim
my O-claim
situation O-claim
as O-claim
best O-claim
as O-claim
possible O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
about O-claim
a O-claim
month O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
thought O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
anxiety O-claim
and O-claim
depression O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
denied O-claim
it O-claim
as O-claim
much O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
constantly O-claim
insisted O-claim
on O-claim
taking O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
professional O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
diagnosis O-claim
and O-claim
treatment O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
refused O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
presumed O-claim
it O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
a O-claim
phase O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
get O-claim
over O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
reacted O-claim
in O-claim
this O-claim
way O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
want O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
a O-claim
mountain O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
a O-claim
molehill O-claim
, O-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
already O-claim
towering O-claim
in O-claim
elevation O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
this O-claim
point O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
handling O-claim
this O-claim
all O-claim
by O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
kept O-claim
everything O-claim
to O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

Sooner O-claim
or O-claim
later O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
more O-claim
alone O-claim
than O-claim
I O-claim
ever O-claim
have O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
assumed O-claim
no O-claim
one O-claim
understood O-claim
me O-claim
as O-claim
well O-claim
, O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
completely O-claim
my O-claim
fault O-claim
and O-claim
true O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wish O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
expressed O-claim
my O-claim
feelings O-claim
instead O-claim
of O-claim
allowing O-claim
it O-claim
to O-claim
bubble O-claim
up O-claim
inside O-claim
of O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

About O-claim
every O-claim
two O-claim
weeks O-claim
my O-claim
mood O-claim
and O-claim
situation O-claim
would O-claim
explode O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
burst O-claim
into O-claim
tears O-claim
, O-claim
feeling O-claim
worthless O-claim
again O-claim
. O-claim

Around O-claim
the O-claim
holiday O-claim
season O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
fed O-claim
up O-claim
and O-claim
tired O-claim
of O-claim
hiding O-claim
my O-claim
school O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
confessed O-claim
everything O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
decided O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
best O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
leave O-claim
the O-claim
group O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
morning O-claim
in O-claim
February O-claim
, O-claim
something O-claim
clicked O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
brain O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
sat O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
different O-claim
table O-claim
in O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
classes O-claim
, O-claim
sat O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
new O-claim
lunch O-claim
table O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
say O-claim
a O-claim
word O-claim
to O-claim
those O-claim
rude O-claim
girls O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
first O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
intimidated O-claim
by O-claim
the O-claim
ladies O-claim
who O-claim
were O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
top O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
class O-claim
, O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
who O-claim
I O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
sit O-claim
by O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
chat O-claim
with O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
ask O-claim
me O-claim
about O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
day O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
strolled O-claim
into O-claim
class O-claim
from O-claim
across O-claim
the O-claim
room O-claim
I O-claim
saw O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
new O-claim
friends O-claim
smiling O-claim
and O-claim
waving O-claim
her O-claim
hand O-claim
at O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
words O-claim
she O-claim
said O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
wanted O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
friend O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
Hey O-claim
, O-claim
will O-claim
you O-claim
sit O-claim
by O-claim
me O-claim
please O-claim
? O-claim
' O-claim

Even O-claim
though O-claim
that O-claim
sentence O-claim
is O-claim
asked O-claim
every O-claim
single O-claim
day O-claim
no O-claim
one O-claim
has O-claim
asked O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
sit O-claim
with O-claim
them O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
hot O-claim
minute O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
asking O-claim
people O-claim
and O-claim
getting O-claim
a O-claim
solem O-claim
answer O-claim
of O-claim
, O-claim
` O-claim
I O-claim
guess O-claim
so O-claim
' O-claim
. O-claim

From O-claim
that O-claim
moment O-claim
on O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
constantly O-claim
overjoyed O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
friends O-claim
that O-claim
finally O-claim
reciprocated O-claim
what O-claim
being O-claim
a O-claim
friend O-claim
is O-claim
about O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
forgot O-claim
what O-claim
this O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
. O-claim

Her O-claim
friends O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
communicate O-claim
with O-claim
me O-claim
more O-claim
, O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

Once O-claim
I O-claim
changed O-claim
my O-claim
friend O-claim
group O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
melancholiness O-claim
and O-claim
worries O-claim
faded O-claim
away O-claim
like O-claim
fog O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
window O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
could O-claim
also O-claim
see O-claim
the O-claim
transformation O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
overall O-claim
mood O-claim
, O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
no O-claim
longer O-claim
worried O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
owe O-claim
my O-claim
blissfulness O-claim
to O-claim
these O-claim
ladies O-claim
that O-claim
help O-claim
me O-claim
forget O-claim
my O-claim
past O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
eternally O-claim
grateful O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
though O-claim
bullying O-claim
and O-claim
depression O-claim
was O-claim
tough O-claim
to O-claim
persevere O-claim
through O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
has O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
a O-claim
stronger O-claim
person O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
grown O-claim
a O-claim
large O-claim
tolerance O-claim
for O-claim
words O-claim
as O-claim
well O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
strive O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
others O-claim
grow O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
person O-claim
, O-claim
student O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
learner O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
hope O-claim
to O-claim
bring O-claim
a O-claim
positive O-claim
aura O-claim
to O-claim
anywhere O-claim
I O-claim
may O-claim
go O-claim
in O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
past O-claim
incidents O-claim
have O-claim
lead O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
strong O-claim
and O-claim
independent O-claim
in O-claim
everything O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
try O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
and O-claim
grow O-claim
everyday O-claim
in O-claim
every O-claim
possible O-claim
way O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
. O-claim

Bullying O-claim
and O-claim
depression O-claim
have O-claim
taken O-claim
a O-claim
place O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
negative O-claim
milestone O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
will O-claim
never O-claim
drag O-claim
me O-claim
down O-claim
from O-claim
achieving O-claim
success O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
2 O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
half O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
was O-claim
concerned O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
talk O-claim
much O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
hard O-claim
to O-claim
understand O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
lady O-claim
from O-claim
school O-claim
test O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
then O-claim
she O-claim
sent O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
ISD O-claim
for O-claim
more O-claim
testing O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
said O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
perfect O-claim
candidate O-claim
for O-claim
speech O-claim
therapy O-claim
and O-claim
early O-claim
childhood O-claim
development O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
ECP O-claim
for O-claim
3 O-claim
years O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
graduated O-claim
from O-claim
speech O-claim
therapy O-claim
in O-claim
kindergarten O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
struggled O-claim
learning O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
second O-claim
grade O-claim
my O-claim
teacher O-claim
told O-claim
my O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
worried O-claim
and O-claim
suggested O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
get O-claim
a O-claim
tutor O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
summer O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
found O-claim
a O-claim
lady O-claim
named O-claim
Melissa O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
my O-claim
first O-claim
meeting O-claim
with O-claim
Melissa O-claim
she O-claim
gave O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
a O-claim
website O-claim
and O-claim
suggested O-claim
she O-claim
watch O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
mom O-claim
says O-claim
I B-claim
insisted I-claim
on I-claim
watching I-claim
it I-claim
with I-claim
her I-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
concerned O-claim
about O-claim
how O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
make O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
says O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
relieved O-claim
and O-claim
felt O-claim
hope O-claim
after O-claim
seeing O-claim
it O-claim
because O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
ME O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
video O-claim
about O-claim
dyslexia O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
next O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
met O-claim
with O-claim
Melissa O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
tested O-claim
me O-claim
for O-claim
dyslexia O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
told O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
severely O-claim
dyslexic O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
watched O-claim
the O-claim
video O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
relieved O-claim
at O-claim
first O-claim
but O-claim
then O-claim
I O-claim
realized O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
different O-claim
and O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
like O-claim
being O-claim
different O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
mistake O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
purpose O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
wished O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
be O-claim
normal O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
saw O-claim
Melissa O-claim
2 O-claim
days O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
, O-claim
year O-claim
round O-claim
for O-claim
three O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
half O-claim
years O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
helped O-claim
me O-claim
understand O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
put O-claim
words O-claim
together O-claim
and O-claim
ways O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
with O-claim
spelling O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
taught O-claim
me O-claim
strategies O-claim
and O-claim
introduced O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
an O-claim
app O-claim
called O-claim
Learning O-claim
Ally O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
use O-claim
Learning O-claim
Ally O-claim
to O-claim
this O-claim
day O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
has O-claim
helped O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
love O-claim
books O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
app O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
really O-claim
happy O-claim
because O-claim
i O-claim
love O-claim
stories O-claim
and O-claim
this O-claim
lets O-claim
me O-claim
listen O-claim
to O-claim
stories O-claim
by O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

Stories O-claim
let O-claim
me O-claim
go O-claim
places O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
, O-claim
sometimes O-claim
sad O-claim
places O-claim
and O-claim
sometimes O-claim
happy O-claim
places O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
fourth O-claim
grade O-claim
the O-claim
school O-claim
agreed O-claim
to O-claim
have O-claim
the O-claim
ISD O-claim
test O-claim
me O-claim
again O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
learning O-claim
disability O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
was O-claim
done O-claim
during O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
like O-claim
it O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
like O-claim
other O-claim
kids O-claim
would O-claim
think O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
stupid O-claim
and O-claim
that O-claim
maybe O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
stupid O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wished O-claim
that O-claim
the O-claim
school O-claim
would O-claim
just O-claim
believe O-claim
me O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
tested O-claim
again O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
school O-claim
does O-claim
n't O-claim
use O-claim
the O-claim
word O-claim
dyslexia O-claim
but O-claim
the O-claim
test O-claim
showed O-claim
that O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
big O-claim
difference O-claim
between O-claim
how O-claim
smart O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
ability O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
and O-claim
write O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
school O-claim
was O-claim
then O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
special O-claim
plans O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
try O-claim
and O-claim
help O-claim
me O-claim
stay O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
level O-claim
as O-claim
other O-claim
kids O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
understand O-claim
everything O-claim
that O-claim
they O-claim
are O-claim
learning O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
brain O-claim
needs O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
challenged O-claim
just O-claim
like O-claim
theirs O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
still O-claim
hard O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
and O-claim
write O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
given O-claim
apps O-claim
for O-claim
reading O-claim
that O-claim
sounded O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
robot O-claim
and O-claim
writings O-claim
that O-claim
gave O-claim
me O-claim
words O-claim
that O-claim
it O-claim
thought O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
spelling O-claim
and O-claim
often O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
wrong O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
some O-claim
big O-claim
words O-claim
and O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
try O-claim
and O-claim
use O-claim
them O-claim
but O-claim
struggled O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
n't O-claim
read O-claim
the O-claim
words O-claim
the O-claim
computer O-claim
offered O-claim
or O-claim
I O-claim
may O-claim
have O-claim
chosen O-claim
the O-claim
wrong O-claim
word O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
made O-claim
feel O-claim
stupid O-claim
and O-claim
less O-claim
willing O-claim
to O-claim
try O-claim
big O-claim
words O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
new O-claim
apps O-claim
were O-claim
offered O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
unwilling O-claim
to O-claim
try O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
just O-claim
be O-claim
another O-claim
disappointment O-claim
. O-claim

Technology O-claim
is O-claim
getting O-claim
better O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
does O-claim
n't O-claim
feel O-claim
fast O-claim
enough O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
n't O-claim
found O-claim
a O-claim
writing O-claim
app O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
really O-claim
works O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wish O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
helmet O-claim
that O-claim
reads O-claim
my O-claim
brain O-claim
and O-claim
writes O-claim
it O-claim
down O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
learned O-claim
is O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
see O-claim
whole O-claim
pictures O-claim
and O-claim
struggle O-claim
to O-claim
communicate O-claim
my O-claim
idea O-claim
. O-claim

An O-claim
example O-claim
is O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
m O-claim
working O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
to O-claim
build O-claim
something O-claim
, O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
love O-claim
building O-claim
and O-claim
designing O-claim
things O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
in O-claim
order O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
me O-claim
he B-claim
needs I-claim
to I-claim
see I-claim
my I-claim
idea I-claim
on I-claim
paper I-claim
or I-claim
have I-claim
it I-claim
explained I-claim
in I-claim
detail I-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
idea O-claim
is O-claim
clear O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
head O-claim
but O-claim
getting O-claim
that O-claim
on O-claim
paper O-claim
or O-claim
sometimes O-claim
even O-claim
verbally O-claim
breaking O-claim
it O-claim
into O-claim
pieces O-claim
is O-claim
difficult O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
understand O-claim
that O-claim
dyslexia O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
way O-claim
my O-claim
brain O-claim
is O-claim
wired O-claim
, O-claim
giving O-claim
me O-claim
gifts O-claim
that O-claim
others O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
as O-claim
well O-claim
as O-claim
making O-claim
some O-claim
things O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
writing O-claim
and O-claim
reading O-claim
really O-claim
hard O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
wo O-claim
n't O-claim
overcome O-claim
dyslexia O-claim
by O-claim
not O-claim
be O-claim
dyslexic O-claim
anymore O-claim
. O-claim

What B-claim
I I-claim
can I-claim
overcome I-claim
is I-claim
how I-claim
I I-claim
feel I-claim
about I-claim
it I-claim
and I-claim
how I-claim
I I-claim
feel I-claim
about I-claim
myself I-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
m O-claim
not O-claim
a O-claim
mistake O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
m O-claim
supposed O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
this O-claim
was O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
share O-claim
my O-claim
gifts O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

Stress O-claim
is O-claim
that O-claim
start O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
broken O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

Blame O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
birth O-claim
of O-claim
a O-claim
stressful O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

Anger O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
beginning O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
dreary O-claim
lifestyle O-claim
. O-claim

Negativity B-claim
is I-claim
not I-claim
how I-claim
anyone I-claim
wants I-claim
to I-claim
live I-claim
their I-claim
life I-claim
, O-claim
yet O-claim
tons O-claim
of O-claim
people O-claim
live O-claim
their O-claim
life O-claim
full O-claim
of O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

Sometimes O-claim
everything O-claim
seems O-claim
to O-claim
happen O-claim
at O-claim
once O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
is O-claim
no O-claim
excuse O-claim
to O-claim
start O-claim
a O-claim
gloomy O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
past O-claim
nine O-claim
years O-claim
, O-claim
Grandma O-claim
Lynne O-claim
has O-claim
gone O-claim
through O-claim
a O-claim
plethora O-claim
of O-claim
challenges O-claim
and O-claim
difficulties O-claim
. O-claim

Through O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
hardships O-claim
, O-claim
stress O-claim
spread O-claim
across O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
all O-claim
learned O-claim
to O-claim
thrive O-claim
and O-claim
grow O-claim
from O-claim
experiencing O-claim
the O-claim
weight O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
illnesses O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
long O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
remember O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
was O-claim
kind O-claim
and O-claim
thoughtful O-claim
every O-claim
time O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
there O-claim
and O-claim
an O-claim
argument O-claim
took O-claim
place O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
found O-claim
a O-claim
way O-claim
to O-claim
please O-claim
everyone O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
family O-claim
loved O-claim
and O-claim
cherished O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
Lynne O-claim
; O-claim
we O-claim
still O-claim
do O-claim
! O-claim

Whenever O-claim
we O-claim
saw O-claim
her O-claim
, O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
rare O-claim
occasion O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
used O-claim
every O-claim
single O-claim
second O-claim
to O-claim
love O-claim
her O-claim
and O-claim
appreciate O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
family O-claim
was O-claim
connected O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
special O-claim
occasion O-claim
basis O-claim
only O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
see O-claim
her O-claim
much O-claim
, O-claim
only O-claim
on O-claim
special O-claim
occasions O-claim
such O-claim
as O-claim
birthdays O-claim
, O-claim
Christmas O-claim
, O-claim
Easter O-claim
and O-claim
Thanksgiving O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
somewhat O-claim
distant O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
, O-claim
except O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
talked O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
over O-claim
the O-claim
phone O-claim
and O-claim
sometimes O-claim
he O-claim
would O-claim
visit O-claim
her O-claim
after O-claim
work O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
put O-claim
forth O-claim
a O-claim
ton O-claim
of O-claim
effort O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
us O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
house O-claim
or O-claim
vise O-claim
versa O-claim
, O-claim
still O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
rarely O-claim
happened O-claim
. O-claim

Struggles B-claim
can I-claim
always I-claim
be I-claim
overcome I-claim
with I-claim
the I-claim
correct I-claim
mindset I-claim
and I-claim
some I-claim
encouragement I-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grandma O-claim
Lynne O-claim
has O-claim
gone O-claim
through O-claim
many O-claim
health O-claim
issues O-claim
which O-claim
lead O-claim
to O-claim
an O-claim
unhealthy O-claim
mindset O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
2009 O-claim
, O-claim
Grandma O-claim
Lynne O-claim
had O-claim
an O-claim
aneurysm O-claim
in O-claim
her O-claim
brain O-claim
that O-claim
popped O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
rushed O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
University O-claim
of O-claim
Michigan O-claim
hospital O-claim
in O-claim
Ann O-claim
Arbor O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
recovering O-claim
as O-claim
well O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
circumstances O-claim
would O-claim
allow O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
the O-claim
time O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
siblings O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
were O-claim
being O-claim
homeschooled O-claim
so O-claim
we O-claim
stayed O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
Brighton O-claim
area O-claim
so O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
could O-claim
me O-claim
close O-claim
to O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
about O-claim
two O-claim
months O-claim
of O-claim
traveling O-claim
to O-claim
and O-claim
fro O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
was O-claim
finally O-claim
brought O-claim
back O-claim
to O-claim
an O-claim
assisted O-claim
living O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
from O-claim
there O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
strengthened O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
in O-claim
her O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
with O-claim
help O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
about O-claim
four O-claim
months O-claim
since O-claim
the O-claim
aneurysm O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
lived O-claim
with O-claim
assistance O-claim
for O-claim
two O-claim
months O-claim
and O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
finally O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
function O-claim
mostly O-claim
normal O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
was O-claim
extremely O-claim
difficult O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
relatives O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
supported O-claim
her O-claim
and O-claim
guided O-claim
her O-claim
through O-claim
this O-claim
mountain O-claim
in O-claim
her O-claim
life O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
know O-claim
that O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
mountain O-claim
in O-claim

Through O-claim
this O-claim
detrimental O-claim
experience O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
had O-claim
become O-claim
angry O-claim
at O-claim
God O-claim
. O-claim

Anger O-claim
is O-claim
a O-claim
perfectly O-claim
normal O-claim
human O-claim
emotion O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
feel O-claim
uneasy O-claim
and O-claim
hurt O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
love O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
her O-claim
to O-claim
experience O-claim
the O-claim
joy O-claim
of O-claim
having O-claim
an O-claim
intimate O-claim
relationship O-claim
with O-claim
God O-claim
. O-claim

Through O-claim
her O-claim
mental O-claim
stabilization O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
acting O-claim
happier O-claim
and O-claim
more O-claim
free O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
finally O-claim
thought O-claim
that O-claim
maybe O-claim
she O-claim
could O-claim
see O-claim
that O-claim
God O-claim
has O-claim
a O-claim
reason O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
pain O-claim
and O-claim
suffering O-claim
when O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
diagnosed O-claim
with O-claim
lung O-claim
cancer O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
found O-claim
out O-claim
about O-claim
this O-claim
, O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
many O-claim
tears O-claim
and O-claim
lots O-claim
of O-claim
worry O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
first O-claim
thing O-claim
that O-claim
flashed O-claim
through O-claim
my O-claim
head O-claim
was O-claim
her O-claim
mental O-claim

. O-claim

Has O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
this O-claim
been O-claim
for O-claim
nothing O-claim
? O-claim

Almost O-claim
every O-claim
day O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
pondered O-claim
over O-claim
the O-claim
situation O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grandma O-claim
will O-claim
surely O-claim
never O-claim
forgive O-claim
God O-claim
now O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
blamed O-claim
myself O-claim
for O-claim
not O-claim
sharing O-claim
the O-claim
Lord O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
, O-claim
for O-claim
not O-claim
letting O-claim
her O-claim
know O-claim
about O-claim
the O-claim
joys O-claim
of O-claim
having O-claim
a O-claim
relationship O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
Lord O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
longed O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
, O-claim
more O-claim
than O-claim
anything O-claim
, O-claim
to O-claim
love O-claim
the O-claim
Lord O-claim
as O-claim
much O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

Each O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
prayed O-claim
but O-claim
nothing O-claim
seemed O-claim
to O-claim
happen O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
giving O-claim
up O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
crisp O-claim
autumn O-claim
day O-claim
at O-claim
church O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
pastor O-claim
spoke O-claim
about O-claim
using O-claim
your O-claim
pain O-claim
to O-claim
praise O-claim
God O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
heard O-claim
this O-claim
sermon O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
home O-claim
and O-claim
prayed O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
prayed O-claim
to O-claim
God O-claim
that O-claim
he O-claim
would O-claim
use O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
pain O-claim
to O-claim
benefit O-claim
her O-claim
and O-claim
help O-claim
her O-claim
grow O-claim
and O-claim
thirst O-claim
for O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
then O-claim
realized O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
blame O-claim
myself O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
and O-claim
to O-claim
let O-claim
go O-claim
and O-claim
give O-claim
it O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
God O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
that O-claim
moment O-claim
, O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
exactly O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

Through O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
hardships O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
now O-claim
know O-claim
to O-claim
let O-claim
God O-claim
handle O-claim
everything O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
used O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
pain O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
to O-claim
realize O-claim
he O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
only O-claim
one O-claim
in O-claim
control O-claim
. O-claim

Everything O-claim
will O-claim
work O-claim
itself O-claim
out O-claim
and O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
, O-claim
wonderful O-claim
things O-claim
can O-claim
happen O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grandma O-claim
is O-claim
still O-claim
battle O-claim
cancer O-claim
today O-claim
and O-claim
is O-claim
recovering O-claim
. O-claim

Still O-claim
working O-claim
out O-claim
mentally O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
is O-claim
using O-claim
her O-claim
pain O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
better O-claim
, O-claim
which O-claim
is O-claim
exactly O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

For O-claim
some O-claim
, O-claim
this O-claim
just O-claim
a O-claim
shallow O-claim
word O-claim
to O-claim
describe O-claim
blood O-claim
relation O-claim
. O-claim

To O-claim
others O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
has O-claim
a O-claim
much O-claim
deeper O-claim
meaning O-claim
. O-claim

Family O-claim
is O-claim
a O-claim
word O-claim
to O-claim
describe O-claim
the O-claim
people O-claim
you O-claim
are O-claim
closest O-claim
to O-claim
and O-claim
can O-claim
trust O-claim
with O-claim
your O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

Family O-claim
helps O-claim
you O-claim
up O-claim
when O-claim
you O-claim
fall O-claim
or O-claim
save O-claim
you O-claim
when O-claim
you O-claim
're O-claim
drowning O-claim
in O-claim
whatever O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
decides O-claim
to O-claim
flood O-claim
you O-claim
with O-claim
. O-claim

Family O-claim
is O-claim
, O-claim
no O-claim
matter O-claim
what O-claim
, O-claim
are O-claim
always O-claim
there O-claim
for O-claim
you O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
younger O-claim
, O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
no O-claim
one O-claim
who O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
ever O-claim
more O-claim
excited O-claim
to O-claim
visit O-claim
than O-claim
my O-claim
Grandma O-claim
Smith O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
meant O-claim
everything O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
one O-claim
who O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
around O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
is O-claim
, O-claim
until O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
we O-claim
lost O-claim
her O-claim
, O-claim
nothing O-claim
seemed O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
sense O-claim
anymore O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
can O-claim
still O-claim
remember O-claim
the O-claim
week O-claim
she O-claim
died O-claim
like O-claim
it O-claim
happened O-claim
yesterday O-claim
, O-claim
down O-claim
to O-claim
almost O-claim
every O-claim
last O-claim
bitter O-claim
detail O-claim
. O-claim

Inside O-claim
my O-claim
forgetful O-claim
mind O-claim
, O-claim
this O-claim
is O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
only O-claim
memories O-claim
that O-claim

Dreading O-claim
the O-claim
next O-claim
time O-claim
you O-claim
see O-claim
her O-claim
, O-claim
trying O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
better O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
mess O-claim
but O-claim
all O-claim
you O-claim
are O-claim
getting O-claim
in O-claim
return O-claim
is O-claim
a O-claim
eye O-claim
roll O-claim
or O-claim
the O-claim
cold O-claim
shoulder O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
worst O-claim
part O-claim
is O-claim
not O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
you O-claim
have O-claim
done O-claim
ever O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
is O-claim
like O-claim
trying O-claim
to O-claim
bring O-claim
a O-claim
water O-claim
deprived O-claim
flower O-claim
back O-claim
from O-claim
wilting O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
happens O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
flower O-claim
keeps O-claim
slowing O-claim
dying O-claim
a O-claim
painful O-claim
long O-claim
death O-claim
, O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
what O-claim
for O-claim
Ava O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
through O-claim
. O-claim

Honestly O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
know O-claim
her O-claim
side O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
story O-claim
because O-claim
, O-claim
every O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
try O-claim
to O-claim
talk O-claim
about O-claim
it O-claim
getting O-claim
brushed O-claim
off O-claim
or O-claim
her O-claim
not O-claim
even O-claim
responding O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
am O-claim
left O-claim
standing O-claim
there O-claim
alone O-claim
with O-claim
no O-claim
one O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
to O-claim
, O-claim
disbelief O-claim
and O-claim
shock O-claim
worn O-claim
on O-claim
my O-claim
face O-claim
. O-claim

Wondering O-claim
how O-claim
someone O-claim
who O-claim
was O-claim
once O-claim
close O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
thought O-claim
of O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
sister O-claim
, O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
as O-claim
distant O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
stranger O-claim
. O-claim

Girls B-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
cruel I-claim
going O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
there O-claim
way O-claim
to O-claim
what O-claim
felt O-claim
as O-claim
though O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
your O-claim
life O-claim
miserable O-claim
, O-claim
calling O-claim
you O-claim
names O-claim
that O-claim
shall O-claim
not O-claim
be O-claim
repeated O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
place O-claim
never O-claim
be O-claim
spoken O-claim
about O-claim
another O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
kindness O-claim
is O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
gave O-claim
and O-claim
in O-claim
return O-claim
getting O-claim
nothing O-claim
not O-claim
even O-claim
a O-claim
slight O-claim
smile O-claim
. O-claim

Ava O-claim

I O-claim
crouched O-claim
below O-claim
the O-claim
branches O-claim

a O-claim
small O-claim
sigh O-claim
of O-claim

Overcoming O-claim
the O-claim
Passing O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
Grandma O-claim

She O-claim
took O-claim
her O-claim
last O-claim
breaths O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
said O-claim
my O-claim
last O-claim
goodbye O-claim
. O-claim

Having O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
's O-claim
death O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
hardest O-claim
things O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

Because O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
lived O-claim
farther O-claim
away O-claim
from O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
get O-claim
to O-claim
visit O-claim
her O-claim
very O-claim
often O-claim
. O-claim

Which O-claim
is O-claim
why O-claim
I O-claim
cherished O-claim
every O-claim
moment O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
would O-claim
visit O-claim
only O-claim
on O-claim
some O-claim
occasions O-claim
like O-claim
Christmas O-claim
, O-claim
spring O-claim
break O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
softball O-claim
tournaments O-claim
near O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

Losing B-claim
someone I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
hard I-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
losing B-claim
a I-claim
family I-claim
member I-claim
is I-claim
devastating I-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
family O-claim
is O-claim
caring O-claim
, O-claim
helpful O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
fun O-claim
. O-claim

Time O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
is O-claim
always O-claim
enjoyable O-claim
, O-claim
hyper O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
active O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
special O-claim
member O-claim
was O-claim
Don O-claim
Nowlin O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
very O-claim
old O-claim
man O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
my O-claim
uncle O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
my O-claim
Uncle O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
were O-claim
very O-claim
close O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
used O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
fishing O-claim
and O-claim
hang O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
always O-claim
went O-claim
to O-claim
his O-claim
house O-claim
for O-claim
family O-claim
reunions O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
memories O-claim
with O-claim
Uncle O-claim
Don O-claim
will O-claim
stay O-claim
with O-claim
me O-claim
forever O-claim
. O-claim

Cancer O-claim
affects O-claim
many O-claim
Americans O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
took O-claim
my O-claim
uncle O-claim
's O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
hard O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
his O-claim
death O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
eventually O-claim
I O-claim
dealt O-claim
with O-claim
him O-claim
not O-claim
being O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
uncle O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
play O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

Uncle O-claim
Don O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
get O-claim
out O-claim
much O-claim
though O-claim
so O-claim
we O-claim
never O-claim
traveled O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
used O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
fishing O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
but O-claim
that O-claim
's O-claim
about O-claim
the O-claim
only O-claim
thing O-claim
we O-claim
traveled O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
Uncle O-claim
Don O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
plant O-claim
crops O-claim
and O-claim
wait O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
seeds O-claim
to O-claim
sprout O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
moved O-claim
about O-claim
one O-claim
month O-claim
later O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
see O-claim
him O-claim
as O-claim
much O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
would O-claim
visit O-claim
him O-claim
every O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
because O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
feeling O-claim
well O-claim
. O-claim

Then O-claim
he O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
more O-claim
sick O-claim
and O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
a O-claim
doctor O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
was O-claim
diagnosed O-claim
with O-claim
Cancer O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
Uncle O-claim
Don O-claim
only O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
limited O-claim
time O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
doctors O-claim
determined O-claim
he O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
alive O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
couple O-claim
months O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
those O-claim
months O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
thought O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
because O-claim
he O-claim
had O-claim
been O-claim
alive O-claim
for O-claim
so O-claim
long O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
were O-claim
wrong O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
ended O-claim
up O-claim
dying O-claim
about O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
later O-claim
. O-claim

Losing O-claim
my O-claim
uncle O-claim
was O-claim
awful O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
feeling O-claim
of O-claim
solumness O-claim
surrounded O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
still O-claim
ponder O-claim
about O-claim
him O-claim
till O-claim
this O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
knew O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
very O-claim
sick O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
that O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
die O-claim
. O-claim

Overcoming O-claim
my O-claim
Uncle O-claim
Don O-claim
's O-claim
death O-claim
was O-claim
hard O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
. O-claim

So O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
find O-claim
ways O-claim
to O-claim
stop O-claim
thinking O-claim
about O-claim
his O-claim
death O-claim
. O-claim

Since O-claim
I O-claim
moved O-claim
away O-claim
from O-claim
him O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
just O-claim
forgetting O-claim
about O-claim
his O-claim
death O-claim
. O-claim

Eventually O-claim
as O-claim
time O-claim
went O-claim
by O-claim
I O-claim
just O-claim
stopped O-claim
thinking O-claim
about O-claim
his O-claim
death O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
focus O-claim
on O-claim
other O-claim
stuff O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
think O-claim
I O-claim
will O-claim
ever O-claim
fully O-claim
forget O-claim
my O-claim
Uncle O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
think O-claim
about O-claim
that O-claim
much O-claim
anymore O-claim
. O-claim

Overcoming B-claim
a I-claim
family I-claim
members I-claim
death I-claim
can I-claim
be I-claim
hard I-claim
but O-claim
not B-claim
overcoming I-claim
it I-claim
is I-claim
even I-claim
harder I-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
summer O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
losing O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
best O-claim
friends O-claim
or O-claim
even O-claim
a O-claim
loved O-claim
one O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
challenging O-claim
things O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
life O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
papa O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
best O-claim
twelve O-claim
years O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
wanting O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
people O-claim
smile O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
loved O-claim
doing O-claim
things O-claim
with O-claim
both O-claim
grandsons O-claim
and O-claim
his O-claim
only O-claim
granddaughter O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
he O-claim
did O-claim
more O-claim
with O-claim
me O-claim
since O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
around O-claim
longer O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
great O-claim
when O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
here O-claim
, O-claim
making O-claim
us O-claim
laugh O-claim
. O-claim

Riding O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
car O-claim
he O-claim
told O-claim
stories O-claim
that O-claim
were O-claim
somewhat O-claim
true O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
lie O-claim
. O-claim

There O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
ton O-claim
of O-claim
fun O-claim
in O-claim
those O-claim
twelve O-claim
years O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
was O-claim
still O-claim
in O-claim
his O-claim
fifties O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
still O-claim
a O-claim
child O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
inside O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
would O-claim
go O-claim
mushroom O-claim
picking O-claim
and O-claim
shining O-claim
for O-claim
deer O-claim
and O-claim
steelhead O-claim
fishing O-claim
and O-claim
sometimes O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
even O-claim
mow O-claim
the O-claim
lawn O-claim
for O-claim
him O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
to O-claim
him O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
still O-claim
not O-claim
do O-claim

right O-claim
to O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
loved O-claim

When O-claim

I O-claim

Anyway O-claim

along O-claim

My O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim

Jonah O-claim

tackled O-claim

the O-claim

up O-claim

Thankfully O-claim
, O-claim
no O-claim

found O-claim

Brendon O-claim
, O-claim
who O-claim
is O-claim
your O-claim
crush O-claim
, O-claim
Aria O-claim
asked O-claim
me O-claim
while O-claim
walking O-claim
home O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
's O-claim
complicated O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
are O-claim
n't O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
spotted O-claim
by O-claim
the O-claim
Algerians O-claim
, O-claim
said O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
French O-claim
spy O-claim
, O-claim
hiding O-claim
from O-claim
behind O-claim
the O-claim
rock O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
what O-claim
happens O-claim
if O-claim
we O-claim
are O-claim
spotted O-claim
? O-claim
asked O-claim
the O-claim
second O-claim
spy O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
kill O-claim
the O-claim
person O-claim
who O-claim
spots O-claim
us O-claim
. O-claim

Simple O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
answered O-claim
. O-claim

All O-claim
we O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
is O-claim
gather O-claim
intel O-claim
on O-claim
their O-claim
military O-claim
. O-claim

Although O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
disappointed O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
spread O-claim
of O-claim
weapons O-claim
they O-claim
have O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
second O-claim
spy O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
The O-claim
only O-claim
weapons O-claim
and O-claim
armor O-claim
they O-claim
have O-claim
are O-claim
bows O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
occasional O-claim
sword O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
animal O-claim
skin O-claim
shields O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
's O-claim
the O-claim
big O-claim
deal O-claim
? O-claim

The O-claim
big O-claim
deal O-claim
is O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
have O-claim
a O-claim
huge O-claim
advantage O-claim
over O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
figured O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
more O-claim
advanced O-claim
. O-claim

Omari O-claim
glanced O-claim
over O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
passing O-claim
guards O-claim
and O-claim
overheard O-claim
news O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
gathering O-claim

He O-claim
was O-claim
troubled O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
news O-claim
and O-claim
went O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
their O-claim
chief O-claim
immediately O-claim
to O-claim
ascertain O-claim
that O-claim
these O-claim
tidings O-claim
were O-claim
true O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
boldly O-claim
entered O-claim
the O-claim
throne O-claim
room O-claim
and O-claim
bowed O-claim
before O-claim
his O-claim
chief O-claim
. O-claim

Rise O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
the O-claim
Chief O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

Omari O-claim
stood O-claim
and O-claim
addressed O-claim
his O-claim
chief O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
overheard O-claim
the O-claim
village O-claim
guards O-claim
speaking O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
nation O-claim
of O-claim
France O-claim
's O-claim
troops O-claim
arriving O-claim
near O-claim
our O-claim
borders O-claim
. O-claim

These O-claim
tidings O-claim
are O-claim
true O-claim
, O-claim
though O-claim
we O-claim
know O-claim
not O-claim
what O-claim
will O-claim
become O-claim
of O-claim
it O-claim
, O-claim
Chief O-claim
replied O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
know O-claim
very O-claim
little O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
or O-claim
their O-claim
military O-claim
. O-claim

Their O-claim
weapons O-claim
are O-claim
certainly O-claim
more O-claim
advanced O-claim
than O-claim
ours O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
witnessed O-claim
them O-claim
myself O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
spit O-claim
both O-claim
fire O-claim
and O-claim
metal O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
should O-claim
investigate O-claim
and O-claim
send O-claim
a O-claim
small O-claim
party O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
whether O-claim
or O-claim
not O-claim
they O-claim
are O-claim
peaceful O-claim
or O-claim
mean O-claim
us O-claim
harm O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
meantime O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
need O-claim
to O-claim
assemble O-claim
our O-claim
armies O-claim
. O-claim

You O-claim
will O-claim
lead O-claim
the O-claim
party O-claim
to O-claim
our O-claim
border O-claim
. O-claim

You O-claim
are O-claim
now O-claim
dismissed O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
chief O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
Omari O-claim
arrived O-claim
at O-claim
his O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
his O-claim
wife O-claim
was O-claim
mending O-claim
the O-claim
clothes O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
stopped O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
doorway O-claim
and O-claim
she O-claim
looked O-claim
up O-claim
from O-claim
her O-claim
work O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
out O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
scouting O-claim
party O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
must O-claim
have O-claim
a O-claim
feast O-claim
. O-claim

Get O-claim
the O-claim
good O-claim
chicken O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
we O-claim
are O-claim
all O-claim
safe O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
shall O-claim
have O-claim
a O-claim
feast O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
will O-claim
invite O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
neighbors O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
tonight O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
already O-claim
begun O-claim
the O-claim
dinner O-claim
preparations O-claim
, O-claim
she O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
are O-claim
having O-claim
lamb O-claim
cooked O-claim
in O-claim
carrots O-claim
and O-claim
peas O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
ate O-claim
and O-claim
then O-claim
he O-claim
packed O-claim
his O-claim
saddlebags O-claim
, O-claim
got O-claim
on O-claim
his O-claim
horse O-claim
and O-claim
headed O-claim
off O-claim
to O-claim
meet O-claim
the O-claim
rest O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
party O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
his O-claim
party O-claim
arrived O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
borders O-claim
of O-claim
their O-claim
land O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
was O-claim
astonished O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
the O-claim
enormity O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
armies O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
stretched O-claim
as O-claim
far O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
eye O-claim
could O-claim
see O-claim
. O-claim

Omari O-claim
immediately O-claim
understood O-claim
that O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
were O-claim
not O-claim
there O-claim
under O-claim
peaceful O-claim
pretenses O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
were O-claim
heavily O-claim
clad O-claim
in O-claim
armor O-claim
of O-claim
steel O-claim
with O-claim
large O-claim
metal O-claim
barrels O-claim
he O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
recognize O-claim
but O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
look O-claim
harmless O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
soldier O-claim
was O-claim
carrying O-claim
a O-claim
sword O-claim
, O-claim
which O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
rarity O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
seen O-claim
back O-claim
home O-claim
. O-claim

Omari O-claim
glanced O-claim
down O-claim
at O-claim
his O-claim
own O-claim
sword O-claim
, O-claim
given O-claim
to O-claim
him O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
trophy O-claim
won O-claim
in O-claim
battle O-claim
. O-claim

Get O-claim
down O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
rest O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
scout O-claim
party O-claim
retreated O-claim
behind O-claim
a O-claim
large O-claim
hill O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
entirely O-claim
underestimated O-claim
them O-claim
and O-claim
need O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
back O-claim
as O-claim
quickly O-claim
as O-claim
possible O-claim
to O-claim
warn O-claim
the O-claim
chief O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
arrived O-claim
back O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
village O-claim
and O-claim
Omari O-claim
stormed O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
chiefs O-claim
throne O-claim
room O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
are O-claim
entirely O-claim
outnumbered O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
French O-claim
forces O-claim
are O-claim
huge O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
are O-claim
just O-claim
a O-claim
small O-claim
village O-claim
compared O-claim
to O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
will O-claim
leave O-claim
at O-claim
dusk O-claim
to O-claim
use O-claim
the O-claim
night O-claim
as O-claim
cover O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
chief O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

Then O-claim
we O-claim
will O-claim
assemble O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
forces O-claim
we O-claim
have O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
request O-claim
assistance O-claim
from O-claim
our O-claim
friends O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
were O-claim
planning O-claim
their O-claim
attack O-claim
strategy O-claim
when O-claim
they O-claim
heard O-claim
people O-claim
behind O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

Omari O-claim
turned O-claim
around O-claim
and O-claim
saw O-claim
the O-claim
two O-claim
neighboring O-claim
villages O-claim
astride O-claim
their O-claim
horses O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
others O-claim
in O-claim
Omari O-claim
's O-claim
guard O-claim
were O-claim
very O-claim
happy O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
them O-claim
but O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
filled O-claim
with O-claim
dread O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
realization O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
not O-claim
have O-claim
more O-claim
people O-claim
to O-claim
fight O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
would O-claim
only O-claim
have O-claim
more O-claim
people O-claim
to O-claim
slaughter O-claim
. O-claim

Thank O-claim
you O-claim
for O-claim
amassing O-claim
what O-claim
troops O-claim
you O-claim
could O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
said O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
two O-claim
chiefs O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
neighboring O-claim
tribes O-claim
approached O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
await O-claim
your O-claim
command O-claim
, O-claim
said O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
chief O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
are O-claim
happy O-claim
to O-claim
fight O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
noble O-claim
cause O-claim
such O-claim
as O-claim
this O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
other O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
they O-claim
lined O-claim
up O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
battlefield O-claim
the O-claim
chief O-claim
shouted O-claim
, O-claim
Charge O-claim
! O-claim

As O-claim
they O-claim
met O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
soldiers O-claim
, O-claim
Omari O-claim
noticed O-claim
a O-claim
significant O-claim
strength O-claim
advantage O-claim
in O-claim
his O-claim
own O-claim
men O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
had O-claim
too O-claim
many O-claim
troops O-claim
and O-claim
they O-claim
should O-claim
all O-claim
surely O-claim
die O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
not O-claim
without O-claim
taking O-claim
quite O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
French O-claim
with O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
he O-claim
looked O-claim
around O-claim
he O-claim
saw O-claim
his O-claim
own O-claim
men O-claim
being O-claim
cut O-claim
down O-claim
left O-claim
and O-claim
right O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
drew O-claim
his O-claim
sword O-claim
and O-claim
rushed O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
protection O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
nearest O-claim
fallen O-claim
man O-claim
, O-claim
beheading O-claim
any O-claim
French O-claim
who O-claim
came O-claim
close O-claim
. O-claim

Suddenly O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
Frenchmen O-claim
retreated O-claim
and O-claim
Omari O-claim
heard O-claim
a O-claim
huge O-claim
boom O-claim
and O-claim
saw O-claim
eight O-claim
large O-claim
metal O-claim
balls O-claim
hurtling O-claim
toward O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
landed O-claim
at O-claim
his O-claim
side O-claim
, O-claim
exploding O-claim
, O-claim
knocking O-claim
him O-claim
ten O-claim
feet O-claim
away O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
lay O-claim
there O-claim
, O-claim
his O-claim
right O-claim
arm O-claim
bleeding O-claim
profusely O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
crawled O-claim
behind O-claim
a O-claim
rock O-claim
and O-claim
looked O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
other O-claim
canons O-claim
had O-claim
met O-claim
their O-claim
mark O-claim
and O-claim
killed O-claim
every O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
remaining O-claim
soldiers O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
crawled O-claim
over O-claim
to O-claim
his O-claim
horse O-claim
and O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
steadily O-claim
ride O-claim
back O-claim
home O-claim
to O-claim
warn O-claim
his O-claim
village O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
ride O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
fast O-claim
pace O-claim
because O-claim
of O-claim
his O-claim
injury O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
arrived O-claim
home O-claim
to O-claim
find O-claim
his O-claim
village O-claim
in O-claim
ruins O-claim
and O-claim
ash O-claim
. O-claim

Almost O-claim
everyone O-claim
was O-claim
killed O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
land O-claim
was O-claim
claimed O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
French O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
limped O-claim
to O-claim
his O-claim
own O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
find O-claim
it O-claim
half O-claim
destroyed O-claim
, O-claim
still O-claim
ablaze O-claim
. O-claim

Laying O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
doorway O-claim
he O-claim
saw O-claim
his O-claim
wife O-claim
bleeding O-claim
on O-claim
half O-claim
her O-claim
face O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
rushed O-claim
to O-claim
her O-claim
, O-claim
picked O-claim
her O-claim
up O-claim
and O-claim
watched O-claim
her O-claim
take O-claim
her O-claim
final O-claim
breath O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
heard O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
moving O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
best O-claim
days O-claim
ever O-claim
; O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
wait O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
Indiana O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
whole O-claim
moving O-claim
experience O-claim
was O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
horrible O-claim
time O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
just O-claim
settled O-claim
into O-claim
my O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

Before O-claim
we O-claim
moved O-claim
, O-claim
our O-claim
family O-claim
had O-claim
been O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
Michigan O-claim
over O-claim
the O-claim
summer O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
finally O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

While O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
moving O-claim
, O-claim
there O-claim
were O-claim
multiple O-claim
times O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
and O-claim
dad O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
agree O-claim
with O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
, O-claim
then O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
get O-claim
into O-claim
fights O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
move O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
and O-claim
dad O-claim
would O-claim
never O-claim
treat O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
challenges O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
face O-claim
would O-claim
change O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
first O-claim
fix O-claim
our O-claim
family O-claim
did O-claim
when O-claim
we O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
was O-claim
we O-claim
looked O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
in O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
went O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
Michigan O-claim
multiple O-claim
time O-claim
looking O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
rented O-claim
a O-claim
little O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
mean O-claim
little O-claim
, O-claim
house O-claim
near O-claim
the O-claim
water O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
will O-claim
never O-claim
forget O-claim
living O-claim
in O-claim
there O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
whole O-claim
week O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
looked O-claim
at O-claim
around O-claim
fifty O-claim
houses O-claim
and O-claim
finally O-claim
found O-claim
the O-claim
one O-claim
; O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
across O-claim
the O-claim
street O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
water O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
looked O-claim
modern O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
had O-claim
three O-claim
bedrooms O-claim
, O-claim
two O-claim
bathrooms O-claim
, O-claim
a O-claim
big O-claim
living O-claim
room O-claim
, O-claim
a O-claim
bar O-claim
connecting O-claim
the O-claim
kitchen O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
living O-claim
room O-claim
; O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
perfect O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
house O-claim
would O-claim
originally O-claim
be O-claim
rented O-claim
out O-claim
weeks O-claim
at O-claim
a O-claim
time O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
we O-claim
talked O-claim
the O-claim
owner O-claim
into O-claim
let O-claim
us O-claim
buy O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
went O-claim
back O-claim
home O-claim
in O-claim
our O-claim
Indiana O-claim
house O-claim
and O-claim
started O-claim
making O-claim
a O-claim
game O-claim
plan O-claim
. O-claim

First O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
deep O-claim
clean O-claim
the O-claim
whole O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
second O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
host O-claim
an O-claim
open O-claim
house O-claim
so O-claim
people O-claim
who O-claim
are O-claim
looking O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
house O-claim
in O-claim
this O-claim
area O-claim
can O-claim
look O-claim
at O-claim
our O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
if O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
want O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
it O-claim
, O-claim
thirdly O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
crap O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
old O-claim
house O-claim
then O-claim
put O-claim
allin O-claim
our O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
then O-claim
finally O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
done O-claim
with O-claim
most O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
process O-claim
. O-claim

Now O-claim
we O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
clean O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
before O-claim
we O-claim
host O-claim
the O-claim
open O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
tasked O-claim
to O-claim
clean O-claim
my O-claim
room O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
playroom O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
basement O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
started O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
room O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
playroom O-claim
mould O-claim
take O-claim
forever O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
dusted O-claim
off O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
little O-claim
trophies O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
earned O-claim
over O-claim
the O-claim
years O-claim
and O-claim
made O-claim
my O-claim
bed O-claim
. O-claim

Today O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
day O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
open O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
scared O-claim
we O-claim
are O-claim
not O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
find O-claim
anyone O-claim
that O-claim
would O-claim
like O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
our O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
baked O-claim
cookies O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
guests O-claim
, O-claim
put O-claim
some O-claim
water O-claim
out O-claim
, O-claim
vacuumed O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
carpets O-claim
, O-claim
washed O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
hardwood O-claim
floors O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
finally O-claim
we O-claim
dusted O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
pictures O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
left O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
hopeful O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
find O-claim
some O-claim
people O-claim
or O-claim
person O-claim
that O-claim
would O-claim
like O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
our O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

No O-claim
one O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
our O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
worried O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
worried O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
never O-claim
sell O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
hosted O-claim
another O-claim
open O-claim
house O-claim
a O-claim
couple O-claim
weeks O-claim
later O-claim
i O-claim
was O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
school O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
on O-claim
summer O-claim
break O-claim
. O-claim

Finally O-claim
, O-claim
a O-claim
couple O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
signed O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
papers O-claim
, O-claim
now O-claim
we O-claim
just O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
all O-claim
our O-claim
stuff O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
was O-claim
probably O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
stressful O-claim
part O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
move O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
hire O-claim
a O-claim
big O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
from O-claim
U O-claim
Hall O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
take O-claim
us O-claim
two O-claim
trips O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
our O-claim
stuff O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
old O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
were O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
put O-claim
as O-claim
much O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
valuables O-claim
as O-claim
we O-claim
can O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
drive O-claim
to O-claim
our O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
six O-claim
hours O-claim
away O-claim
, O-claim
unload O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
go O-claim
back O-claim
to O-claim
Indiana O-claim
, O-claim
load O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
last O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
things O-claim
, O-claim
go O-claim
back O-claim
to O-claim
our O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
then O-claim
unload O-claim
the O-claim
truck O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
all O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
not O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
take O-claim
the O-claim
moving O-claim
truck O-claim
back O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
UHall O-claim
in O-claim
indiana O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
in O-claim
Michigan O-claim
about O-claim
an O-claim
hour O-claim
away O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
whole O-claim
process O-claim
took O-claim
about O-claim
a O-claim
whole O-claim
week O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
tiring O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
were O-claim
finally O-claim
done O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
move O-claim
, O-claim
now O-claim
all O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
was O-claim
figure O-claim
out O-claim
the O-claim
school O-claim
situation O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
tho O-claim
moving O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
hardest O-claim
things O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
done O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
end O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
worth O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
move O-claim
opened O-claim
me O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
whole O-claim
new O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
now O-claim
know O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
ski O-claim
, O-claim
paddle O-claim
board O-claim
, O-claim
kayak O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
canoe O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
move O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
into O-claim
a O-claim
deep O-claim
depression O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
no O-claim
one O-claim
at O-claim
school O-claim
and O-claim
know O-claim
one O-claim
knew O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Until O-claim
the O-claim
seventh O-claim
grade O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
friends O-claim
, O-claim
now O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
friend O-claim
with O-claim
almost O-claim
everyone O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
school O-claim
( O-claim
mostly O-claim
the O-claim
ones O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
grade O-claim
) O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
when O-claim
i O-claim
had O-claim
all O-claim
these O-claim
friends O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
new O-claim
school O-claim
I O-claim
still O-claim
missed O-claim
a O-claim
friend O-claim
in O-claim
Indiana O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
try O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
him O-claim
when O-claim
we O-claim
drive O-claim
down O-claim
to O-claim
Ohio O-claim
or O-claim
Kentucky O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
family O-claim
for O-claim
Christmas O-claim
or O-claim
Thanksgiving O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
still O-claim
see O-claim
him O-claim
to O-claim
this O-claim
very O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
only O-claim
thing O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
miss O-claim
from O-claim
indian O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
lack O-claim
of O-claim
activities O-claim
, O-claim
also O-claim
I O-claim
hated O-claim
the O-claim
school O-claim
1,000 O-claim
kids O-claim
were O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
grade O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
know O-claim
¾ O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
grade O-claim

Saturday O-claim

6 O-claim
months O-claim
after O-claim
moving O-claim
in O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
animals O-claim
had O-claim
all O-claim
gone O-claim
into O-claim
hibernation O-claim
and O-claim
so O-claim
had O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
people O-claim
except O-claim
he O-claim
Youngers O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
have O-claim
finally O-claim
fully O-claim
settled O-claim
into O-claim
their O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim

Ruth O-claim

weeks O-claim
away O-claim

trouble O-claim
helping O-claim
around O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim

does O-claim
her O-claim
best O-claim
. O-claim

Though O-claim
the O-claim
neighbors O-claim
stayed O-claim
in O-claim
during O-claim
winter O-claim
and O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
come O-claim
back O-claim
out O-claim
til O-claim
spring O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
was O-claim
so O-claim
beautiful O-claim
that O-claim
they O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
care O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
night O-claim
they O-claim
could O-claim
see O-claim
the O-claim
twinkling O-claim
stars O-claim
and O-claim
every O-claim
time O-claim
they O-claim
saw O-claim
them O-claim
MAMA O-claim

tell O-claim
TRAVIS O-claim
that O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
Big O-claim
Walter O-claim
watching O-claim
over O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
inside O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
was O-claim
three O-claim
bedrooms O-claim
with O-claim
enough O-claim
room O-claim
for O-claim
everything O-claim
they O-claim
need O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
middle O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
a O-claim
large O-claim
sitting O-claim
area O-claim
for O-claim
them O-claim
to O-claim

There O-claim

her O-claim
best O-claim
meals O-claim

Plenty O-claim
of O-claim
windows O-claim
so O-claim
they O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
7 O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
laying O-claim
on O-claim
my O-claim

my O-claim
dimly O-claim

After O-claim
that O-claim

I O-claim
thought O-claim
why O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
this O-claim
stuff O-claim
. O-claim

Then O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
asked O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
get O-claim
a O-claim
ps4 O-claim
and O-claim
she O-claim
said O-claim
no O-claim
because O-claim
we O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
enough O-claim
money O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
event O-claim
is O-claim
significant O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
because O-claim
games O-claim
are O-claim
fun O-claim
and O-claim
interesting O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
first O-claim
started O-claim
playing O-claim
games O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
7 O-claim

my O-claim

I O-claim

I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim

Then O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
downloaded O-claim

started O-claim
playing O-claim

I O-claim
liked O-claim

and O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
and O-claim
play O-claim
more O-claim
games O-claim
. O-claim

Later O-claim
, O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
9 O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
playing O-claim
video O-claim
games O-claim
on O-claim
my O-claim

The O-claim
first O-claim

I O-claim
got O-claim
on O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
Roblox O-claim

Later O-claim
that O-claim
year O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
playing O-claim
Roblox O-claim
with O-claim
friends O-claim
from O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

Then O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
play O-claim
harder O-claim
and O-claim
more O-claim
complex O-claim
games O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
better O-claim
consoles O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
more O-claim
games O-claim

After O-claim
that O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
searched O-claim

I O-claim
could O-claim
get O-claim

. O-claim

I O-claim
got O-claim
my O-claim
switch O-claim
from O-claim
saving O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
year O-claim
because O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
buy O-claim
me O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
got O-claim
a O-claim
ps4 O-claim
from O-claim
moving O-claim
in O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
step O-claim
dad O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
spend O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
of O-claim
money O-claim

the O-claim

many O-claim
ways O-claim

These O-claim
things O-claim
have O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim

making O-claim
me O-claim
more O-claim
creative O-claim
and O-claim

My O-claim

my O-claim
life O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
change O-claim
forever O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
kid O-claim
wants O-claim
their O-claim
mom O-claim
and O-claim
dad O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
happy O-claim
and O-claim
love O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
not O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
case O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
divorce O-claim
changed O-claim
me O-claim
in O-claim
ways O-claim
that O-claim
could O-claim
have O-claim
ruined O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
remember O-claim
the O-claim
last O-claim
day O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
together O-claim
when O-claim
we O-claim
walked O-claim
out O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
and O-claim
left O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
knew O-claim
that O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
hard O-claim
having O-claim
to O-claim
constantly O-claim
go O-claim
back O-claim
and O-claim
forth O-claim
from O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
's O-claim
and O-claim
dad O-claim
's O-claim
. O-claim

Once O-claim
they O-claim
got O-claim
the O-claim
divorce O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
became O-claim
angry O-claim
and O-claim
wondered O-claim
, O-claim
Why O-claim
me O-claim
? O-claim

The O-claim
divorce O-claim
was O-claim
hard O-claim
on O-claim
me O-claim
because O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
was O-claim
dramatically O-claim
changed O-claim
and O-claim
would O-claim
never O-claim
be O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
. O-claim

Growing O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
very O-claim
happy O-claim
and O-claim
loving O-claim
child O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
joyful O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
lived O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
green O-claim
woods O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
great O-claim
big O-claim
red O-claim
house O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
built O-claim
for O-claim
our O-claim
family O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
never O-claim
noticed O-claim
any O-claim
fighting O-claim
or O-claim
arguing O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
on O-claim
between O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
always O-claim
thought O-claim
that O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
pleased O-claim
and O-claim
would O-claim
stay O-claim
together O-claim
forever O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
family O-claim
event O-claim
, O-claim
all O-claim
families O-claim
would O-claim
gather O-claim
usually O-claim
just O-claim
talking O-claim
about O-claim
how O-claim
everything O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
or O-claim
how O-claim
the O-claim
kids O-claim
are O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
about O-claim
three O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
during O-claim
this O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
just O-claim
starting O-claim
Kindergarten O-claim
. O-claim

Everything O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
great O-claim
for O-claim
myself O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
sometimes O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
go O-claim
on O-claim
road O-claim
trips O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
laugh O-claim
and O-claim
smile O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
so O-claim
happy O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
notice O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
not O-claim
being O-claim
as O-claim
loving O-claim
to O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
really O-claim
thought O-claim
about O-claim
it O-claim
that O-claim
much O-claim
though O-claim
; O-claim
it O-claim
never O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
that O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
a O-claim
divorce O-claim
. O-claim

Little O-claim
did O-claim
I O-claim
know O-claim
that O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
something O-claim
wrong O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
week O-claim
later O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
, O-claim
sister O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
left O-claim
my O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
different O-claim
one O-claim
leaving O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
few O-claim
days O-claim
later O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
filed O-claim
the O-claim
divorce O-claim
papers O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
divorce O-claim
happened O-claim
, O-claim
something O-claim
snapped O-claim
in O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
heading O-claim
straight O-claim
to O-claim
rock O-claim
bottom O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
started O-claim
stealing O-claim
little O-claim
objects O-claim
from O-claim
stores O-claim
for O-claim
from O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
attitude O-claim
was O-claim
horrible O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
take O-claim
going O-claim
back O-claim
and O-claim
forth O-claim
between O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
's O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
moms O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
sister O-claim
was O-claim
feeling O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
way O-claim
; O-claim
she O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
steal O-claim
anything O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
she O-claim
wanted O-claim
everything O-claim
to O-claim
change O-claim
. O-claim

About O-claim
two O-claim
months O-claim
pass O-claim
by O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
got O-claim
engaged O-claim
to O-claim
now O-claim
known O-claim
as O-claim
my O-claim
step O-claim
- O-claim
mom O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
happy O-claim
for O-claim
him O-claim
so O-claim
he O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
lonely O-claim
anymore O-claim
so O-claim
he O-claim
could O-claim
start O-claim
a O-claim
family O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
nice O-claim
she O-claim
would O-claim
always O-claim
read O-claim
me O-claim
stories O-claim
of O-claim
her O-claim
past O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
's O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
woke O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
step O-claim
- O-claim
mom O-claim
fighting O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
just O-claim
yelling O-claim
; O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
physically O-claim
hurting O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
scared O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
pull O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
off O-claim
of O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
next O-claim
Thursday O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
picked O-claim
me O-claim
up O-claim
early O-claim
from O-claim
school O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
no O-claim
idea O-claim
why O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
with O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
started O-claim
talking O-claim
about O-claim
what O-claim
happened O-claim
last O-claim
night O-claim
and O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
head O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
thinking O-claim
, O-claim
how O-claim
did O-claim
she O-claim
know O-claim
? O-claim

I O-claim
just O-claim
thought O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
told O-claim
her O-claim
or O-claim
something O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
few O-claim
days O-claim
later O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
still O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
moms O-claim
she O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
we O-claim
can O-claim
only O-claim
see O-claim
our O-claim
dad O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
weekend O-claim
if O-claim
we O-claim
wanted O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
really O-claim
a O-claim
relief O-claim
but O-claim
some O-claim
weight O-claim
was O-claim
lifted O-claim
off O-claim
my O-claim
shoulder O-claim
I O-claim
loved O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
I O-claim
liked O-claim
seeing O-claim
him O-claim
but O-claim
after O-claim
that O-claim
night O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
mixed O-claim
emotions O-claim
about O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
his O-claim
house O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
confused O-claim
what O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

About O-claim
five O-claim
years O-claim
have O-claim
past O-claim
since O-claim
the O-claim
change O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
almost O-claim
14 O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
happy O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
still O-claim
wish O-claim
everything O-claim
were O-claim
different O-claim
between O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
but O-claim
that O-claim
is O-claim
never O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
happen O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
Mom O-claim
now O-claim
has O-claim
a O-claim
boyfriend O-claim
I O-claim
think O-claim
he O-claim
is O-claim
great O-claim
he O-claim
reminds O-claim
me O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
am O-claim
still O-claim
only O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
dads O-claim
every O-claim
other O-claim
weekend O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
choose O-claim
to O-claim
only O-claim
go O-claim
once O-claim
a O-claim
month O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
do O-claim
feel O-claim
bad O-claim
that O-claim
he O-claim
does O-claim
not O-claim
see O-claim
his O-claim
children O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
safer O-claim
at O-claim
my O-claim
moms O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
go O-claim
see O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
it O-claim
is O-claim
a O-claim
little O-claim
awkward O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
only O-claim
see O-claim
him O-claim
once O-claim
a O-claim
month O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
is O-claim
hard O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
caught O-claim
up O-claim
on O-claim
everything O-claim
that O-claim
has O-claim
happened O-claim
in O-claim
that O-claim
time O-claim
period O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
my O-claim
moms O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
belong O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
she O-claim
does O-claim
the O-claim
activities O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
like O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
always O-claim
wants O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
hunting O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
not O-claim
into O-claim
killing O-claim
animal O-claim
that O-claim
look O-claim
cute O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
sister O-claim
feels O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
about O-claim
this O-claim
whole O-claim
situation O-claim
she O-claim
does O-claim
not O-claim
realy O-claim
like O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
's O-claim
house O-claim
just O-claim
cause O-claim
there O-claim
is O-claim
not O-claim
that O-claim
much O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
get O-claim
through O-claim
a O-claim
day O-claim
of O-claim
school O-claim
like O-claim
any O-claim
other O-claim
person O-claim
would O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
no O-claim
different O-claim
than O-claim
anyone O-claim
else O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
divorce O-claim
mostly O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
early O-claim
stages O-claim
of O-claim
life O-claim
but O-claim
now O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
happy O-claim
about O-claim
everything O-claim

Change O-claim
is O-claim
inevitable O-claim
for O-claim
anyone O-claim

in O-claim
their O-claim
lives O-claim

Weather O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
something O-claim
small O-claim
or O-claim
a O-claim
huge O-claim
change O-claim
that O-claim
can O-claim
impact O-claim
someone O-claim
's O-claim
life O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
long O-claim
time O-claim

I O-claim
lived O-claim
a O-claim
normal O-claim
happy O-claim
life O-claim

I O-claim
played O-claim
sports O-claim

and O-claim
hung O-claim
out O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
worked O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
construction O-claim
company O-claim
called O-claim
Porter O-claim
Builders O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
worked O-claim
inside O-claim
the O-claim
office O-claim
and O-claim
helped O-claim
with O-claim
stuff O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
computer O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
never O-claim
worked O-claim
outside O-claim

talking O-claim
about O-claim

If O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim

would O-claim
always O-claim
point O-claim
out O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim

Porter O-claim
was O-claim
working O-claim

and O-claim
liked O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
his O-claim

Where O-claim
he O-claim
worked O-claim
is O-claim
n't O-claim
too O-claim
far O-claim
from O-claim
our O-claim
house O-claim
so O-claim
i O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
think O-claim
that O-claim
he O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
reason O-claim
to O-claim
hate O-claim
his O-claim
job O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
just O-claim
did O-claim

Moving O-claim
After O-claim
My O-claim
Parents O-claim
Divorced O-claim

I O-claim
saw O-claim
it O-claim
coming O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
really O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
inevitable O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
heading O-claim
down O-claim
a O-claim
path O-claim
of O-claim
struggle O-claim

unhappiness O-claim

It O-claim
is O-claim
not O-claim
uncommon O-claim
for O-claim
parents O-claim
to O-claim
divorce O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
just O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
expect O-claim
it O-claim
to O-claim
happen O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Divorce O-claim
is O-claim
hard O-claim
for O-claim
anyone O-claim
, O-claim
especially O-claim
younger O-claim
children O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
life O-claim
is O-claim
much O-claim
different O-claim
now O-claim
after O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
divorce O-claim
than O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
before O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
spilt O-claim
changed O-claim
my O-claim
way O-claim
of O-claim
life O-claim
drastically O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
kindergarten O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
got O-claim
along O-claim
fine O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
had O-claim
the O-claim
expected O-claim
quarrels O-claim
from O-claim
time O-claim
to O-claim
time O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
nothing O-claim
of O-claim
major O-claim
significance O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
had O-claim
just O-claim
moved O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
duplex O-claim
that O-claim
were O-claim
living O-claim
in O-claim
, O-claim
into O-claim
my O-claim
grandmother O-claim
's O-claim
house O-claim
that O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
currently O-claim
living O-claim
in O-claim
. O-claim

Summers O-claim
were O-claim
packed O-claim
with O-claim
fun O-claim
and O-claim
bonding O-claim
, O-claim
winters O-claim
brimming O-claim
with O-claim
love O-claim
and O-claim
festivity O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
first O-claim
and O-claim
second O-claim
years O-claim
were O-claim
arguably O-claim
similar O-claim
, O-claim
disagreements O-claim
popping O-claim
up O-claim
more O-claim
often O-claim
, O-claim
becoming O-claim
a O-claim
common O-claim
occurrence O-claim
now O-claim
. O-claim

Third O-claim
year O-claim
they O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
drift O-claim
apart O-claim
even O-claim
further O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
seemed O-claim
to O-claim
disagree O-claim
with O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
on O-claim
everything O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grandmother O-claim
eventually O-claim
moved O-claim
back O-claim
in O-claim
, O-claim
so O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
look O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
house O-claim
to O-claim
rent O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
found O-claim
one O-claim
, O-claim
only O-claim
minutes O-claim
away O-claim
from O-claim
my O-claim
grandmother O-claim
's O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
mellow O-claim
winter O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
fourth O-claim
year O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
moved O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
new O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
shared O-claim
a O-claim
room O-claim
upstairs O-claim
, O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
brother O-claim
had O-claim
rooms O-claim
upstairs O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
room O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
basement O-claim
. O-claim

Something O-claim
was O-claim
coming O-claim
that O-claim
would O-claim
change O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
permanently O-claim
. O-claim

Everything O-claim
changed O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
filed O-claim
for O-claim
divorce O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
really O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
to O-claim
feel O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim
anger O-claim
, O-claim
sadness O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
then O-claim
, O-claim
nothing O-claim
. O-claim

Everything O-claim
became O-claim
a O-claim
fast O-claim
paced O-claim
blur O-claim
of O-claim
emotions O-claim
and O-claim
issues O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
father O-claim
moved O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
basement O-claim
, O-claim
forcing O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
to O-claim
sleep O-claim
upstairs O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
couch O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
my O-claim
father O-claim
planned O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
out O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mother O-claim
began O-claim
looking O-claim
for O-claim
houses O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
afford O-claim
to O-claim
pay O-claim
the O-claim
rent O-claim
by O-claim
herself O-claim
, O-claim
so O-claim
she O-claim
turned O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
grandmother O-claim
, O-claim
asking O-claim
if O-claim
we O-claim
could O-claim
move O-claim
in O-claim
until O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
financially O-claim
stable O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
grandmother O-claim
reluctantly O-claim
agreed O-claim
, O-claim
seeing O-claim
as O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
already O-claim
housing O-claim
my O-claim
aunt O-claim
and O-claim
her O-claim
significant O-claim
other O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
father O-claim
and O-claim
mother O-claim
's O-claim
divorce O-claim
was O-claim
finalized O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
summer O-claim
of O-claim
2016 O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
still O-claim
a O-claim
while O-claim
until O-claim
the O-claim
lease O-claim
ended O-claim
, O-claim
so O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
all O-claim
live O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
tension O-claim
and O-claim
all O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
the O-claim
lease O-claim
let O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
packed O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
our O-claim
stuff O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
began O-claim
moving O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
now O-claim
somber O-claim
winter O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
moved O-claim
into O-claim
the O-claim
Elk O-claim
Rapids O-claim
Apartments O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
into O-claim
my O-claim
grandmothers O-claim
house O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parents O-claim
divorce O-claim
made O-claim
things O-claim
more O-claim
of O-claim
a O-claim
challenge O-claim
on O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
siblings O-claim

Overcoming O-claim
My O-claim
Parent O-claim

Divorce O-claim

We B-claim
do I-claim
n't I-claim
grow I-claim
when I-claim
things I-claim
are I-claim
easy I-claim
; O-claim
we B-claim
grow I-claim
when I-claim
we I-claim
face I-claim
challenges I-claim
( O-claim
Joyce O-claim
Meyer O-claim
) O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
faced O-claim
a O-claim
challenge O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
this O-claim
one O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
empty O-claim
feeling O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
chest O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
eyes O-claim
carried O-claim
tears O-claim
down O-claim
my O-claim
face O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
shirt O-claim
remained O-claim
drenched O-claim
, O-claim
this O-claim
was O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
informed O-claim
me O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
separating O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
experienced O-claim
my O-claim
friend O-claim
's O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
not O-claim
being O-claim
together O-claim
and O-claim
thought O-claim
nothing O-claim
of O-claim
it O-claim
, O-claim
however O-claim
, O-claim
when O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
my O-claim
own O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
different O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
a O-claim
younger O-claim
child O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
understand O-claim
what O-claim
a O-claim
divorce O-claim
was O-claim
, O-claim
all O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
is O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
split O-claim
apart O-claim
. O-claim

What O-claim
kind O-claim
of O-claim
journey O-claim
would O-claim
this O-claim
take O-claim
me O-claim
on O-claim
? O-claim

Am O-claim
I O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
feel O-claim
this O-claim
way O-claim
forever O-claim
? O-claim

I O-claim
knew O-claim
my O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
divorce O-claim
would O-claim
affect O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
also O-claim
knew O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
my O-claim
greatest O-claim
and O-claim
hardest O-claim
obstacle O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
. O-claim

Growing O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
there O-claim
, O-claim
at O-claim
constant O-claim
care O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
a O-claim
cushion O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
lean O-claim
on O-claim
. O-claim

Family O-claim
means O-claim
everything O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
, O-claim
although O-claim
when O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
torn O-claim
apart O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
adjustment O-claim
can O-claim
be O-claim
difficult O-claim
. O-claim

One O-claim
day O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
together O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
suddenly O-claim
the O-claim
next O-claim
day O-claim
, O-claim
they O-claim
're O-claim
not O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
challenging O-claim
part O-claim
about O-claim
this O-claim
is O-claim
not O-claim
being O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
them O-claim
together O-claim
again O-claim
. O-claim

Before O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
this O-claim
happened O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
a O-claim
tight O-claim
- O-claim
knit O-claim
family O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
grateful O-claim
and O-claim
appreciative O-claim
of O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
typical O-claim
average O-claim
family O-claim
that O-claim
spent O-claim
time O-claim
on O-claim
vacation O-claim
together O-claim
, O-claim
dined O-claim
out O-claim
to O-claim
eat O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
weekends O-claim
. O-claim

Celebrated O-claim
our O-claim
birthdays O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
kept O-claim
god O-claim
first O-claim
and O-claim
cherished O-claim
our O-claim
Sunday O-claim
mornings O-claim
at O-claim
church O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
had O-claim
our O-claim
joyful O-claim
and O-claim
sorrow O-claim
or O-claim
angered O-claim
moments O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
through O-claim
it O-claim
all O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
there O-claim
for O-claim
one O-claim
another O-claim
. O-claim

Except O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
past O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
all O-claim
pleasant O-claim
times O-claim
together O-claim
were O-claim
over O-claim
, O-claim
It O-claim
was O-claim
time O-claim
to O-claim
start O-claim
a O-claim
new O-claim
chapter O-claim
in O-claim
our O-claim
lives O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
separation O-claim
between O-claim
two O-claim
individuals O-claim
can O-claim
be O-claim
strenuous O-claim
on O-claim
everyone O-claim
's O-claim
relationship O-claim
, O-claim
especially O-claim
when O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
my O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
. O-claim

Once O-claim
I O-claim
realized O-claim
what O-claim
was O-claim
happening O-claim
between O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
would O-claim
change O-claim
forever O-claim
. O-claim

Many O-claim
more O-claim
problems O-claim
arose O-claim
after O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
separated O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
disagreed O-claim
on O-claim
when O-claim
each O-claim
parent O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
alternated O-claim
between O-claim
houses O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
dad O-claim
moved O-claim
out O-claim
and O-claim
in O-claim
with O-claim
his O-claim
brother O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
remained O-claim
living O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
childhood O-claim
home O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
the O-claim
divorce O-claim
progressed O-claim
on O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
eventually O-claim
found O-claim
his O-claim
own O-claim
place O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
sister O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
struggled O-claim
with O-claim
moving O-claim
back O-claim
and O-claim
forth O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
continuous O-claim
strain O-claim
on O-claim
us O-claim
mentally O-claim
, O-claim
having O-claim
to O-claim
remember O-claim
whose O-claim
house O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
at O-claim
that O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
item O-claim
we O-claim
wanted O-claim
or O-claim
needed O-claim
, O-claim
from O-claim
clothes O-claim
and O-claim
shoes O-claim
we O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
wear O-claim
, O-claim
or O-claim
supplies O-claim
for O-claim
school O-claim
the O-claim
next O-claim
day O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
grab O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
disliked O-claim
moving O-claim
between O-claim
houses O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
only O-claim
place O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
stay O-claim
was O-claim
at O-claim
home O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
house O-claim
I O-claim
lived O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
whole O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
where O-claim
the O-claim
pumpkin O-claim
pie O-claim
scented O-claim
candle O-claim
aroma O-claim
filled O-claim
the O-claim
air O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
comfort O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
gray O-claim
L O-claim
shaped O-claim
couch O-claim
where O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
rest O-claim
my O-claim
eyes O-claim
after O-claim
a O-claim
long O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
house O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
old O-claim
childhood O-claim
memories O-claim
I O-claim
cherished O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
's O-claim
where O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
time O-claim
went O-claim
on O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
relationship O-claim
became O-claim
worse O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
found O-claim
myself O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
middle O-claim
of O-claim
their O-claim
conversations O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
the O-claim
one O-claim
telling O-claim
them O-claim
what O-claim
the O-claim
other O-claim
parent O-claim
said O-claim
. O-claim

Instead O-claim
of O-claim
them O-claim
talking O-claim
to O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
go O-claim
through O-claim
me O-claim
or O-claim
my O-claim
sister O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
more O-claim
arguments O-claim
and O-claim
disagreements O-claim
they O-claim
had O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
more O-claim
they O-claim
stopped O-claim
communicating O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
communication O-claim
amongst O-claim
them O-claim
stopped O-claim
all O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
sister O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
were O-claim
the O-claim
ones O-claim
left O-claim
to O-claim
communicate O-claim
. O-claim

During O-claim
the O-claim
divorce O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
closed O-claim
myself O-claim
off O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
kept O-claim
everything O-claim
inside O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
afraid O-claim
to O-claim
tell O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
thought O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
hurt O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
eventually O-claim
told O-claim
them O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
afraid O-claim
anymore O-claim
. O-claim

For O-claim
a O-claim
year O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
wished O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
wished O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
back O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
finally O-claim
realized O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
n't O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
back O-claim
together O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
needed O-claim
to O-claim
learn O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
with O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
parent O-claim
's O-claim
divorce O-claim
was O-claim
final O-claim
, O-claim
both O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
searched O-claim
for O-claim
love O-claim
again O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
care O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
were O-claim
dating O-claim
other O-claim
people O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
just O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
them O-claim
content O-claim
in O-claim
their O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

They O-claim
eventually O-claim
got O-claim
remarried O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
this O-claim
benefited O-claim
me O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
positive O-claim
way O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
gained O-claim
more O-claim
family O-claim
than O-claim
I O-claim
thought O-claim
I O-claim
ever O-claim
would O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
I O-claim
ca O-claim
n't O-claim
change O-claim
what O-claim
happened O-claim
between O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
have O-claim
learned O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
how O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
is O-claim
now O-claim
. O-claim

This O-claim
divorce O-claim
has O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim
tremendously O-claim
in O-claim
many O-claim
ways O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
overcame O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
though O-claim
my O-claim
parents O-claim
divorce O-claim
has O-claim
affected O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
hardest O-claim
thing O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
outcome O-claim
of O-claim
this O-claim
divorce O-claim
has O-claim
negatives O-claim
and O-claim
positives O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
am O-claim
a O-claim
stronger O-claim
person O-claim
and O-claim
know O-claim
I B-claim
can I-claim
handle I-claim
anything I-claim
life I-claim
throws I-claim
at I-claim
me I-claim
. O-claim

Although O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
split O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
gained O-claim
family O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
process O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
feel O-claim
more O-claim
loved O-claim
than O-claim
I O-claim
ever O-claim
have O-claim
before O-claim

Overcoming O-claim

has O-claim
changed O-claim
my O-claim

both O-claim

My O-claim
life O-claim

continue O-claim

be I-claim
a I-claim
problem I-claim
. O-claim

Well O-claim
, O-claim
to O-claim
some O-claim
people O-claim
they O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
want O-claim
to O-claim
drive O-claim
because O-claim
events O-claim
happened O-claim
to O-claim
them O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
past O-claim
and O-claim
now O-claim
draw O-claim
a O-claim
fear O-claim
of O-claim
riding O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
car O-claim
, O-claim
similar O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
2016 O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
involved O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
car O-claim
accident O-claim
while O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
was O-claim
driving O-claim
and O-claim
happened O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
traumatic O-claim
event O-claim
that O-claim
has O-claim
ever O-claim
occurred O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
am O-claim
here O-claim
to O-claim
tell O-claim
the O-claim
story O-claim
of O-claim
before O-claim
, O-claim
during O-claim
and O-claim
, O-claim
after O-claim
the O-claim
event O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
it O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
look O-claim
at O-claim
everything O-claim
from O-claim
a O-claim
different O-claim
perspective O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
day O-claim
the O-claim
event O-claim
occurred O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
day O-claim
where O-claim
the O-claim
sun O-claim
plowed O-claim
through O-claim
the O-claim
clouds O-claim
, O-claim
beams O-claim
of O-claim
light O-claim
going O-claim
in O-claim
every O-claim
direction O-claim
, O-claim
casting O-claim
our O-claim
shadows O-claim
out O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
field O-claim
. O-claim

Our O-claim
softball O-claim
team O-claim
had O-claim
practice O-claim
from O-claim
4:30 O-claim
to O-claim
6:00 O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
softball O-claim
fields O-claim
in O-claim
Kewadin O-claim
MI O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
scorching O-claim
sun O-claim
hit O-claim
down O-claim
on O-claim
our O-claim
backs O-claim
while O-claim
out O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
rough O-claim
sand O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
time O-claim
, O-claim
small O-claim
rocks O-claim
hit O-claim
our O-claim
faces O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
ball O-claim
rapidly O-claim
heads O-claim
towards O-claim
us O-claim
. O-claim

Softball O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
greatest O-claim
sport O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
over O-claim
the O-claim
course O-claim
of O-claim
summer O-claim
, O-claim
for O-claim
three O-claim
days O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
, O-claim
five O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
half O-claim
hours O-claim
in O-claim
total O-claim
. O-claim

Being O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
spend O-claim
time O-claim
doing O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
love O-claim
. O-claim

While O-claim
having O-claim
the O-claim
ability O-claim
to O-claim
gain O-claim
and O-claim
grow O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
experiences O-claim
and O-claim
connections O-claim
obtained O-claim
during O-claim
sports O-claim
where O-claim
humans O-claim
can O-claim
grow O-claim
a O-claim
family O-claim
and O-claim
have O-claim
a O-claim
special O-claim
bond O-claim
during O-claim
the O-claim
sport O-claim
but O-claim
also O-claim
a O-claim
family O-claim
off O-claim
the O-claim
field O-claim
or O-claim
court O-claim
. O-claim

Softball O-claim
is O-claim
genuinely O-claim
important O-claim
to O-claim
myself O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
allows O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
the O-claim
anger O-claim
out O-claim
and O-claim
use O-claim
it O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
good O-claim
way O-claim
such O-claim
as O-claim
hitting O-claim
the O-claim
ball O-claim
or O-claim
throwing O-claim
the O-claim
ball O-claim
very O-claim
hard O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
this O-claim
time O-claim
the O-claim
day O-claim
was O-claim
great O-claim
besides O-claim
the O-claim
fact O-claim
the O-claim
heat O-claim
was O-claim
hot O-claim
and O-claim
drowning O-claim
our O-claim
energy O-claim
from O-claim
really O-claim
being O-claim
able O-claim
to O-claim
focus O-claim
on O-claim
anything O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
only O-claim
subject O-claim
on O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
during O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
practice O-claim
was O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
home O-claim
because O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
scorching O-claim
hot O-claim
outside O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
have O-claim
passed O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

Practice O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
a O-claim
close O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
get O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
car O-claim
where O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
cold O-claim
air O-claim
blowing O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
vents O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
headed O-claim
home O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
conversation O-claim
about O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
teammates O-claim
and O-claim
as O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
approaching O-claim
the O-claim
stop O-claim
sign O-claim
she O-claim
stopped O-claim
talking O-claim
abruptly O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
first O-claim
I O-claim
found O-claim
this O-claim
very O-claim
strange O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
had O-claim
the O-claim
idea O-claim
that O-claim
maybe O-claim
something O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
her O-claim
mind O-claim
or O-claim
she O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
clear O-claim
her O-claim
throat O-claim
. O-claim

Suspended O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
cloud O-claim
, O-claim
hanging O-claim
my O-claim
feet O-claim
' O-claim
inches O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
ground O-claim
, O-claim
still O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
nowhere O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
stuck O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
know O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

Since O-claim
the O-claim
beginning O-claim
of O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
, O-claim
all O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
remember O-claim
is O-claim
this O-claim
feeling O-claim
of O-claim
being O-claim
stopped O-claim
, O-claim
being O-claim
in O-claim
this O-claim
unfamiliar O-claim
time O-claim
loop O-claim
of O-claim
no O-claim
end O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
happy O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
enjoying O-claim
the O-claim
great O-claim
wanderlust O-claim
of O-claim
life O-claim
, O-claim
or O-claim
the O-claim
breathtaking O-claim
nature O-claim
surrounding O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
pretended O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
okay O-claim
even O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
usually O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
, O-claim
every O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
put O-claim
on O-claim
this O-claim
confident O-claim
image O-claim
, O-claim
of O-claim
someone O-claim
who O-claim
I O-claim
wish O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
struggled O-claim
with O-claim
being O-claim
accepted O-claim
yet O-claim
I O-claim
barely O-claim
ever O-claim
told O-claim
any O-claim
family O-claim
or O-claim
friends O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
, O-claim
or O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
really O-claim
felt O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
shut O-claim
down O-claim
, O-claim
became O-claim
someone O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
not O-claim
proud O-claim
of O-claim
after O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
let O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
feeling O-claim
dictate O-claim
certain O-claim
aspects O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
lost O-claim
and O-claim
confused O-claim
because O-claim
on O-claim
one O-claim
hand O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
keep O-claim
my O-claim
friends O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
never O-claim
be O-claim
lonely O-claim
, O-claim
though O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
the O-claim
right O-claim
choice O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
kept O-claim
going O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
once O-claim
realized O-claim
that O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
doing O-claim
hurt O-claim
me O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
people O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
trust O-claim
so O-claim
an O-claim
abundance O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
emotions O-claim
were O-claim
bottled O-claim
up O-claim
inside O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Sometimes O-claim
they O-claim
came O-claim
out O-claim
messy O-claim
and O-claim
hurtful O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
destroyed O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
close O-claim
friendships O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
come O-claim
to O-claim
have O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
stayed O-claim
home O-claim
most O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
time O-claim
, O-claim
never O-claim
wanting O-claim
to O-claim
hang O-claim
out O-claim
, O-claim
most O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
summer O-claim
consisted O-claim
of O-claim
being O-claim
home O-claim
or O-claim
hanging O-claim
out O-claim
with O-claim
neighbors O-claim
. O-claim

Now O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
a O-claim
helpless O-claim
body O-claim
through O-claim
my O-claim
own O-claim
raging O-claim
river O-claim
, O-claim
hitting O-claim
rock O-claim
after O-claim
rock O-claim
, O-claim
not O-claim
having O-claim
anyway O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

Everyone O-claim
who O-claim
was O-claim
close O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
beginning O-claim
of O-claim
middle O-claim
school O-claim
, O-claim
seems O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
gone O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
no O-claim
longer O-claim
have O-claim
my O-claim
bestfriend O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
no O-claim
longer O-claim
have O-claim
my O-claim
group O-claim
of O-claim
friends O-claim

2018 O-claim

Winter O-claim
of O-claim
junior O-claim
year O-claim
was O-claim
coming O-claim
to O-claim
an O-claim
end O-claim
and O-claim
softball O-claim
season O-claim
was O-claim
about O-claim
to O-claim
begin O-claim
my O-claim
world O-claim
was O-claim
shaken O-claim
. O-claim

Tryouts O-claim
were O-claim
happening O-claim
tomorrow O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
scared O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
was O-claim
hopeful O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
the O-claim
team O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
order O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
some O-claim
extra O-claim
practice O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
to O-claim
East O-claim
Lake O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
teaching O-claim
a O-claim
younger O-claim
girl O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
play O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
, O-claim
something O-claim
happened O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
girl O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
leave O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
think O-claim
anything O-claim
was O-claim
wrong O-claim
. O-claim

Yet O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
went O-claim
back O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
car O-claim
I O-claim
saw O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
sitting O-claim
there O-claim
looking O-claim
like O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
crying O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
shocked O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
saw O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
cry O-claim
before O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
only O-claim
other O-claim
time O-claim
I O-claim
saw O-claim
her O-claim
weak O-claim
and O-claim
fragile O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
hospital O-claim
after O-claim
her O-claim
heart O-claim
attack O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
asked O-claim
what O-claim
was O-claim
wrong O-claim
and O-claim
never O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
assumed O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
hear O-claim
. O-claim

Grandma O-claim
died O-claim
. O-claim

With O-claim
that O-claim
simple O-claim
phrase O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
world O-claim
was O-claim
transformed O-claim
and O-claim
not O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
better O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
Saturday O-claim
night O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
out O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
friends O-claim
and O-claim
when O-claim
she O-claim
came O-claim
home O-claim
she O-claim
got O-claim
ready O-claim
for O-claim
bed O-claim
and O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
read O-claim
. O-claim

Sunday O-claim
morning O-claim
comes O-claim
and O-claim
her O-claim
friends O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
pick O-claim
her O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
ready O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
answering O-claim
the O-claim
phone O-claim
. O-claim

A O-claim
neighbor O-claim
has O-claim
a O-claim
key O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
house O-claim
and O-claim
they O-claim
come O-claim
in O-claim
and O-claim
there O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
lying O-claim
in O-claim
her O-claim
bed O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
book O-claim
in O-claim
her O-claim
hands O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
cops O-claim
showed O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
they O-claim
needed O-claim
to O-claim
alert O-claim
the O-claim
next O-claim
of O-claim
kin O-claim
what O-claim
happened O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
Florida O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
next O-claim
of O-claim
kin O-claim
was O-claim
my O-claim
mother O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
one O-claim
that O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
could O-claim
n't O-claim
believe O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
to O-claim
do O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
just O-claim
remember O-claim
crying O-claim
for O-claim
as O-claim
long O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
lifetime O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
went O-claim
home O-claim
to O-claim
pick O-claim
up O-claim
my O-claim
brother O-claim
and O-claim
that O-claim
's O-claim
when O-claim
he O-claim
found O-claim
out O-claim
. O-claim

Then O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
text O-claim
my O-claim
cousin O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
sure O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
home O-claim
so O-claim
we O-claim
could O-claim
go O-claim
over O-claim
and O-claim
let O-claim
them O-claim
know O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
we O-claim
got O-claim
to O-claim
their O-claim
house O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
went O-claim
and O-claim
told O-claim
her O-claim
brother O-claim
. O-claim

He O-claim
screamed O-claim
then O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
bawl O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
phone O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
ring O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
n't O-claim
pick O-claim
it O-claim
up O-claim
. O-claim

Shortly O-claim
after O-claim
but O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
forever O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
uncle O-claim
went O-claim
in O-claim
and O-claim
told O-claim
my O-claim
cousins O-claim
and O-claim
we O-claim
went O-claim
in O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
house O-claim
. O-claim

There O-claim
was O-claim
my O-claim
aunt O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
two O-claim
cousins O-claim
there O-claim
crying O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
went O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
older O-claim
cousin O-claim
, O-claim
who O-claim
is O-claim
much O-claim
taller O-claim
than O-claim
me O-claim
to O-claim
hug O-claim
and O-claim
comfort O-claim
him O-claim
, O-claim
then O-claim
my O-claim
younger O-claim
cousin O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
aunt O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
day O-claim
was O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
day O-claim
I O-claim
ever O-claim
saw O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
tears O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
all O-claim
hung O-claim
out O-claim
that O-claim
night O-claim
trying O-claim
to O-claim
put O-claim
it O-claim
into O-claim
perspective O-claim
and O-claim
let O-claim
our O-claim
siblings O-claim
who O-claim
were O-claim
away O-claim
at O-claim
school O-claim
know O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
made O-claim
memories O-claim
that O-claim
we O-claim
wish O-claim
we O-claim
made O-claim
with O-claim
a O-claim
different O-claim
situation O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
that O-claim
night O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
week O-claim
before O-claim
the O-claim
wake O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
funeral O-claim
and O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
complete O-claim
blur O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
went O-claim
through O-claim
the O-claim
motions O-claim
at O-claim
school O-claim
and O-claim
at O-claim
practice O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
over O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
, O-claim
including O-claim
my O-claim
cousins O-claim
will O-claim
all O-claim
hang O-claim
out O-claim
and O-claim
go O-claim
out O-claim
to O-claim
dinner O-claim
. O-claim

We O-claim
were O-claim
each O-claim
others O-claim
' O-claim
comfort O-claim
. O-claim

All O-claim
of O-claim
us O-claim
were O-claim
going O-claim
through O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
thing O-claim
, O-claim
since O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
all O-claim
close O-claim
with O-claim
each O-claim
other O-claim
and O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
the O-claim
wake O-claim
and O-claim
funeral O-claim
was O-claim
coming O-claim
closer O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
a O-claim
poster O-claim
with O-claim
pictures O-claim
of O-claim
her O-claim
with O-claim
us O-claim
and O-claim
others O-claim
to O-claim
display O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
display O-claim
showed O-claim
others O-claim
who O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
she O-claim
impacted O-claim
some O-claim
people O-claim
's O-claim
lives O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
, O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
wake O-claim
people O-claim
would O-claim
tell O-claim
stories O-claim
of O-claim
how O-claim
she O-claim
impacted O-claim
them O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
incredible O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
shocking O-claim
things O-claim
was O-claim
seeing O-claim
some O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
best O-claim
friends O-claim
come O-claim
down O-claim
who O-claim
knew O-claim
her O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
close O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
come O-claim
down O-claim
from O-claim
upstate O-claim
or O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
state O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
never O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
thought O-claim
they O-claim
would O-claim
come O-claim
because O-claim
its O-claim
far O-claim
and O-claim
they O-claim
already O-claim
shared O-claim
their O-claim
condolences O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
the O-claim
funeral O-claim
came O-claim
, O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
decided O-claim
to O-claim
write O-claim
a O-claim
letter O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
grandmother O-claim
to O-claim
put O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
casket O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
chose O-claim
to O-claim
speak O-claim
and O-claim
put O-claim
in O-claim
little O-claim
things O-claim
instead O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
put O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
message O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
bottle O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
quote O-claim
, O-claim
Do O-claim
n't O-claim
cry O-claim
because O-claim
it O-claim
's O-claim
over O-claim
; O-claim
smile O-claim
because O-claim
it O-claim
happened O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
party O-claim
favor O-claim
from O-claim
my O-claim
sweet O-claim
sixteen O-claim
that O-claim
now O-claim
meant O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
more O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

Also O-claim
I O-claim
gave O-claim
her O-claim
a O-claim
small O-claim
piece O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
hair O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
small O-claim
joke O-claim
that O-claim
was O-claim
between O-claim
us O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
choose O-claim
to O-claim
speak O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
knew O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
n't O-claim
the O-claim
best O-claim
speaker O-claim
but O-claim
that O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
matter O-claim
, O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
talked O-claim
about O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

Instead O-claim
of O-claim
writing O-claim
a O-claim
whole O-claim
speech O-claim
and O-claim
printing O-claim
it O-claim
out O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
just O-claim
wrote O-claim
bullets O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
phone O-claim
on O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
talk O-claim
about O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
reverend O-claim
was O-claim
done O-claim
and O-claim
called O-claim
me O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
speak O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
scared O-claim
to O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
to O-claim
talk O-claim
in O-claim
front O-claim
of O-claim
all O-claim
these O-claim
people O-claim
about O-claim
someone O-claim
that O-claim
meant O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
and O-claim
show O-claim
my O-claim
emotions O-claim
fully O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
up O-claim
though O-claim
, O-claim
for O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
deserved O-claim
for O-claim
people O-claim
to O-claim
hear O-claim
about O-claim
what O-claim
she O-claim
means O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
she O-claim
has O-claim
impacted O-claim
and O-claim
changed O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
started O-claim
with O-claim
how O-claim
she O-claim
cared O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
always O-claim
knew O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
sick O-claim
even O-claim
before O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
because O-claim
she O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
see O-claim
the O-claim
sparkle O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
eyes O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
when O-claim
she O-claim
was O-claim
away O-claim
she O-claim
would O-claim
call O-claim
and O-claim
say O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
she O-claim
missed O-claim
her O-claim
Julia O-claim
hugs O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
always O-claim
knew O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
me O-claim
smile O-claim
and O-claim
laugh O-claim
, O-claim
yet O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
always O-claim
make O-claim
sure O-claim
to O-claim
give O-claim
her O-claim
an O-claim
extra O-claim
hug O-claim
with O-claim
extra O-claim
love O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
just O-claim
talked O-claim
how O-claim
we O-claim
were O-claim
nothing O-claim
extra O-claim
special O-claim
but O-claim
the O-claim
little O-claim
things O-claim
that O-claim
were O-claim
for O-claim
us O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
she O-claim
just O-claim
wanted O-claim
my O-claim
hair O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
beautiful O-claim
it O-claim
is O-claim
and O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
happy O-claim
with O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

Also O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
spoke O-claim
about O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
she O-claim
loved O-claim
all O-claim
of O-claim
us O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
she O-claim
taught O-claim
me O-claim
life O-claim
lessons O-claim
and O-claim
card O-claim
games O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
'll O-claim
never O-claim
forget O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
grateful O-claim
I O-claim
am O-claim
for O-claim
having O-claim
her O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
this O-claim
long O-claim
and O-claim
spending O-claim
great O-claim
moments O-claim
together O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
I O-claim
ended O-claim
the O-claim
eulogy O-claim
I O-claim
spoke O-claim
of O-claim
how O-claim
she O-claim
is O-claim
with O-claim
my O-claim
grandfather O-claim
now O-claim
and O-claim
how O-claim
we O-claim
will O-claim
all O-claim
miss O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

Throughout O-claim
the O-claim
speech O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
stop O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
getting O-claim
too O-claim
emotional O-claim
but O-claim
who O-claim
would O-claim
n't O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
I O-claim
spoke O-claim
everyone O-claim
else O-claim
was O-claim
crying O-claim
. O-claim

Many O-claim
people O-claim
came O-claim
up O-claim
to O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
said O-claim
how O-claim
strong O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
up O-claim
there O-claim
and O-claim
speak O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
see O-claim
it O-claim
as O-claim
strength O-claim
but O-claim
as O-claim
an O-claim
opportunity O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
put O-claim
it O-claim
in O-claim
realization O-claim
. O-claim

Life O-claim
has O-claim
n't O-claim
been O-claim
the O-claim
same O-claim
and O-claim
some O-claim
moments O-claim
I O-claim
missed O-claim
her O-claim
more O-claim
than O-claim
others O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
I O-claim
still O-claim
write O-claim
her O-claim
emails O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
write O-claim
down O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
send O-claim
in O-claim
an O-claim
email O-claim
to O-claim
her O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
notes O-claim
where O-claim
I O-claim
wrote O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
said O-claim
at O-claim
her O-claim
funeral O-claim
and O-claim
keep O-claim
adding O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
discussed O-claim
different O-claim
important O-claim
events O-claim
that O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
happening O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
email O-claim
her O-claim
about O-claim
or O-claim
call O-claim
her O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
loss O-claim
never O-claim
got O-claim
easier O-claim
especially O-claim
since O-claim
I O-claim
lived O-claim
with O-claim
her O-claim
every O-claim
summer O-claim
since O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
born O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
summer O-claim
was O-claim
extremely O-claim
hard O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
lucky O-claim
since O-claim
my O-claim
friends O-claim
were O-claim
there O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
everyday O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
was O-claim
going O-claim
through O-claim
it O-claim
all O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

Losing O-claim
someone O-claim
with O-claim
that O-claim
much O-claim
meaning O-claim
in O-claim
your O-claim
life O-claim
is O-claim
hard O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
everything O-claim
in O-claim
your O-claim
life O-claim
has O-claim
meaning O-claim
even O-claim
if O-claim
you O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
know O-claim
why O-claim
or O-claim
wish O-claim
it O-claim
has O-claim
n't O-claim
happened O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
all O-claim
has O-claim
a O-claim
purpose O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
little O-claim
things O-claim
in O-claim
life O-claim
matters O-claim
the O-claim
most O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
always O-claim
wanted O-claim
something O-claim
that O-claim
nearly O-claim
everyone O-claim
had O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
never O-claim
got O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
got O-claim
older O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
feel O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
missing O-claim
something O-claim
important O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
of O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
this O-claim
would O-claim
impact O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
until O-claim
it O-claim
did O-claim
. O-claim

On O-claim
July O-claim
15 O-claim
2004 O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
passed O-claim
away O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
born O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
mouth O-claim
after O-claim
on O-claim
December O-claim
27 O-claim
2004 O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
lost O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
before O-claim
I O-claim
even O-claim
met O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
never O-claim
realize O-claim
what O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
without O-claim
a O-claim
Dad O-claim
but O-claim
when O-claim
did O-claim
learned O-claim
how O-claim
to O-claim
overcome O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

Growing O-claim
up O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
Dad O-claim
often O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
hid O-claim
it O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
back O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
trying O-claim
to O-claim
imagine O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
positive O-claim
things O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
a O-claim
young O-claim
child O-claim
was O-claim
always O-claim
with O-claim
family O-claim
so O-claim
my O-claim
Dad O-claim
never O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
mind O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
will O-claim
amite O-claim
maybe O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
spoiled O-claim
by O-claim
my O-claim
Grandparents O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
never O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
missing O-claim
anything O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
always O-claim
obtain O-claim
what O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
like O-claim
news O-claim
toys O-claim
or O-claim
my O-claim
favorite O-claim
snacks O-claim
. O-claim

Life O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
was O-claim
grand O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
on O-claim
top O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
and O-claim
nothing O-claim
could O-claim
bring O-claim
me O-claim
down O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
sometimes O-claim
instead O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
top O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
it O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
darkest O-claim
part O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
deep O-claim
ocean O-claim
. O-claim

When O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
young O-claim
child O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
move O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
and O-claim
since O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
stand O-claim
out O-claim
a O-claim
lot O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
have O-claim
many O-claim
friends O-claim
. O-claim

Around O-claim
when O-claim
was O-claim
like O-claim
6 O-claim
my O-claim
grandpa O-claim
and O-claim
mom O-claim
had O-claim
told O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
also O-claim
my O-claim
brother O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
grandma O-claim
was O-claim
sick O-claim
. O-claim

She O-claim
passed O-claim
away O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
months O-claim
later O-claim
from O-claim
cancer O-claim
that O-claim
spread O-claim
like O-claim
wildfire O-claim
through O-claim
her O-claim
body O-claim
. O-claim

And O-claim
that O-claim
's O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
thought O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
be O-claim
best O-claim
to B-claim
move I-claim
us I-claim
to I-claim
Michigan I-claim
. O-claim

Moving O-claim
to O-claim
Michigan O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
realize O-claim
how O-claim
much O-claim
wished O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
. O-claim

It O-claim
started O-claim
out O-claim
slowly O-claim
but O-claim
got O-claim
stronger O-claim
and O-claim
stronger O-claim
as O-claim
I O-claim
got O-claim
older O-claim
. O-claim

Every O-claim
time O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
father O-claim
day O-claim
we O-claim
would O-claim
make O-claim
something O-claim
for O-claim
them O-claim
in O-claim
class O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
have O-claim
a O-claim
Dad O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
to O-claim
make O-claim
it O-claim
for O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
not O-claim
saying O-claim
it O-claim
wrong O-claim
to O-claim
give O-claim
your O-claim
mom O-claim
a O-claim
father O-claim
day O-claim
gift O-claim
it O-claim
just O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
upset O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
n't O-claim
give O-claim
it O-claim
to O-claim
my O-claim
actual O-claim
Dad O-claim
. O-claim

Another O-claim
thing O-claim
that O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
think O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
Dad O-claim
is O-claim
when O-claim
are O-claim
school O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
donuts O-claim
and O-claim
dad O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
mom O-claim
, O-claim
brother O-claim
and O-claim
little O-claim
sister O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
one O-claim
but O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
other O-claim
years O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
to O-claim
ask O-claim
a O-claim
friend O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
sit O-claim
with O-claim
them O-claim
or O-claim
ask O-claim
a O-claim
teacher O-claim
to O-claim
help O-claim
me O-claim
find O-claim
a O-claim
group O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
felt O-claim
like O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
intruding O-claim
on O-claim
their O-claim
time O-claim
with O-claim
their O-claim
dad O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
last O-claim
thing O-claim
that O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
wish O-claim
I O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
was O-claim
when O-claim
we O-claim
had O-claim
daddy O-claim
daughter O-claim
dances O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
remember O-claim
once O-claim
in O-claim
third O-claim
grade O-claim
I O-claim
found O-claim
myself O-claim
begging O-claim
for O-claim
om O-claim
to O-claim
take O-claim
me O-claim
with O-claim
neer O-claim
tears O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
eyes O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
Mom O-claim
could O-claim
tell O-claim
really O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
we O-claim
could O-claim
n't O-claim
I O-claim
forget O-claim
why O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
for O-claim
something O-claim
important O-claim
. O-claim

Since O-claim
then O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
wonder O-claim
why O-claim
I O-claim
wanted O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
know O-claim
there O-claim
's O-claim
an O-claim
answer O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
back O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
mind O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
just O-claim
have O-claim
n't O-claim
found O-claim
it O-claim
yet O-claim
. O-claim

How O-claim
I O-claim
overcame O-claim
not O-claim
having O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
lift O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
do O-claim
n't O-claim
know O-claim
when O-claim
it O-claim
happen O-claim
but O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
thinking O-claim
of O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
things O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
have O-claim
done O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
realize O-claim
that O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
not O-claim
been O-claim
thinking O-claim
of O-claim
all O-claim
the O-claim
positive O-claim
things O-claim
that O-claim
happen O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
that O-claim
brought O-claim
me O-claim
here O-claim
to O-claim
this O-claim
day O-claim
. O-claim

That O-claim
one O-claim
time O-claim
that O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
, O-claim
brother O-claim
and O-claim
little O-claim
sister O-claim
came O-claim
to O-claim
donuts O-claim
and O-claim
dads O-claim
it O-claim
made O-claim
me O-claim
so O-claim
delighted O-claim
. O-claim

Or O-claim
when O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
realize O-claim
how O-claim
unhappy O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
n't O-claim
get O-claim
to O-claim
go O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
daddy O-claim
daughter O-claim
dance O-claim
she O-claim
took O-claim
the O-claim
next O-claim
year O-claim
and O-claim
my O-claim
brother O-claim
took O-claim
me O-claim
one O-claim
year O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
family O-claim
did O-claim
so O-claim
much O-claim
for O-claim
me O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
even O-claim
realize O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
was O-claim
too O-claim
blind O-claim
to O-claim
see O-claim
it O-claim
all O-claim
because O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
too O-claim
worried O-claim
on O-claim
how O-claim
I O-claim
felt O-claim
on O-claim
not O-claim
having O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
I O-claim
never O-claim
thought O-claim
how O-claim
my O-claim
brother O-claim
must O-claim
have O-claim
felt O-claim
. O-claim

Losing O-claim
a O-claim
dad O-claim
and O-claim
having O-claim
his O-claim
grandparents O-claim
give O-claim
his O-claim
newborn O-claim
sister O-claim
most O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
attention O-claim
. O-claim

And O-claim
my O-claim
mom O-claim
she O-claim
new O-claim
her O-claim
husband O-claim
or O-claim
my O-claim
dad O-claim
since O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
thirteen O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
and O-claim
she O-claim
lost O-claim
him O-claim
when O-claim
they O-claim
were O-claim
twenty O-claim
- O-claim
six O-claim
. O-claim

My O-claim
family O-claim
is O-claim
the O-claim
resin O-claim
why O-claim
I O-claim
do O-claim
not O-claim
feel O-claim
sad O-claim
when O-claim
I O-claim
think O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
Dad O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
always O-claim
wanted O-claim
something O-claim
the O-claim
nearly O-claim
everyone O-claim
had O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
never O-claim
got O-claim
it O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
am O-claim
thirteen O-claim
years O-claim
old O-claim
now O-claim
and O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
lived O-claim
my O-claim
whole O-claim
life O-claim
without O-claim
a O-claim
Dad O-claim
. O-claim

There O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
hard O-claim
times O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
also O-claim
good O-claim
times O-claim
. O-claim

Because O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
family O-claim
mainly O-claim
my O-claim
Mom O-claim
, O-claim
have O-claim
giving O-claim
me O-claim
the O-claim
best O-claim
life O-claim
possible O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
still O-claim
think O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
Dad O-claim
hear O-claim
and O-claim
there O-claim
but O-claim
not O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
sadness O-claim
but O-claim
out O-claim
of O-claim
love O-claim
. O-claim

I O-claim
will O-claim
proudly O-claim
always O-claim
imagine O-claim
what O-claim
it O-claim
would O-claim
have O-claim
been O-claim
like O-claim
to O-claim
live O-claim
with O-claim
a O-claim
Dad O-claim
. O-claim

But O-claim
I O-claim
can O-claim
not O-claim
changes O-claim
what O-claim
have O-claim
happened O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
passed O-claim
. O-claim

Even O-claim
if O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
I O-claim
would O-claim
not O-claim
chance O-claim
what O-claim
had O-claim
happened O-claim
in O-claim
my O-claim
life O-claim
for O-claim
the O-claim
world O-claim
. O-claim

Everyone O-claim
says O-claim
football B-claim
comes I-claim
down I-claim
to I-claim
inches I-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
is O-claim
rare O-claim
to O-claim
witness O-claim
a O-claim
game O-claim
where O-claim
inches O-claim
matter O-claim
. O-claim

Notably O-claim
, O-claim
fans B-claim
might I-claim
see I-claim
a I-claim
fourth I-claim
down I-claim
and I-claim
inches I-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
nothing O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
game O-claim
- O-claim
winning O-claim
touchdown O-claim
that O-claim
comes O-claim
down O-claim
to O-claim
inches O-claim
. O-claim

However O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
was O-claim
fortunate O-claim
to O-claim
attend O-claim
an O-claim
enormous O-claim
game O-claim
that O-claim
did O-claim
emphasize O-claim
the O-claim
importance O-claim
of O-claim
inches O-claim
. O-claim

Finally O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
Christmas O-claim
Day O-claim
in O-claim
Pittsburgh O-claim
, O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
buzz O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
air O-claim
and O-claim
high O-claim
hopes O-claim
for O-claim
4 O-claim
o'clock O-claim
when O-claim
rivals O-claim
would O-claim
take O-claim
center O-claim
stage O-claim
. O-claim

Therefore O-claim
, O-claim
this O-claim
game O-claim
would O-claim
decide O-claim
the O-claim
champion O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
division O-claim
and O-claim
what O-claim
team O-claim
would O-claim
advance O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
playoffs O-claim
. O-claim

Surprisingly O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
arrived O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
around O-claim
11 O-claim
o'clock O-claim
. O-claim

There O-claim
was O-claim
a O-claim
negligible O-claim
overcast O-claim
, O-claim
with O-claim
temperatures O-claim
near O-claim
35 O-claim
degrees O-claim
. O-claim

Finally O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
entered O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
; O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
prodigious O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
humongous O-claim
screen O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
open O-claim
end O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Ohio O-claim
River O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
distance O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
shadow O-claim
enclosed O-claim
the O-claim
field O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
giant O-claim
blocking O-claim
the O-claim
sun O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
shadow O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
practically O-claim
covered O-claim
every O-claim
yellow O-claim
seat O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
soon O-claim
as O-claim
we O-claim
walked O-claim
through O-claim
the O-claim
corridors O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
could O-claim
smell O-claim
the O-claim
fried O-claim
food O-claim
already O-claim
. O-claim

With O-claim
that O-claim
in O-claim
mind O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
food O-claim
smelt O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
backyard O-claim
barbeque O-claim
. O-claim

Once O-claim
we O-claim
reached O-claim
our O-claim
seats O-claim
, O-claim
which O-claim
were O-claim
approximately O-claim
20 O-claim
rows O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
walked O-claim
down O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
front O-claim
row O-claim
for O-claim
an O-claim
exceptional O-claim
view O-claim
. O-claim

Obviously O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
was O-claim
roaring O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
loud O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
thunderstorm O-claim
, O-claim
after O-claim
the O-claim
opening O-claim
kickoff O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
seats O-claim
in O-claim
front O-claim
of O-claim
us O-claim
were O-claim
empty O-claim
. O-claim

Suddenly O-claim
, O-claim
we O-claim
distinguished O-claim
a O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
start O-claim
walking O-claim
down O-claim
the O-claim
row O-claim
right O-claim
in O-claim
front O-claim
of O-claim
us O-claim
. O-claim

Of O-claim
course O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
had O-claim
a O-claim
beer O-claim
in O-claim
hand O-claim
, O-claim
appeared O-claim
to O-claim
be O-claim
hammered O-claim
already O-claim
and O-claim
also O-claim
smelt O-claim
like O-claim
beer O-claim
. O-claim

Alongside O-claim
the O-claim
drunk O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
, O-claim
was O-claim
his O-claim
friend O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
touchdown O-claim
, O-claim
his O-claim
friend O-claim
went O-claim
to O-claim
buy O-claim
another O-claim
beer O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
come O-claim
back O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
drunk O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
stop O-claim
talking O-claim
about O-claim
his O-claim
friend O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
short O-claim
while O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
hope O-claim
that O-claim
he O-claim
did O-claim
not O-claim
get O-claim
arrested O-claim
because O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
away O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
long O-claim
time O-claim
. O-claim

Meanwhile O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
told O-claim
him O-claim
, O-claim
Maybe O-claim
he O-claim
is O-claim
lost O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
you O-claim
should O-claim
take O-claim
a O-claim
hike O-claim
and O-claim
look O-claim
for O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
the O-claim
first O-claim
quarter O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
were O-claim
ahead O-claim
seven O-claim
to O-claim
three O-claim
. O-claim

Generally O-claim
speaking O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
second O-claim
quarter O-claim
started O-claim
off O-claim
with O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
turning O-claim
it O-claim
over O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
soon O-claim
as O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
stopped O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
right O-claim
ahead O-claim
of O-claim
us O-claim
started O-claim
jumping O-claim
up O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
kangaroo O-claim
and O-claim
cheering O-claim
with O-claim
a O-claim
beer O-claim
in O-claim
hand O-claim
. O-claim

While O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
cheering O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
spilled O-claim
his O-claim
beer O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
gentleman O-claim
's O-claim
jersey O-claim
. O-claim

Without O-claim
delay O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
gentleman O-claim
turned O-claim
around O-claim
and O-claim
said O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
polite O-claim
voice O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
have O-claim
no O-claim
problem O-claim
cheering O-claim
for O-claim
your O-claim
team O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
the O-claim
spilling O-claim
of O-claim
beer O-claim
on O-claim
people O-claim
is O-claim
not O-claim
acceptable O-claim
. O-claim

Straight O-claim
away O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
dog O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
leash O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
put O-claim
his O-claim
beer O-claim
down O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
he O-claim
turned O-claim
around O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
smell O-claim
the O-claim
beer O-claim
in O-claim
his O-claim
breath O-claim
, O-claim
it O-claim
smelt O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
skunk O-claim
that O-claim
just O-claim
sprayed O-claim
a O-claim
dog O-claim
. O-claim

By O-claim
the O-claim
time O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
reached O-claim
halftime O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
score O-claim
was O-claim
seven O-claim
to O-claim
six O-claim
. O-claim

All O-claim
in O-claim
all O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
second O-claim
half O-claim
would O-claim
start O-claim
with O-claim
an O-claim
interception O-claim
and O-claim
a O-claim
quick O-claim
touchdown O-claim
to O-claim
put O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
ahead O-claim
fourteen O-claim
to O-claim
seven O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
soon O-claim
as O-claim
that O-claim
happened O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
shook O-claim
my O-claim
head O-claim
and O-claim
took O-claim
a O-claim
drink O-claim
of O-claim
my O-claim
water O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
water O-claim
tasted O-claim
very O-claim
similar O-claim
to O-claim
well O-claim
water O-claim
. O-claim

Quickly O-claim
after O-claim
the O-claim
touchdown O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
hammered O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
became O-claim
ecstatic O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
was O-claim
cheering O-claim
, O-claim
as O-claim
loud O-claim
as O-claim
an O-claim
elephant O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
he O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
brag O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
fans O-claim
around O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

Finally O-claim
, O-claim
one O-claim
guy O-claim
approximately O-claim
six O-claim
rows O-claim
down O-claim
turned O-claim
around O-claim
and O-claim
hollered O-claim
, O-claim
Sit O-claim
your O-claim
ass O-claim
down O-claim
! O-claim

Shortly O-claim
after O-claim
that O-claim
, O-claim
another O-claim
fan O-claim
shouted O-claim
: O-claim
Sit O-claim
down O-claim
before O-claim
I O-claim
come O-claim
kick O-claim
your O-claim
ass O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
more O-claim
field O-claim
goals O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
tipsy O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
stand O-claim
on O-claim
his O-claim
seat O-claim
to O-claim
watch O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
. O-claim

Once O-claim
this O-claim
happened O-claim
, O-claim
fans O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
irritated O-claim
because O-claim
they O-claim
could O-claim
not O-claim
watch O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
. O-claim

For O-claim
this O-claim
reason O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
tapped O-claim
him O-claim
on O-claim
the O-claim
shoulder O-claim
and O-claim
asked O-claim
: O-claim
Can O-claim
you O-claim
get O-claim
off O-claim
your O-claim
seat O-claim
so O-claim
that O-claim
others O-claim
can O-claim
watch O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
too O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
response O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
hammered O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fans O-claim
yelled O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
paid O-claim
top O-claim
dollar O-claim
for O-claim
these O-claim
seats O-claim
so O-claim
I O-claim
could O-claim
observe O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
. O-claim

Determinately O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
countered O-claim
his O-claim
response O-claim
by O-claim
saying O-claim
, O-claim
Everyone O-claim
here O-claim
paid O-claim
top O-claim
dollar O-claim
to O-claim
watch O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
. O-claim

At O-claim
last O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
Alright O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
if O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
gets O-claim
close O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
' O-claim
m O-claim
getting O-claim
back O-claim
up O-claim
there O-claim
. O-claim

As O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
extended O-claim
their O-claim
lead O-claim
to O-claim
ten O-claim
after O-claim
a O-claim
Justin O-claim
Tucker O-claim
field O-claim
goal O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
fourth O-claim
quarter O-claim
started O-claim
as O-claim
quick O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
cheetah O-claim
. O-claim

Shortly O-claim
after O-claim
the O-claim
field O-claim
goal O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
stoned O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
announced O-claim
to O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
fans O-claim
, O-claim
You O-claim
guys O-claim
are O-claim
all O-claim
upbeat O-claim
when O-claim
you O-claim
are O-claim
winning O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
once O-claim
you O-claim
start O-claim
loosing O-claim
, O-claim
you O-claim
guys O-claim
genuinely O-claim
become O-claim
angry O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
response O-claim
to O-claim
his O-claim
trash O-claim
talk O-claim
, O-claim
some O-claim
people O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
rows O-claim
behind O-claim
us O-claim
hollered O-claim
, O-claim
Shut O-claim
the O-claim
hell O-claim
up O-claim
! O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
few O-claim
possessions O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
had O-claim
the O-claim
ball O-claim
with O-claim
a O-claim
minute O-claim
left O-claim
, O-claim
down O-claim
by O-claim
three O-claim
. O-claim

Quickly O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
Steelers O-claim
drove O-claim
down O-claim
the O-claim
field O-claim
to O-claim
inside O-claim
the O-claim
red O-claim
zone O-claim
with O-claim
sixteen O-claim
seconds O-claim
remaining O-claim
. O-claim

The O-claim
stadium O-claim
was O-claim
as O-claim
silent O-claim
as O-claim
a O-claim
mouse O-claim
. O-claim

After O-claim
a O-claim
timeout O-claim
, O-claim
Roethlisberger O-claim
took O-claim
the O-claim
snap O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
gun O-claim
, O-claim
dropped O-claim
back O-claim
and O-claim
rifled O-claim
a O-claim
pass O-claim
to O-claim
Antonio O-claim
Brown O-claim
on O-claim
a O-claim
slant O-claim
. O-claim

Brown O-claim
caught O-claim
it O-claim
in O-claim
stride O-claim
and O-claim
was O-claim
first O-claim
contacted O-claim
at O-claim
the O-claim
1-yard O-claim
line O-claim
by O-claim
a O-claim
Ravens O-claim
defender O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
drug O-claim
the O-claim
defender O-claim
for O-claim
about O-claim
half O-claim
a O-claim
yard O-claim
, O-claim
when O-claim
two O-claim
other O-claim
defenders O-claim
met O-claim
him O-claim
. O-claim

Suddenly O-claim
, O-claim
Brown O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
get O-claim
driven O-claim
back O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
truck O-claim
in O-claim
reverse O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
at O-claim
that O-claim
moment O-claim
Brown O-claim
stretched O-claim
the O-claim
ball O-claim
barely O-claim
across O-claim
the O-claim
goal O-claim
line O-claim
for O-claim
a O-claim
touchdown O-claim
! O-claim

This O-claim
clinched O-claim
the O-claim
division O-claim
and O-claim
eliminated O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
from O-claim
the O-claim
playoffs O-claim
! O-claim

Instantly O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
stadium O-claim
began O-claim
to O-claim
roar O-claim
, O-claim
like O-claim
a O-claim
lion O-claim
, O-claim
you O-claim
could O-claim
barely O-claim
hear O-claim
anything O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
there O-claim
was O-claim
one O-claim
person O-claim
slouched O-claim
down O-claim
in O-claim
his O-claim
seat O-claim
. O-claim

Immediately O-claim
after O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
concluded O-claim
, O-claim
I O-claim
started O-claim
to O-claim
joke O-claim
with O-claim
him O-claim
and O-claim
asked O-claim
him O-claim
, O-claim
Do O-claim
you O-claim
know O-claim
what O-claim
this O-claim
means O-claim
? O-claim

Eventually O-claim
, O-claim
he O-claim
responded O-claim
, O-claim
Yes O-claim
in O-claim
a O-claim
sluggish O-claim
voice O-claim
and O-claim
gave O-claim
me O-claim
a O-claim
handshake O-claim
. O-claim

Meanwhile O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
guy O-claim
that O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
beat O-claim
him O-claim
up O-claim
also O-claim
come O-claim
over O-claim
to O-claim
him O-claim
and O-claim
said O-claim
, O-claim
Great O-claim
game O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
Ravens O-claim
fan O-claim
stared O-claim
at O-claim
him O-claim
and O-claim
responded O-claim
, O-claim
Were O-claim
n't O-claim
you O-claim
the O-claim
one O-claim
that O-claim
just O-claim
wanted O-claim
to O-claim
kick O-claim
my O-claim
ass O-claim
a O-claim
little O-claim
bit O-claim
ago O-claim
? O-claim

Without O-claim
hesitation O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
guy O-claim
responded O-claim
, O-claim
Yeah O-claim
, O-claim
but O-claim
it O-claim
was O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
heat O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
moment O-claim
, O-claim
and O-claim
the O-claim
two O-claim
men O-claim
shook O-claim
hands O-claim
. O-claim

In O-claim
the O-claim
final O-claim
analysis O-claim
, O-claim
the O-claim
game O-claim
would O-claim
go O-claim
down O-claim
in O-claim
the O-claim
2016 O-claim
season O-claim
as O-claim
one O-claim
of O-claim
the O-claim
best O-claim
games O-claim
of O-claim
all O-claim
time O-claim
and O-claim
would O-claim
prove O-claim
that O-claim
football B-claim
is I-claim
won I-claim
and I-claim
lost I-claim
by I-claim
inches I-claim
. O-claim
